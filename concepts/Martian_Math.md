# Martian Math

Martian Math represents an alternative mathematical framework developed by [[people/Kirby_Urner|Kirby Urner]], integrating [[concepts/Synergetics|Fuller's Synergetics]] with educational mathematics through tetrahedral rather than cubic thinking. This approach, developed at [[places/Portland|Portland]]'s [[School_of_Tomorrow|School of Tomorrow]], offers a fundamental reimagining of mathematical education.
