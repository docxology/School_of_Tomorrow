# Octet Truss

The Octet Truss is a three-dimensional space frame structure based on the alternating pattern of octahedra and tetrahedra. Developed by Buckminster Fuller, it represents one of the most efficient force-distributing structural systems in nature and engineering.

### Component Relationships
```yaml
elements:
  octahedron:
    vertices: 6
    edges: 12
    faces: 8
    volume: "√2/3"
  tetrahedron:
    vertices: 4
    edges: 6
    faces: 4
    volume: "√2/12"
  basic_module:
    octahedra: 1
    tetrahedra: 8
    total_volume: "2√2"
```

## Mathematical Framework

### Vector Relationships
1. Strut Forces
\[
\vec{F}_{\text{strut}} = \frac{\vec{F}_{\text{external}}}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

2. Internal Angles
\[
\theta_{\text{octahedral}} = \arccos(-\frac{1}{3}) \approx 109.47°
\]
\[
\theta_{\text{tetrahedral}} = \arccos(-\frac{1}{3}) \approx 109.47°
\]

3. Volume Relationships
\[
V_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{oct}} + 8V_{\text{tet}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} + 8(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{12}) = 2\sqrt{2}
\]
