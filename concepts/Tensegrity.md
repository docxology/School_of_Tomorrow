# Tensegrity

Tensegrity, a term coined by R. Buckminster Fuller from "tensional integrity," represents a structural principle where isolated components under compression exist within a network of continuous tension, creating stable and efficient structures that embody Fuller's principle of "doing more with less."

## Overview

### Definition
