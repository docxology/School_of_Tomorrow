# Language of Wisdom

Language of Wisdom (LoW) is a bottom-up documentation approach to understanding cognitive frameworks and experiential perspectives, developed through the [[organizations/Math4Wisdom|Math4Wisdom]] community and led by [[people/Jere_Northrop|Jere Northrop]] and [[people/Andrius_Kulikauskas|Andrius Kulikauskas]].

## Core Framework

### Foundational Elements
1. Cognitive Documentation
   - Experiential perspectives
   - Abstract thinking
   - Direct experience
   - Consciousness limits

2. Knowledge Systems
   - Mental frameworks
   - Thought patterns
   - Understanding structures
   - Learning processes
