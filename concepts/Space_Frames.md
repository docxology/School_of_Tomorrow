# Space Frames

Space Frames represent a fundamental structural system combining geometric principles with engineering efficiency to create lightweight, strong, and versatile three-dimensional frameworks. These structures distribute forces through a network of interconnected members, achieving remarkable strength-to-weight ratios.

## Core Principles

### Basic Grid Patterns
```ascii
Square Grid:          Triangular Grid:
+----+----+----+     /\  /\  /\
|    |    |    |    /  \/  \/  \
+----+----+----+    \  /\  /\  /
|    |    |    |     \/  \/  \/
+----+----+----+     /\  /\  /\
|    |    |    |    /  \/  \/  \
+----+----+----+    \  /\  /\  /

Diagonal Grid:        Hybrid Grid:
\  |  /  \  |  /    +--\/--+--/\
 \ | /    \ | /     |  /\  |  \/
  \|/      \|/      +\/--\+/--+
  /|\      /|\      |/    \|  /
 / | \    / | \     +--\/--+--\
/  |  \  /  |  \    |  /\  |  /
```

### Layer Configurations
```ascii
Single Layer:         Double Layer:
    Top View             Section
  o---o---o          o===o===o
  |   |   |          |   |   |
  o---o---o          o===o===o
  |   |   |          |   |   |
  o---o---o          o===o===o

Triple Layer:         Connection Detail:
   Section              Node Joint
o===o===o                 o
|   |   |              / | \
o===o===o             o--o--o
|   |   |              \ | /
o===o===o                o

o: Node
-: Member (horizontal)
|: Member (vertical)

## Technical Framework

### Mathematical Foundations
1. Node Coordination
\[
N = \frac{(L+1)(W+1)(D+1)}{k}
\]
Where:
- N = Number of nodes
- L,W,D = Length, Width, Depth in modules
- k = Pattern factor

2. Member Relations
\[
M = \frac{3N}{2} - (L+W+D) + 1
\]
Where M = Number of members

3. Deflection Analysis
\[
\delta_{\text{max}} = \frac{5wL^4}{384EI} \cdot \alpha
\]
Where:
- δ = Maximum deflection
- w = Distributed load
- L = Span length
- E = Elastic modulus
- I = Moment of inertia
- α = Configuration factor

### Load Distribution Patterns

    ============
    \  /  \  /
     \/    \/
      \    /
       \  /
        \/

Lateral Load Response:

    →→→
    ============
    \  /|  \  /
     \/ |   \/
      \ |   /
       \|  /
