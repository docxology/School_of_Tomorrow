# Trimtab

The Trimtab principle, derived from ship steering mechanisms, represents R. Buckminster Fuller's concept of achieving maximum change through minimum, well-placed effort.

## Overview

### Definition
```yaml
trimtab:
  origin: Naval architecture
  metaphor: Ship steering mechanism
  principle: Minimal input, maximum effect
  application: Social and technological change
  fuller_quote: "Call me trimtab"
  epitaph: "Call me trimtab" - Fuller's gravestone
```

### Core Concept
1. Physical Principle
   - Small rudder on main rudder
   - Minimal energy input
   - Maximum steering effect
   - Efficient control

2. Metaphorical Application
   - Strategic intervention
   - Leverage points
   - System change
   - Efficient transformation
