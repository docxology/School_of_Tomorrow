# üõ°Ô∏è Cognitive Security

Cognitive Security refers to the protection and enhancement of human cognitive capabilities, information processing systems, and decision-making frameworks in an increasingly complex information environment. It intersects with [[System_Analysis]], [[Pattern_Recognition]], and [[Digital_Democracy]] while drawing on principles from [[General_Systems_Theory]]. This field has been significantly advanced through research at the [[organizations/Active_Inference_Institute|Active Inference Institute]] in [[places/Crescent_City|Crescent City]], particularly through the work of [[people/Daniel_Ari_Friedman|Daniel Ari Friedman]] and the COGSEC research team.
