# ðŸ§  Active Inference

Active Inference is a fundamental theory explaining how biological and artificial systems perceive, learn, and act in their environment. It integrates with [[System_Behavior]], [[Pattern_Recognition]], and [[Living_Systems]] while providing a mathematical framework for understanding adaptive behavior. The theory has been significantly advanced through the work of the [[organizations/Active_Inference_Institute|Active Inference Institute]] in [[places/Crescent_City|Crescent City]], California, under the leadership of [[people/Daniel_Ari_Friedman|Daniel Ari Friedman]].
