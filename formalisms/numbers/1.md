# One

In [[Buckminster_Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]]'s work, [[1|One]] represents unity and wholeness, but is understood as inherently plural, as expressed in his principle "Unity is plural and at minimum two."

## Overview

### Definition
```yaml
number:
  value: 1
  type: integer
  category: unity/wholeness
  significance:
    - System unity
    - Inherent plurality
    - Minimum relationship
    - Wholeness concept
  fuller_context:
    - Unity is plural
    - System relationships
    - Minimum two
    - Wholeness principle
```

### Key Properties
1. Mathematical Properties
   - Multiplicative identity
   - Unit measure
   - Prime number
   - System basis

2. Synergetic Properties
   - Inherent plurality
   - Relationship minimum
   - System unity
   - Wholeness concept
