## Number Properties

### Synergetic Significance
```yaml
number_properties:
  unity: 
    base: 1
    principle: "Unity is plural and at minimum two"
  minimum_system:
    base: 4
    principle: "Tetrahedral stability"
  vector_equilibrium:
    vertices: 12
    edges: 24
    faces: 14
  transformation:
    base: 5
    principle: "Quanta of change"
```

### Mathematical Relationships
\[
\begin{align*}
1 &\rightarrow \text{Unity (plural)} \\
2 &\rightarrow \text{Minimum relationship} \\
3 &\rightarrow \text{Triangular stability} \\
4 &\rightarrow \text{Tetrahedral system} \\
12 &\rightarrow \text{Vector equilibrium} \\
20 &\rightarrow \text{Icosahedral efficiency}
\end{align*}
\]
