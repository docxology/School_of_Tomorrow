# Harvard University

> A pivotal institution in Fuller's early education and later scientific influence, particularly in the fields of [[Cellular_Tensegrity]] and [[Systems_Philosophy]].

## Historical Significance

### Fuller's Early Years
- Attended 1913-1915
- Expelled twice
- Formative experience that influenced his unconventional approach
- Early exposure to advanced mathematics and engineering concepts

### Later Influence
- Return visits as lecturer
- Collaboration with [[Donald_Ingber]] on [[Cellular_Tensegrity]]
- Influence on biotechnology research
- Archive contributions
