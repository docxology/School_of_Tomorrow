Fossilized tree sap, oft times with \"inclusions\" (insects especially), dating back 40 or 50 million years (or more) is an important extract in the local ecosystem.[Baltic amber](http://www.gplatt.demon.co.uk/baltic.htm) is typically mined off shore, or from a patch of \"blue earth\" in Russia.  Tons of the stuff are recovered every year.I bought some tiny dolls-in-within-dolls for Tara.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjTLav5xZw5EAb8OqsxDZe6LkbFoI8jLK237PsuumOXu_Eb1LWM9AbZ3TY-b-uFZlFP4am14e27N4eP5ijznaBcVrPPIiQWsea9yUv1tGMUKQfRgfTmmE7fuGoCTzQ0Yp6_xdsN/s1600-h/dolls.jpg)",
