  "content": "Regarding this [\"news\" article](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/russian-documents-reveal-desire-sow-racial-discord-violence-u-s-n1008051).\n\n\"The documents were obtained through the Dossier Center, a London-based investigative project funded by Russian opposition figure Mikhail Khodorkovsky. NBC News has not independently verified the materials, but forensic analysis by the Dossier Center appeared to substantiate the communications.\"\n\nSomehow dossiers from England don't impress me anymore. We've made too many wrong turns based on \"British intelligence\". I'm going to use this story as more evidence of British meddling and plans to keep inflaming Russophobia within the North American psyche.\n\nBecause they use the word \"forensic\" they think we sheeple should be impressed. The Mueller Report is already a big part of the history going forward. Any high school history class that doesn't bring up [Guccifer 2](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2020/05/fresh-from-troll-farm.html) is totally bogus in my view, I laugh in their general direction (Monty Python allusion). NBC stinks of police state and militarism very distinctly. That's a network I no longer hold in high esteem, right down there with [CNN](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/08/chicago.html).\n\nI'm still loyal to CBS though.",
