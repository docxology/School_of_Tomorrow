Are they contemporaries?  Do they engage with one another?\u00a0\n\nCasual searching today will bring up Tai-Danae Bradley and Eugenia Cheng among others. I came across the\u00a0former with an already well-formed interest in NLP (natural language processing), and the later thanks to Andrius Kulikauskas, one of our \"for wisdom\" community leaders.\n\nOne of the keywords of STEM culture is \"vector\" which goes with \"vector processing\" along with \"matrix\" and \"tensor\" and whatever else is being appropriated by the Machine Learning (ML) crowd.\u00a0 That's a big crowd these days, and with its star hooked to AI, only the sky seems the limit where bulls in the stock market are concerned.\n\nThe marrying of a vast corpus, stuff people use English for, with vector (so-called linear) algebra, has enabled a kind of nanotube extraction, meant metaphorically.\u00a0 I pull threads from the hairball of some googleplexed vector space, coded to continually remind itself of what it's supposed to be all about (\"attention is all you need\").\u00a0 I'm not the expert.\u00a0 I'm a PATH guy attending to the various word-meaning trajectories in this neighborhood.\n\nFor example, Category Theory is seriously into \"morphisms\" meaning a generative pre-trained transformer will be finding \"morphisms\" in proximity to \"functors\" and \"categories\" and other such ballpark players.\u00a0 Their vectors will be weighted accordingly.\u00a0 The hair around them (same neighborhood) may then be extruded into sensible sentences.\u00a0 The believable \"predictable goo\" oozes forth.\n\nWe've always allowed dolls, idols, fictional entities, to use the pronoun \"I\".\u00a0 There's no crackdown on \"dolls talking\" or really any other object.\u00a0 Through the comic book convention of a talk or thought balloon, pretty much any object is graphically capable of talking and/or thinking.\u00a0 The strong expectation around AI is we'll have some \"I\" to talk to, \"I to I\".\u00a0 What would Martin Buber say about ChatGPT I wonder?\u00a0 Why not ask her (\"hey Siri...\")?\u00a0 She'll oblige with her fresh-squeezed toothpaste.\n\nAn ulterior motive of mine, for learning some CT, is my wish to cover the obvious bases when it comes to exporting Synergetics to other namespaces.\u00a0 CT is a \"glue language\" for Stemites in general.\u00a0 I was thinking if I could use CT for bridging purposes, I might help Synergetics get some more crew.",
