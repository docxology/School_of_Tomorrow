  "content": "[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3208317309/)I drove to [the place on NE 33rd](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3208313679/) where [the Google Streets car](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/phantom-band.html) turned [by the Oregon Food Bank](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3209260960/), a former client.Google Maps helpfully demarcates [Streets View coverage](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/12/google-street-view.html), when you drag the little person icon onto the map, so [finding this turn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3208415679/) was [no problem](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3208313229/).[Dignity Village](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/12/checking-global-data.html), not currently included in [the dodeca-cam archive](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/06/immersion-experience.html), is [experimentally prototypical](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/summer-camp.html) of the small, remote ([sometimes extremely](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/06/xrl-meeting-space.html)) campus of tomorrow, featuring local self government, some permaculture, plenty of bandwidth (potentially), and easy enough access to transportation (PDX is adjacent, while the #10 stops right outside [the main gate](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3208315485/)).Today was bright and cold, with a strong east wind from up the Columbia Gorge.The weather wasn't severe enough to keep us off the water however.  Brenda of Washington DC, and [Leslie of Multnomah's Friendly Care Committee](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3209163364/in/photostream/) joined us in this Wanderers head office for a pow wow.  I dug out [the Bucky play brochure](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/more-adult-education.html) and talked about Doug Tompos, the actor, coming on the boat last year.Given Leslie is highly trained as a teacher, I was happy to get some pointers on my technique after [explaining the gist of public key cryptography](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3208317995/) to her, a topic she thought might be of interest to Montessori students.Welcome back Alexia, after a long drive from Tennessee, looking forward to seeing you once you get settled.",
