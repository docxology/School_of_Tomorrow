Prying apart fiction from non-fiction is not always as easy as some pretend.\u00a0 He provides missing puzzle pieces.\n\nMy sense of not needing to pry these apart at every turn, carried me into Peter Bechtold's talk, giving the history of Syria, the heartland of the Holy Land, as they called it in President Wilson's day.\n\nSure, Wilson sounds racist by today's standards but that doesn't make him a complete idiot. Peter sees Wilson relegated to the sidelines as French and British create their own narrative around what happened in the Middle East, subsequent to the end of the Ottoman Era.\n\nThe kinds of maps Peter showed of Syria, showing patchworks by micro-climate, language, religion (ethnicity) could be used with North America as well. However as Peter restated several times, these were static snapshots from an earlier time.\u00a0 Much has transpired.\n\nGiven we're in Portland, how the District of Columbia sees the world remains influential.\u00a0 Peter knows a lot of people and has great respect for many of them.\u00a0 He's no fan of the New American Century PR or what the neocons have accomplished, using perhaps dated terminology.\u00a0 Richard Perle and like that.\n\nDr. Bechtold volunteered that he had no inside information on events in Idlib, site of the chemical attack in early April, 2017.\u00a0 The relevant international bodies have not confirmed the Assad government still has any chemical weapons, nor was there clear motivation to use them.\u00a0 I share his skepticism.\n\nAnyway, Wilson probably had the right idea, about providing peoples in the region with more apparatus for self determination.\u00a0 The arbitrary boundaries and agreements made by English and French social engineers have not withstood the test of time.",
