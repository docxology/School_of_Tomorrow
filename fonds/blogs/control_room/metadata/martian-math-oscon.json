We may rely on context, using customary locutions to convey our meanings.\n\nIn XYZ language, we would not say all four quadrays are \"basis vectors\" because one of them (any one) is a linear combination of the the other three.\u00a0 If, that is, we allow negation as a part of our cloning, scaling and tip-to-tail addition process.\n\nAdd any three quadrays and flip the result to get the fourth.\u00a0 In other words:\n\n(1,0,0,0) +\n(0,1,0,0) +\n(0,0,1,0) =\n(1,1,1,0)\n\nand\n\n-(1,1,1,0) =\n(-1,-1,-1,0) =\n(0,0,0,1).\u00a0 \n\nIn the shoptalk of Quadrays, negation (flipping direction) is certainly defined and allowed, but is not required to span space (by means of cloning, scaling, adding) nor to augment the basis vector set.\n\nScaling without negation just means adjusting a length, making it longer or shorter but with no change in direction.\u00a0 Negation adds the directional flip.\n\nWe can flip Quadrays, however the four basis rays are independent of one another in the sense that no three create the fourth without flipping i.e. through scaling and adding alone.\n\nOn the other hand, we may say four quadrays are \"codependent\" in that the tetrahedron is our primitive conceptual beginning, a first otherness begetting awareness.\u00a0 Conceptualization begins with containment, a sense of being \"within\" or \"without\" (cite Plato's Cave).\u00a0 XYZ uses a cube as its corresponding hallmark.\n\n\"That's a really geeky answer\" said the geek by the food truck, awaiting his burrito (as I was).\u00a0 I nodded.\u00a0 We were there to geek out.",
