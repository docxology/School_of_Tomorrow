The pet industry moves [exotic animals](http://www.bornfreeusa.org/facts.php?p=187&more=1) around the world, and these tend to escape, and find each other\u00a0 If the surrounding ecosystem is congenial, the species becomes established.\n\nPatrick used to work at a national lab (Sandia) and is a trained problem solver.\u00a0 When BP accidentally uncorked an oil well in the Gulf, Patrick was right away building [prototype solutions](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/05/empirical-studies.html) in his backyard, ready to jump in and help if he could.\n\nPythons are difficult to find.\u00a0 They're camouflaged and excellent hiders\u00a0 They're cold blooded, so drones using infrared are not likely to pick them up.\n\nEmpirical experiments, which Patrick shared, suggest people do not find pythons in the wild efficiently.\u00a0 They're not a great food given the mercury levels. \u00a0 There's not much motivation to slog through the Everglades looking for hard-to-find snakes.\n\nFlorida's wild life managers have been [casting about](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/03/ban-constrictors.html) for more ideas about how to manage the python population.\u00a0 Patrick has been developing a solution:\u00a0 a new model of snake trap.\u00a0 He's studied the existing 12 patents for snake traps, which are mostly indiscriminate in what they trap.\n\nJohn Humphrey's large reptile trap ([US8407931](http://www.google.com/patents/US8407931)) is discriminant for large, heavy animals.\u00a0 I have something similar (not as long) that I got at a garage sale, thinking to \"have a heart\" vis-a-vis the attic squirrels.\n\nPatrick wants to bring affordable AI into the equations, building a better snake trap that could provide (1) unattended mode for months (b) discriminate to catch only pythons (c) allow remote human intervention (d) provide a means of doing population research in the wild.\n\nThe trap is both tubular and modular, with a catcher up front and an attractant at the back, i.e. bait.\u00a0 Patrick is looking at various urine scents, dispensed freshly.\n\nThe Python computer language is a strong player when it comes to image \nanalysis tools and Patrick's algorithms figure out, from a snapshot in \nthe \"boudoir\" module, whether the trapped animal is indeed a python or not.\n\nThose administering the trap will decide if it's a death trap.\u00a0 Rather than have the python stuck in the trap, decaying, a poison that doesn't have aftereffects, [such as Warfarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warfarin) (used on rats), might do the job.\u00a0 After a quick injection, the python is free to leave.\n\nKeeping the apparatus powered is a challenge in itself.\u00a0 The Raspberry Pi, an off the shelf computer, is too power hungry to keep on around the clock.\u00a0 An Arduino board, far lower in power consumption, is triggered by the capturing module to boot the Pi, so the photo-identification phase may occur.\n\nA communications grid is contemplated:\u00a0 the traps relay information back to headquarters by means of an ad hoc mesh network, [using B.A.T.M.A.N](https://www.open-mesh.org/projects/open-mesh/wiki) for example.\n\nPatrick's research continues.\u00a0 He has a provisional patent and prototyped components.\u00a0 He's hoping to test and refine his device in Gainsville, Florida.\u00a0 He's in communication with the wild life managers.\n\nWe had a lively Q&A session.\u00a0 Glenn wondered about the applicability to [CRISPR technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR) to the python problem, a genetic engineering approach that was the focus of the most recent ISEPP lecture, which I missed. Or how about [a TNR program](http://www.alleycat.org/casefortnr) for pythons?\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/3441042342/in/photolist-JotGm-88zTxe-7YZyV9-7VL8Jp-7jmdc3-74eYBc-6YjmKA-6WN5vV-6VMULj-6RHvR1-6RDrSn-6MSrNZ-6BzqRn-6zsuZG-6vrBGY-6oqhZw-6kGm92-6ihQkk-6huZxk-6f5f1f-6f158x-6bjahs-6bf4dP-6aGArY-6aAzP1-6aAA4L-6aaRf8-69nhsX-68MkUJ-67azJt-673oPb-66Y9EF-66H4XY-5Y4G7S-5Y5tMo-5UUxHh-5TXt6p-5SoDdA-5QZrB2-5JqPnB-5JqvgV-5GV92q-5z8xTe-5zcNW5-54jxvj-2ypu4p-2ypGPB-Joy8X-JotCu-9rQ3QP)",
