This monument was designed specifically to memorialize women, and a great many names appear thereon, sometimes grouped by organization.\n\nThe WILPF section is two or three stones of names towards one end.\u00a0 I'm not sure how the monument is managed as to whether more names might be added.\u00a0 Either way, I'm glad for this monument, though I'm biased given mom's name is inscribed thereon, next to that of Mary Bolton.\n\nSonya Pinney, not named (she's self effacing) was at the event, as observant as ever, seems to me.\u00a0 She'd been digging through the recent issue of Western Friend and seeing letters replying to my article (two long ones).\u00a0 That had led her back to the article itself in the previous issue, so we had quite a bit to talk about, comparing notes.\n\nThen I had to attend to my car, moving it and the wheel chair to a next terminus, where the march would end.\n\nYes, the women marched with their WILPF banners quite a few blocks.\n\nFor some of that time, I was talking with Joel, a Food Not Bomber connected with Unitarians, and grabbing a quick salad at Safeway, catching up with the women at the Eliot Center.\n\nFor those into digging, the slides embedded in the show above are but a sampling, with more in the Photostream.\n\nI won't try narrating the entire program in Eliot Center, save to say I took Eleanor home a little early, as she'd had all the fun she could bear, as [my wife Dawn](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/09/autobiographical-interlude.html) was wont to say.\u00a0 Also, I caught up with Elizabeth, [Ben Linder's mom](http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-6828-remembering_ben.html), just a little.\n\nCarol, who made at least three speeches over the span of the \nprogram, was pretty exuberant the whole time, on not much sleep, and \ncrashed upon our arrival home.\n\nGiven all the logistics involved, and how much time had \ngone into the planning, I'd say stress levels were somewhat high, but \nthat we all worked together on pulling it off.\u00a0\u00a0 Part of my job was staying peripheral, an unobtrusive observer, similar to my role [at Disarm Day](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/08/disarm-day-2015.html).\u00a0 My camera and I wandered off into the surrounding context, capturing a slice of Portland in the Fall of 2015.\n\nMaking Sarah-the-dog hold it for so long was an oversight on my part and I phoned Deke rather late in the game to please check up on her if in the neighborhood.\u00a0 I didn't have a clear grasp of the script we were following and imagined getting home earlier.\n\nCongratulations to WILPF on a hundred years of focused work.\u00a0 May the next hundred be likewise invested in having the world become a more humane place.\u00a0 Lets hope we get to look back on continued progress, with thanks to our heroines for showing a way forward.",
