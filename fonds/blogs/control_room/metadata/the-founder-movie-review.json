  "content": "I like having this review in sequence with Suburbicon (below) as both are set in the 1950s and roll forward towards our time.\u00a0 The Founder is about Ray Kroc and the story behind the McDonald's franchise.\n\nDeke came over to watch it with me.\u00a0 I picked it up from Glenn at lunch over at his apartment.\u00a0 This copy is from Multnomah County Library.\u00a0 I'll return it tomorrow.\n\nIn the Quaker circles I frequent, we inherit from way back the idea of a utopian business, like a company town that really provides.\u00a0 I think religious orders that make chocolate or beer, may seem idyllic in the same way, at least from a distance. There's no need to grow bigger.\n\nRay starts with his country club friends, getting retirees to park their savings in his new restaurants.\u00a0 Then he hires mom and pop couples who get the vision and stick to the script.\u00a0 However as the franchiser he's not meeting expenses nor has he the leverage he needs.\n\nThe McDonald brothers who started the whole show in San Bernardino had tried franchising but didn't see a way to maintain quality.\u00a0 The solution, according to the movie, came not from Croc but the future CEO:\u00a0 make sure you own the land, meaning you can yank the lease if a franchise fails to conform.\n\nI think the \"welcome McDonalds\" scene set in Minnesota tells the real story.\u00a0 Americans were extremely eager to have this restaurant chain spread.\u00a0 Kroc was right to see it as more than just a drive in (they movie doesn't mention the drive through window innovation).\u00a0 He wanted to create a \"religion\".\u00a0 He invented branding in many ways.\n\nDeke stayed to watch the panel discussion as a bonus feature.\u00a0 The actors, producers, and director, as well as McDonald brother grandsons, get to weigh in and share their personal perspective on the making of this 2016 film.\n\nMicheal Keaton, who plays Croc, explains his understanding of the American Dream as something much more modest and attainable than what has become the caricature:\u00a0 making a huge fortune and joining the tiny inner circle of mega-rich and famous.\u00a0 Making that a goal may more likely be a source of nightmares.\n\nI'd like to see the spread of \"company town\" campuses, somewhere between universities and Martian bases (on Earth), in terms of product placing and high technology.\u00a0 Would these towns feature assembly line style kitchens?\u00a0 Maybe so, though not exclusively.\u00a0 I recognize the need for efficiency and appreciate the role of automation.\n\nThis movie takes a \"tip of the iceberg\" look at the more current McDonalds, mostly in the Bonus panel discussion on the DVD.\u00a0 Ronald McDonald, the trademarked clown, is nowhere mentioned, nor the children's hospital.\u00a0 The meat doesn't look frozen.\u00a0 The new shake machines get zero focus.\n\nIn other words, there's room here for many more movies, whether they're ever made is another question.\u00a0 We could make movies forever on the material already stockpiled, yet new generations are anxious to \"[make history](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/03/studying-wars.html)\".",
