Fires in the Mt. Shasta region (Dry Canyon Bridge) have damaged the tracks.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nApparently there's no way to break the route in two and have a bus intertie.\u00a0 That's likely because rail travel is somewhat redundant to air travel in the region, and the passenger rail system doesn't get to treat itself as especially critical.\u00a0 It's more of a luxury, a form of entertainment.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFreight rail, on the other hand, still sees itself as essential and has some way to reroute.\n\nBill favors Papa Haydn, the dessert place, when we can fit it in.\u00a0 We did that last time, visiting their northwest location.\u00a0 This time, we would in theory have time to get to the Milwaukie / Sellwood location, however both establishments are closed Mondays and Tuesdays.\u00a0 Today is a Tuesday.\n\nYesterday we had another gathering in my backyard.\u00a0 Derek (\"Deke\") supplied much of the food from the back of his roving pickup truck, a logistical link in the city's feeding program, decentralized and cybernetic.\n\nA lot of people still believe the world is run by \"bosses\".\u00a0 I agree we have many breeds of crime boss, managing their criminal networks (religions, cults, banks, corporations, gangs, schools, governments).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHowever nature presents us with a more optimized type of efficiency, pre-human, pre-money, pre-conscious.\u00a0 Some philosophers acknowledge these deeper layers of the economy.\u00a0 Others are apparently oblivious.",
