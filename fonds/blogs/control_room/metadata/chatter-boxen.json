  "content": "Something unkind to say about a person is that so-and-so is a chatter box.\u00a0 This kind of put down may be less necessary in cultures where people are more glued to their devices and therefore more likely to delegate chattering to the professional chatterboxen who do it for a living.\n\nBringing up Hugh Kenner at this juncture is a kind of no-brainer.\u00a0 He was writing about Eliza and such early in the computer revolution.\u00a0 I have a distinct memory of him getting Eliza and Racter to talk with one another (\"talk\") in an article in Byte Magazine (McGraw-Hill) for which he wrote a column.\n\nOne needn't have a highly developed sense of irony to see everyone cranking out variations of the same article.\u00a0 The writer does some \"research\" (reads other articles), then \"digests\", then puts it back out there in a grammatical form.\u00a0 Does the chatter box do any less?\u00a0 The game is to get the next word right.\u00a0 Stick to beaten paths.\n\nNaturally the chatter boxen trigger various insecurities.\u00a0 The automated dolls, the miniature robots, made by the French, were unsettling back then (around the time of The Turk).",
