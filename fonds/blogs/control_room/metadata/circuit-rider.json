I had [the Greg Palast movie](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/02/the-best-democracy-money-can-buy-movie.html) to return, so headed out on foot by Movie Madness. Although this tap room and retail establishment started out near to Horse Brass on Belmont (hence the name) as retail only, it moved to Stark Street, just a block down from the Quaker meetinghouse.\n\nI've met with Friends at Belmont Station quite a few times, sometimes to go over math concepts, as I'm known to float around in math tutor space. However this time I was sharing perspectives with Patrick about some hefty RFPs he's been looking at (Requests for Proposals). I've been looking at them as well.\n\nBefore November of last year, I was hell bent on ramping up professional development classes for Portland teachers. I got the idea from doing PD for Californian IT workers, in a program geared for the already-employed.\n\nMy venue, I hoped, might be a neighborhood community center, a church with a lot of floor space. The idea still haunts me, however [Measure 97](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/search?q=measure+97) didn't pass, and even if it had, there's no consensus that teachers want or need PD from the likes of myself or Patrick.\u00a0 We bill ourselves as Python mentors, based on some years with the O'Reilly School of Technology, plus other gigs.\u00a0 Between us, Barton and I have quite a bit of experience.\n\nGlenn and I work on the Global Matrix stuff, which overlaps in that we're looking to display global data using the age-old hexagonal grid motif, with twelve pentagons in the mix.\u00a0 These threads are not unrelated, [in light of HP4E](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/08/hp4e-continued.html), one of my longest running media campaigns (\"Hexapents for Everyone\"). \n\nThe Trimet Trip Planner said I could be at PDX Code Guild if I made it to Glisan, north of Stark, passed Burnside, by 6:24 or so, and I did, having only the one Ninkasi thanks to my host. The bus 19 took me within a couple blocks of [2626 SW Corbett](https://flic.kr/p/SiSHQy), no transfer needed.\u00a0 Pretty nifty.\n\nSheri said she was baking cookies just for me (I think she'd seen on Twitter that I was making my way there). I caught up a little with Ben and collected the T-shirt I'd ordered from one of the other code schoolers some months back. The purpose of Flying Circus in part is for experts to huddle with novices and help them through hurdles. I got to do some of that, as an expert in both Python and JavaScript.\n\nWow, a modern browser sure does a lot, in terms of allowing for inspection, setting breakpoints and so on.\u00a0 Ben really helped a lot.\u00a0 Sheri knows her way around that Trimet Trip Planner developer API, or is getting there (I'd never seen it before, would like to use it more myself).\n\nSince the voter suppression scheme revealed in the Palast movie had involved deliberately sloppy SQL, I was keen to share some of the details.\u00a0 Election technology, like FinTech, is a subset of IT.\u00a0 Code schools have a natural fascination with voting and voting technologies, especially in this age of blockchains.\n\nI stayed late enough to need another e-Ticket to get back, not a problem. I walked down to Tillikum Crossing and hopped an Orange Line, transferring to the 4 at Clinton Street. I was back at Blue House in no time, ready for janitorial duties.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/32794323620/in/dateposted-public/)",
