  "content": "That's a heavy-hearted title.\u00a0 Who knew, when they built this city in the forests, made a Stump Town, then Portlandia, that they were building atop jello pudding.\u00a0 Shake time is roughly 300 years mas o meno.\n\nThere's a sense of the past tense in living here, sweet mortality.\u00a0 As if we're already gone.\n\nWhat happened in Japan is haunting as we feel next in line.\n\n[At OMSI](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/forces-of-nature-movie-review.html) we watched some places in Turkey in the danger zone, a film.\n\nIs this what they call \"escapism\"?\n\nIs it only an \"ism\" because it doesn't really work?\n\nOur zip code might shake a little less, being on the Mt. Tabor shield.\u00a0 The local martial arts studio has already reinforced.\u00a0 People take training classes, watch movies of their impending doom.\n\nLife is sweeter in that light, which no doubt accounts for some of the atmosphere.",
