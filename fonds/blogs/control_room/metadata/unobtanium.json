Unobtanium.\u00a0\n\nHe at one time had large amounts, cite Lattice Gallery.\u00a0 Designed in the Silicon Forest, Made in China.\u00a0\n\nBut \"the west\" (if we want to call it that) proved uninterested.  No time.  No space. Other priorities.\u00a0\n\nSo now a lot of it is gone for good, as Sam was not about to shoulder the storage costs all by his lonesome.",
