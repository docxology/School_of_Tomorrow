  "content": "This was a case where I was at a cineplex in a time slot, quickly scanning summaries to find something starting within 15-30 minutes.\u00a0 That narrowed my options considerably.\u00a0 I went with Out of the Furnace because of the big names, like Christian Bale and Willem DaFoe (I consider myself a fan of both).\n\nChristian plays the antithesis of the American Psycho guy.\u00a0 He cares little for appearance (except he's handsome) and is not proud or loud.\u00a0 He's pretty much your Bruce Springsteen all American, somewhere close to New Jersey.\u00a0 But by now that's so retro / ethnic is to make it like National Geographic and Bridges of Madison County.\n\nIt's not that kind of love story (Bridges...) though, it's grim and violent.\u00a0 There's the more twisted younger brother, the one who ends up in Iraq, tour after tour and gets more and more bent out of shape.\u00a0 He's explosive and that sets it off in others.\u00a0 The world is too dangerous for the likes of young Rodney, who has already paid too high a price.\n\nGiven I'm an older man now, I practiced projecting on the old guy side kick as my avatar in the ring.\u00a0 You know how when you go to movies you pick a person...\u00a0 I shouldn't say that as if novels weren't offering the same thing.\u00a0 Any fiction.\u00a0 Any history as a subset of fiction.\u00a0 Fact is the fiction most agreed upon?\u00a0 I ramble.\n\nThe bad guy in this movie has aroused our ire right from the opening scene, where he behaves like an out of control bully.\u00a0 One wishes for Bruce Lee to jump out of the big screen and deal with him right then and there, but this is not a martial arts film.",
