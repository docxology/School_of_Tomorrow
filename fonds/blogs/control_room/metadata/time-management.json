A former image.\n\nHere in [Asylum District](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/intraquaker-dialog-9ac6102e2b1c) I talk to a leading expert in concurrency.\u00a0 [Synchronous parallelism](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/07/parallel-processing.html) with multiple CPU cores is distinct from letting a coroutine sit on the shelf in pause mode, because it has no new work.\u00a0 A lot of your bureaucracy consists of people waiting for results, and not pressing the matter, because already working with earlier requests.\n\nCase in point:\u00a0 I'm heading down to county elections this afternoon, on behalf of my mom.\u00a0 We stopped by in mid September to make sure her ballot would come here and not go to California.\u00a0 It went to California.\n\nIf they try to mail another one today, it will also go to California.\u00a0 No one in the bureaucracy has gotten that far in the queue.\u00a0 The request is on file, but there's nothing immediate about updating the main database.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/31782492378/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nI was trying to strike up a conversation with other businesses on social media about whether gambling for charity is still gambling.\u00a0 I see these restrictions against gambling over the wire, but in these games, the winnings go to the charity of your choice, and you get to be the one with a hero's profile.\n\nPeople will commit to your potential winnings on the basis of your wise use (in their eyes) of their commitments.\u00a0 I've spelled out all the plans and protected them for the public, in [this sister blog](https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2018/10/the-economics-and-psychology-of.html).\n\nSpeaking of being a hero, I understand how people [use the I Ching](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/03/unicode-experiments.html) as a mnemonic device.\u00a0 There's a pattern language to the hero's journey, and in being willing to have the I Ching be [the labyrinth](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/ppug-20081014.html), one gets a well trodden, spelled out adventure.\n\nWelcome to LARP.\u00a0 Live Action Role Playing.\u00a0 Your life. What's wrong with feeding your inner hero?\u00a0 Isn't that what psychologists say to do?\u00a0 Lets be consistent.\n\nThe empiricists and frequentists cry foul, saying it's \"superstitious\" or \"magical\" thinking to consult the I Ching or look at Tarot decks or whatever.\u00a0 They're not thinking of how reinforcing a Memory Palace using the events of one's day is simply taking up the raw material of everyday living and applying that as a kind of glue language, to something worth holding together (a model).\u00a0 \n\nHaving a Memory Palace is not in itself a bad idea.\n\nSo what if a random billboard reminds you of one of its many rooms?\u00a0 Would you rather just obey the billboard?\u00a0 Some would prefer that you would.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30716657927/in/dateposted-public/)",
