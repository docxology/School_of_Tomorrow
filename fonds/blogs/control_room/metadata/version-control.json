That was a rogue operation run by secretive operatives who just assumed the USA would be appreciative of their covert efforts.\u00a0 That's no more than an assumption, then or now.\n\nWho gets to decide when Uncle Sam is culpable?\u00a0 Are we talking about in a democracy or what?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat if you're aware of a narrative wherein the USA might be considered bankrupt already, with a Medal of Freedom winner backing up that account.\u00a0 Not newly bankrupt, but since the 1980s, and not just financially, but morally.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn what sense might we blame Uncle Sam, if Uncle Sam is in fact dead and gone?\n\nBut even without such a radical-sounding story, it's still permissible to ask the question:\u00a0 where do we draw the line?\n\nA lot of us think the destruction of the Nord Stream pipeline was so outside the rules, that no state actor could possibly have been involved by definition.\u00a0 Such acts are just too beyond the pale.\u00a0 Nation states are not infinitely malleable.\n\nThe same logic might be applied to 911:\u00a0 whoever was in on it, the USG was not, by definition, because said act was too unconstitutional to be laid at the door of the USA.\u00a0 911 was a job by outsiders (perhaps posing as insiders?).\n\nIt's more honest to say \"the USA is dead and gone\" (we knew that) than to say it was responsible for some desperate act of sabotage (feeling cornered are we?) such that we must now engage in some form of coverup.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhy?\u00a0 Why is your USA that weak?\u00a0 Mine isn't.\n\nIn my story line the USA is (a) innocent of wrongdoing and (b) actively pursuing the perpetrators, in part by making their cover stories ever less believable, ever more paper thin, to the point of transparent. \n\nAs of today, I could easily go with the Seymour Hersh version of what happened, minus the assumption that \"we the people\" (our government) have to consider ourselves an accomplice.\u00a0 Was Hersh himself in on the plan?\u00a0 No?\u00a0 So why say \"we\"?\n\nOn the contrary, my USA is apparently working closely with Seymour Hersh, and this wouldn't be the first time.\n\nThink how little kids play with dolls.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJanet says our dolly just blew up Nord Stream.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs long as it's our dolly too (and we say it is), we maybe won't feel compelled to go along with Janet's proposal.\u00a0 Her story is not necessarily more credible than ours.\n\n\"Our dolly did no such thing\" is our side of it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt all comes down to which side gets to write the history books.\u00a0 Certainly my side has its version.",
