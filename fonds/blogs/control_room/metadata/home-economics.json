  "content": "A pattern for me, when thinking about concurrency, is to gravitate to cooking in a large well-equipped kitchen with multiple chefs.\u00a0 I should [thank Dave DiNucci](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/08/concurrency-again.html) for connecting these dots for us at a Wanderers presentation.\n\nI folded laundry while watching the \"[wicked smart](https://youtu.be/hIdsjNGCGz4)\" CBS Evening News (alluding to the last story about seeking the authentic Boston accent).\u00a0 Meanwhile, I shouted to my dog downstairs that I'd be back down shortly (she gets lonely, and can't walk, let alone climb stairs).\u00a0 All multi-tasking.\u00a0 Reality runs in parallel even if we imagine \"now\" time slices in sequence, integrating the differences.\n\nThe Gathering of Western Young Friends was also influential, in developing my appreciation for an institutional kitchen.\u00a0 This group of Quaker-Pagans sought out remote retreat center camping facilities that would allow the customers to take over logistics in a big way.\n\nWe brought in our own supplies and orchestrated the meals.\u00a0 It helped that a few of us (not me so much) were serious foodies, the kind with their own knife rolls.\u00a0 Some had cooked professionally.\n\nFast forward to [Food Not Bombs](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/10/portlandia-skits.html).\u00a0 When one joins a food prep team as an anonymous stranger, with others on the team also unknown to one another, with the ingredients for that day also somewhat luck of the draw, then collaboration powers inevitably get developed (unless there's a breakdown).\u00a0 People have an ability to self-organize, given optimum conditions (e.g. the prospect of a healthy meal as a reward for task completion).\n\nI was able to book our Quaker meetinghouse on Stark Street for a year of such experiments.\u00a0 We pulled it off every Thursday.\u00a0 My house was a hub for bicycle trailers coming and going.\u00a0 We had some room for inventory, both at my house and in the meetinghouse basement (just a single box in the latter location).\u00a0 My blogs chronicle this chapter and suggests one's habits have a way of perpetuating themselves, have a kind of inertia of their own.\u00a0 Isn't that why we call them habits?\n\nThe most powerful habits are habits of mind, which may encounter the least resistance.\u00a0 Physical habits maybe change, but in thought we have freedom, including the freedom to get stuck in a rut.\u00a0 Learning to get free of thoughts that comprise a mental prison more than a path to liberation is a life-long challenge.\n\nWe need fast reflexes to get by.\u00a0 Habits of thought are not in and of themselves \"bad\" so much as \"potentially worth countering\" -- usually with [other habits](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/cooking-show.html).\u00a0 We learn to consciously cultivate new habits as a way of dampening obsolete ones.\n\nIn team sports, coaches strive to impart the habits associated with team work.\u00a0 In my [essay on Home Economics](http://bit.ly/1O5VpoB) for MathFuture, I stress the similarities between athleticism and multi-tasking with others in a well-equipped kitchen.\u00a0 Sailing a boat likewise requires working as a crew.\n\nEvery successful enterprise needs team players with an ability to work together, developed over time through practice.\u00a0 Home Economics, as much as any team sport, might become a basis for infusing these skills more widely through what we call school.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/24358385386/in/dateposted-public/)",
