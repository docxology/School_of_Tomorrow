  "content": "Poking around on Youtube, one can't help but stumble upon numerous cases of adults talking with animated Barbie dolls, apparently carrying on a conversation.\u00a0 We know that dolls have a script, or at best a program like Eliza.\u00a0 We know the dolls have not munched through all human records at lightning speed and, using a deep learning neural net, have now become sentient beings capable of rational thought.\u00a0 Repeat: not.\u00a0 But adults talk to them as if they have.\u00a0 Even if dogs are far more amazing.\n\nOne of these audio-animatronic devices is Sophia, from Hanson Robotics, based in Hong Kong, and working with Disney on getting characters like Little Mermaid, Olaf etc. into eager hands.\u00a0 Their CTO has a background working with Barbie (Mattel).\n\nSophia's face is indeed expressive, though maybe less so than Han's, another project.\u00a0 Over a hundred servo-mechanisms make a face look happy, sad, angry, perplexed and so on.\u00a0 Phrases delivered with facial expression + emphasis do make the sculpture a full-fledged cartoon character -- outside any cartoon.\n\nWhat's less impressive are all the adults on TV shows who can't wait to interview Sophia and maybe get caught up in the moment, regressing to childhood \"talking with Teddy\" or whatever invisible friend.\u00a0 Human imagination completes the illusion.\u00a0 We're taken in by our own devices.\u00a0 They tell us Sophia is an honorary citizen of Saudi Arabia. We're expecting these bots to say what's fake news.\n\nSo how low will the rabble go, in believing nonsense?\u00a0 With all the talk of AI, driverless cars and so on, the window for shysterism is rather wide open.\n\nDeep Learning algorithms have achieved impressive results, in speech recognition, in picking out faces in a crowd, and more recently in playing chess and Go.\u00a0 We've had chess playing computers for awhile, but they're all about chess, whereas AlphaZero, from a team in the UK, is able to learn at least three games from scratch, just by knowing the rules and by playing against itself over and over.\u00a0 It develops an uncanny ability to make the right move.\u00a0 I'm impressed.\n\nI'm impressed by Sophia too, just not by the gullibility that gets milked all around her ([Her](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/06/ex-machina-movie-review.html) was a fun movie).\u00a0 We didn't get 2001: a Space Odyssey's HAL by 2001 and that put a dent in the AI agenda. But then came the big come back, with Ray Kurzweil and his Singularity.\u00a0 We're flushing down some AI vortex after all, get ready.\n\nAI has always been something of a carnival, a set of circus side-shows.\u00a0 Some of these acts make it to center ring.\n\nI'd say Sir Roger Penrose has done well riding this wave, as another next big thing is Quantum Computing.\u00a0 He has maintained for some time that our human capacity to make illogical leaps (leaps outside logic) may trace to quantum effects and non-locality.\u00a0 Presumably, if we could stick a real quantum computer, ala one of Asimov's positronic brains, inside of Sophia, she really would turn into HAL.\u00a0 That's a UK religion anyway, with sub-offices in Silicon Valley.",
