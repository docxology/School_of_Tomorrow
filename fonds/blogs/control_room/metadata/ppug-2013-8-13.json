He has a fairly loud voice.\u00a0 He's delivering a good plug for really writing the documentation.\u00a0 The half-life of your project depends on it.\u00a0 \"Documentation builds a better community.\"\n\nEric's tool uses \"markdown\" (.md files).\u00a0 See [markdowntutorial](http://markdowntutorial.com/). \n\nI should go back to [my CP4E pages](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html) and document stuff more.\u00a0 I think I did pretty well at the time, like with [the Numeracy Series](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/numeracy0.html).\n\nGood documentation covers:\n(a) installation\n(b) provides a tutorial, maybe a cookbook (recipes)\n(c) links to code and issues, for providing feedback\n(d) any other ways to get support, community info\n(e) a license e.g. (BSD, GPL, MIT)\n(f) contributor information (if there's a way to get involved) \n\nNo license defaults to closed source, copyleft is explicit.\u00a0 This same message was drummed home at OSCON XV.\u00a0 At this rate we'll be done within a single hour.\u00a0 That's a fast PPUG meeting.\n\nNo wait, we'll have a Lightning Talk or two.\u00a0 That's a good idea.\n\nBy the time I got to Rogue, seats looked all taken so I let Steve have some fun while I went around the block for some food.\u00a0 I invited about twenty new people to my LinkedIn network to pass the time.",
