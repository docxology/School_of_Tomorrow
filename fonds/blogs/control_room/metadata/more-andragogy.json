  "content": "I've been \"watching\" the World Cup, sometimes actually watching, on HDTV at a sports bar, e.g. Jolly Roger, while waiting to help on a move of some archive, but other times only hearing, being at the wrong angle to view, but hearing the cheering, the sounds of an engaged audience.\u00a0 Such was the case at Horse Brass, where we sat around the corner from the TV (HD).\n\nI've been advising my students to kick back and watch it though.\u00a0 You'd think I'm self serving, just trying to have less work, but my view is programming requires some neural rewiring, or whatever model you like of \"mental work\", and that happens during sleep and off moments, not just when you're focused and concentrating.\u00a0 Those two moments go together, a dialectic:\u00a0 fierce concentration, followed by relaxed inattention, while you let the rest of your brain catch up, so to speak.\n\nBucky Fuller used Doppler Effect to mean something different:\u00a0 the fact that we're not all on the same page all of the time, nor need we be nor should we be.\u00a0 We roam around (wander) and find others on the same page, but not everyone, and sometimes only our own selves.\u00a0 It's that \"non-simultaneous only partially overlapping\" stuff he talked about incessantly.\u00a0 We get it in different orders, \"it\" being the thing we assemble from the puzzle pieces, per the constructivist view.\n\nI'm calling this [More Andragogy](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/wanderers-2009317.html) because it's pedagogy, familiar, but recapped for adults.\u00a0 You might be a child reading this, but your peer readers are likely older, given the demographic for writings of this type.\u00a0 I'm not thinking to be exclusionary and welcome child readers.\u00a0 Fairy tales are for adults as well, as the muppet-masters manifest.\u00a0 Inter-generational banter, message traffic, is the stuff of civilization, torch-passing and all that.\n\nToday was a jumble.\u00a0 We'd had a rule change at work awhile back, a consequence of growing towards new archetypes, as an academy, such that students were frantic to have finished X by today, a deadline.\u00a0 Carol, mom, needed some professional attention and with help from Carl's Jr. and nearby Oregon Clinic (closed), I was able to snarf the WiFi I needed to keep up with said frantic students, enjoying a milkshake at the same time.\u00a0 Carol's X-rays revealed nothing serious and we have follow-up care planned and covered.\u00a0 The system worked for us today.\u00a0 And yet: today was a jumble.\n\nI hear the back gate swinging open as my door to the back deck (upstairs) is open, Sarah-the-dog taking in the night air, meaning Lindsey must be returning, our extended house guest from Savannah, GA.\u00a0 She was introduced to me by Patrick, fellow mentor, with whom I just had a beer (not the first time).\u00a0 We're a neighborly bunch, in our partially overlapping scenarios, experiencing the Doppler Effect by weaving through one another's lives in Scenario Universe as Bucky called it (\"it\").",
