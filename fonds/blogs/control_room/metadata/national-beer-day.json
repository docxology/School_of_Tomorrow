Tabor.\n\nYes, Glenn wants to fire up more awareness of his Global Matrix meme and since he's all about global data displays, I thought:\u00a0 what better project for the Global Data Corporation (GDC), a meme I've been using since the 1980s at least?\n\nGDC was not incorporated using \"white man law\" (in the Federal jurisdiction).\u00a0 I guess we'd call it \"off shore\"?\u00a0 Anyway, I added [a new Github subfolder](https://github.com/4dsolutions/GDC) about it this morning, containing some buried PR for Glenn's initiative.\u00a0 Other PR is buried even more deeply.\n\nSpeaking of \"buried\", did you know the official word for where the urns are kept (containing ashes) is called a columbarium?\u00a0 That's funny.\u00a0 \"Bury 'em\" (an alternative way).\u00a0 Given my first name, Kirby, is sometimes translated as \"Kirk By\" i.e. \"By the Kirk\" as in Churchyard (\"Kierkegaard\"), I sometimes say \"Kirby means cemetery\".\u00a0 So then \"Urner\" sounds likewise funereal.\u00a0 But it isn't.\n\nMore fitting with \"Urner\" is URI, or \"universal resource index\".\u00a0 Some writers found that too pretentious or something and \"URL\" (as in \"Uncle URL\" \u2014 I had an Uncle Earl, married to Aunt Betty my grandma Margaret Reilley's husband) became more common.\u00a0 Either way. the World Wide Web was invented in Switzerland (CERN) where the Canton of Uri is.\u00a0 That's [where \"Urner\" comes from](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/whats-urner.html)\u00a0(Urner = person from Uri).\n\nSpeaking of Urner, Kirby, I'm a complete idiot sometimes.\u00a0 Like today I was preoccupied thinking about who knows what (not me) and wandered away from the cash back I'd requested at the supermarket.\u00a0 Those were the most expensive Diet Dr. Peppers I ever purchased. I also confessed on Facebook and publicly resolved to make it up by giving up beer for two weeks at least.\u00a0 $5 / pint x 8, plus it'll actually be good for me.\n\nReally, I don't need to drink beer, which mainly contributes to my stupidity and waistline both.\u00a0 An old theme in these blogs. I'd be better off savoring the memories.\u00a0 Yes, the IPAs are really great here, one should definitely try one or two \u2014 and I have, many times.",
