Alan keeps checking back on the projects he tracks, so long as he's able, updating his document database. Outcomes research is also essential.\n\nTurgid phone-book-sized reports are insufficient to get the info across, any museum curator could tell you that.\n\nGiven today's cyber-tools, a virtual museum is an affordable requirement, complete with oral histories, videos, and an inventory of flora and fauna and their migration patterns, and their roles in peoples lives.\u00a0 Alan thinks the Bonneville Power Administration made at least a decent attempt of building such an archive, before Celilo Falls went under, thanks to the Dalles dam.\n\nOne of Alan's favorite lessons revolves around a certain World Bank dam that was hastily retrofitted with a fish ladder that never worked, a last minute token attempt to compensate for the vast tonnage of edible protein that was about to be cut off, a fish migration cycle not fully appreciated. \n\nThe fish ladder never worked; it was built to the wrong scale for the migration in question.\u00a0 The dam is only able to produce about 40 megawatts of juice, and serves as an ongoing monument to the World Bank's ineptness, at least back then.\u00a0 \n\nHave things improved?\u00a0 Look for those on-line museums of \"before the project\" exhibits, with detailed information about the local lifestyles, food sources, patterns of trade.\u00a0 If you don't find any such exhibits, assume the answer is no, it's business as usual.\n\nI got [through Costco](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/another-day-in-matrix.html) for under $100, including the $1.50 hot dog + soda pop. \n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/26532538722/in/dateposted-public/)",
