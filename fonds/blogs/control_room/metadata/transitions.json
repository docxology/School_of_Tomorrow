  "content": "I huddled with parents of other prom goers.\u00a0 We snapped our cameras furiously, capturing these precious moments.\n\nI was happy to get to know these people better, even as we come to the end of a chapter. \n\nThen I drove to the pharmacy with only seconds to spare.\n\nIn my book it's not sinful to hate the suffering in this world.\u00a0 In this case, hate is a kind of furious fighting back.\u00a0\n\nA sword of compassion is a sword nonetheless.\n\nA scenario, or time tunnel, is both a tunnel of sorrows, and a tunnel of joys.\n\nMuch sadness and grieving is with us at all times.\n\nThere is no need to paper over this reality.\u00a0 Why waste energy in denial of what's real?\n\nJoys are real also.",
