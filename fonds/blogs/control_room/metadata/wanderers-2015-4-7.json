  "content": ":: paying myself $30 plus postage ::\n\nBarry is talking about needed reforms in the capital games tax, talking about day trading, after the capital gains period, eating your losses etc. etc..\u00a0 He's a retired banker, but those around the table aren't that as financially savvy necessarily.\n\nI think a state should expect commitment of time and energy in lieu of taxes or as a type of taxes.\u00a0 You get a job with the government where presumably there's value added as a result of your performance. \n\n[Barry](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/08/boat-back-in-action.html) doesn't like the corporate personhood movement, also known as Voodoo Economics whereby inanimate objects (corpses, corporations) gain personhood (souls).\u00a0 It's a kind of legal fiction, or science fiction that's serious enough to govern role playing in some subcultures.\n\nA government [could run hotels](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html), rental car depots, a bunch of tourist related stuff.\u00a0 It does so now, in the guise of its military, but what about civilian bases, more like Disneyland than Mordor?\u00a0 There's no shortage of stuff for people to do, as committing some percent of their aliveness to serving the greater good.\n\nThe so-called 1% would stereotypically want to exempt itself from [government service](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/broad-brush-strokes.html) as they're wanting to party in penthouses and not maintain mountain trails.\u00a0 Not everyone is equally able.\u00a0 One could have a monetary way of playing the taxes game, but also this other way, like joining the military but the civilian correlate.\n\nAt one point I was suggesting Girl Scouts as the model, with abandoned bases in the Philippines as my backdrop.\u00a0 I'd been to Clark AB pre Pinatubo so knew how a base might double as a civilian campus, or be converted into one, more like a university, less like a prison.\u00a0 War is unfreedom to the max.\n\nChristine is asking questions, as Barry continues talking about stocks and IPOs.\u00a0 Insiders can't sell their shares right away.\n\nWhen people give to charity they get credit sometimes.\u00a0 Their profile is updated.\u00a0 However the government takes the glory for how taxes are spent.\u00a0 Were individual role playing the currency, bleeping over the importance of individuals would be harder.\u00a0 People complain USAers are \"too individualistic\".\u00a0 Maybe that really is not the problem.\n\nYou want to be a star, a celebrity, and how do your taxes help you achieve that?\u00a0 Does the government give you fifteen minutes of fame?\u00a0 Are you able to make movies?\u00a0 In some cases yes, taxes get used for that.\u00a0 But how many filmmakers get to serve the greater good as their way of pulling their weight?\u00a0 Don't we waste talent by not letting them?\n\nSome from the art side struck up a side conversation on [Zombie Jesus](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Zombie_Jesus), another circulating comic meme.\u00a0 Warning:\u00a0 not everyone has a sense of humor where Jesus is concerned.\u00a0 More of [a Gnostic thing](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/01/some-comparitive-religion.html) maybe?",
