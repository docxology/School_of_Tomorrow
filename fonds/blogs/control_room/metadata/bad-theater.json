Clearly this plan was up some sleeve, funded by petrodollars. Some triggering event would be needed.\n\nThe charade at the UN was the thinnest yet.\u00a0 The UK and US role players read from their same script, per usual.\u00a0 The diplomatic gestures were pro forma. The attack was already getting a green light from somewhere.\n\nI don't think anyone serious will be talking about North Korea, really a non-issue in comparison.\n\nNo one wants to hear how the Unabomber \"feels threatened\" as it suffers yet another psychotic breakdown.\n\nTrump's base appears to be fracking over his sudden course reversal, which he wants us to see as evidence of \"flexibility\".\u00a0 Is that it, or did some straw just break the back of some camel?\n\n[Unabomber City](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/08/city-of-morons.html) is feeling desperate and weak, its grip on power slipping away.\u00a0 Will this rerun of the attack on Iraq help rally the people?\u00a0 I doubt it.\u00a0 But then many livelihoods depend on keeping these wars going.\n\nAddressing domestic issues just looks too scary I guess, especially to the chicken hawks.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/33857592856/in/dateposted-public/)",
