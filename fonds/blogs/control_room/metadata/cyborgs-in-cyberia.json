  "content": "The realm of true facts (truths), whatever they are, under determines our moral and ethical response thereto, meaning objective facts are insufficient to provide an existential framework.\u00a0We have to supply the interpretation, which is where free will enters the picture i.e. subjectivity, such as there is any.\u00a0Objectively speaking, most thoughts and emotions arise just as mechanically as any other programmed phenomenon.\u00a0Humans should not be afraid of being cyborgs. For the most part, that's what we are. And we're reprogrammable, our saving grace though perhaps insufficient, especially if we have no faith in it i.e. if we deny intuition.",
