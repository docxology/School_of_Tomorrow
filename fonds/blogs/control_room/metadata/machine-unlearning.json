  "content": "Is tagging by race for ML purposes itself a racist practice, by definition?\u00a0 ML = machine learning if you didn't know.\u00a0 In my subculture, that's a given.\u00a0 ML has taken off in recent years, refueling the dream of RI (real intelligence) ultimately emerging from AI (artificial, phony or mock intelligence).\n\nI'd say in the neural nets of real humans, tagging by race was caught up in self fulfilling prophesy (or poetry -- Paine) of a religious nature, regarding the \"place of each race\" in some cosmological caste system. Without mechanized agriculture or quarrying, the vast resources had been commanded under threat of a whip in many cases.\u00a0 Cosmologies (background programs) needed to support that status quo.\n\nPer the book Caste, India's social engineers and Jim Crow have a lot to talk about, in terms of comparing notes.\u00a0 May the civil rights movement in India continue on an enlightening path.\u00a0 Obsolete stereotyping is the root of almost all evil (falling behind), whereas sensitive discernment of relevant traits is by definition not obsolete.\u00a0 The advantage is in having the right models.\n\nThe Tower of Babel  was the anchor for many civil warriors, up to the \"confusion in tongues\" part, which people tended to misinterpret from their bully pulpits.\u00a0 God used extra- and/or epigenetic (outside chromosomal) reprogramming techniques to fix a major bug of the Noah Era.\u00a0 The bottleneck of Noah's Arc had given rise to groupthink and monoculture, and to an idiocracy expecting its reward in heaven based on some taller-is-better ideology-architecture.\u00a0 God again saw a need to intervene. Humans were still in fine tuning phase in the Book of Genesis.\n\nThinking in language runs \"a miracle a minute\" compared to the miraculous mutant-based morphing associated with geological time DNA coding -- unless you're a bacterium or other such simple-tiny self propagator.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHumans were split asunder not along genetic lines, but into their philological flows, which helped create the impetus, the mutually frustrating pressure, to wander far afield and start fresh, creating new versions of everything:\u00a0 New York, Nova Scotia, New South Wales...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe student body diaspora would eventually spread around the world and finally get that the campus was spherical.\u00a0 A self conscious humanity would become a university of the meek, humble in its obvious ignorance.\u00a0 Score one for God then.\u00a0 The jealous angels could not say \"I told you so\" that quickly.\n\nThe whole US Civil War mentality started falling apart with the continued evolution of mechanized sea, bus, rail, and air travel.\u00a0 Spaceship Earth became a nomad land, as its next generations of people, with their light-to-dark sun-blocking skin tones, resettled the Americas.\u00a0\n\nThe newer neural nets started coping with \"world around\" tourism, with some traveling themselves, others staying put. Either way, people coped with a shocking future, and continuing waves of migration.\n\nThe race tag was proving less and less a predictor of whether that stranger sitting next to you was conversant with quantum physics, knew English, had a gun.\u00a0 Hard to know.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe race-based language games were about making things simple, a truly uphill battle where human complexity is concerned.\n\nThe corollary to ML models drifting off course, perhaps thanks to \"foundations of sand\" tagging schemes built around race, is the emergence of tagging looking at authentic ethnic attributes (e.g. philological) versus these pseudo-biological ones.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNothing in biology precisely maps to the old civil warrior \"races\" idea because the race concept was forged in the wake of reading Genesis, not in the study of genetics. \"Critical race theory\" has morphed into \"critical of race\" theory.\n\nIn the evolutionary marketplace of ideas (extra-genetic in large degree, unless you're deliberately inbreeding some royal dead end) race-based ML is going to suffer the slings and arrows of strongly countering intelligence services.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTheir PR will be along the lines of \"only the slow think in terms of race\" which is condescending I realize.\u00a0 Condescension is more effective when disguised.\u00a0 Lets call it \"mock pity for those who believe in breeding a master race\" i.e. \"too bad y'all will never be ruling class, not with crazy beliefs like that\".",
