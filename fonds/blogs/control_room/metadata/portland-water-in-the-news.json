  "content": "Properly disinfecting surface water sources kills E. Coli:\n\nSystems using [surface water](http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-education2/8-surface-water-quality.htm),\n rather than ground water, are required to take extra steps to protect \nagainst bacterial contamination because surface water sources are more \nvulnerable to such contamination.\u00a0At a minimum, all systems using \nsurface waters must disinfect.\u00a0Disinfection will kill E. coli O157:H7.\u00a0 [[source](http://www.g3e-ewag.ca/programs/Puits/underground_water.html)]\nSo should Portland blame its reservoirs or the lack of sufficient treatment? \n\nContractors are in place to disconnect our hundred year old system, [not because it's broken](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/04/empty-theatrics.html), but because the EPA says we have to.\n\nDo underground, versus surface sources, also contain E. Coli sometimes?\u00a0 [Yes](http://www.g3e-ewag.ca/programs/Puits/underground_water.html).\n\nGiven E. Coli has nothing to do with why the EPA wants this system shut down, we at least have a litmus test: \u00a0any politician using the E. Coli scare to make points for closing is willfully clueless and a self identified lackey for the contractors / businesses standing to gain financially from the EPA's one-size-fits all ruling.",
