understanding the risks to our security presented by this Internet of Things.\n\nAs the CEO of Mentor Graphics, Wally is at the helm of one of the few companies the makes the tools that make tools that make the chips those Things contain.\u00a0 Chips as in \"micro-miniaturized circuit boards\" designed to perform reliably and in a trustworthy manner.\n\nWhat one industry sees as an [embarrassing vulnerability](http://www.extremetech.com/computing/216694-western-digital-to-buy-sandisk-experts-eviscerate-wds-encrypted-hard-drives), another will see as an exploitable hack.\n\nThe black hats challenge the white hats to do their jobs correctly, by breaking into their stuff in ways that should and could be prevented.\u00a0\u00a0 The black hats are making a point:\u00a0 you need to stay on top of your game.\n\nWhen only white hats abound, some will need to don black just to keep the skill sets up to snuff, the reflexes fresh, much as a human body will do when training to [remember past insults](http://www.vaccines.gov/more_info/work/).\u00a0 Memories get built.\n\nAnti-virus software tends to be a huge database of [signature byte strings](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/30362/how-do-antiviruses-scan-for-thousands-of-malware-signatures-in-a-short-time).\n\nWally started his talk pointing out that humans owned an ever smaller percentage of IP numbers in that most of them belong not on \"whois\" people but \"whatis\" things (one could say).\n\nYou don't need to register as a \"who\" to be a toaster or refrigerator in somebody's household.\u00a0 IPv6 gives us plenty of addresses to spread Things around.\n\nHow are chips signed?\u00a0 Do we want them signed?\u00a0 What would the signature mean?\n\nWe're only beginning to answer these questions.\u00a0 CEOs yak about these topics a lot.\u00a0 Wally is on the road quite a bit, sharing these and other, more technical, slides.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/25665642266/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nThe overall schema is an inverted pyramid in that the most widespread exploits involve various forms of social engineering, trickery around phishing and phoning in with false identities, milling about in smoking areas and befriending employees.\n\nThese kinds of security breaches may get wide publicity but affect fewer individuals than mega-downloads of supposedly confidential info.\u00a0 Sometimes social engineering leads to deeper exploits.\n\nIn one experiment, USB sticks were scattered in the parking lot, apparently dropped by mistake.\u00a0 How many finders-keepers types would insert these sticks in their own machines?\u00a0 Depressingly many.\n\nGet yourself a quarantined box you're prepared to let fry, if you're wanting to do hobby forensics.\u00a0 Sure, random memory sticks might have interesting content but that doesn't mean accepting candy from strangers is suddenly a good idea.\n\nMass downloading exploits, as have been successfully conducted against Anthem Healthcare and the IRS (I've got files with both, so I'm a victim), may rely on security holes in the infrastructure itself, at the base of which are these all-important chips, signed and unsigned.\n\nWhat if [the chip itself](http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/225524-apple-may-design-its-own-servers-to-avoid-government-snooping) is doing surveillance tasks supposedly for customer maintenance and satisfaction but with the side effect of providing a side door into private circuits?\u00a0 What if the chip itself is hackable?\u00a0 These kinds of vulnerability may be the hardest to find and yet affect the most people in the long run.\n\nHow might a customer verify that a purchased chip does just what the documentation says it does, and no more?\n\nFor example the Apple iPhone is currently vulnerable at least in principle but the Apple CEO is working overtime to close that gap.\n\nPretty soon, what the FBI is asking for will not be engineeringly feasible, whereas today one could enslave people to force the opening. \n\nA safe is meant to be safe and many designs for software safes are in principle, mathematically, uncrackable, unless of course one gets very lucky with some wild guess, less likely than winning the lottery three times in a row.\n\nOnce the paper is out of the safe there's no guarantee it's still valuable.\u00a0 Securities are more vulnerable to shifting markets that crackable safes.\n\nI took a ceremonial US Bank check from Dawn Wicca and Associates to commemorate Dawn's years as a bookkeeper for ISEPP, during a golden age.\u00a0 She died on St. Patrick's Day on 2007, and I'm thinking about her quite a bit.\n\nSome of the donation was actually paying for a signed copy of Terry's new book, which I'm taking to Quaker Men's Group as worship-reading (also known as slow reading).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/25573126892/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nI was allowed to bring a guess and offered seats at the Heathman Dinner to a couple people, neither of whom could make it that \nnight (Patrick joined me for the talk itself).\u00a0 I had a great time anyway.\n\nGlenn has been working on his [\"elevator speech\" for Global Matrix](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/03/the-global-matrix.html) and tried it out on Wally, who's eye was drawn to the NSA crypto-analyst line towards the end.\n\nClearly Glenn was familiar with white and black hat territory.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/25061297084/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nI think I'd already left the scene by then, somewhat ironically sporting the black Stetson that Glenn gave me.\u00a0 I'd actually gone back to the car for it during Q&A, because I'd forgotten my bank check also.\u00a0 I moved the car closer to the venue.\n\nQ&A was still going on when I got back.\u00a0 Wally was generous with his time.\u00a0 He appreciates these golden opportunities to engage the general public.\n\nI'm more of a social engineering hacker than a hardware guy I'd say, and I'm more the kind to leave bread crumbs, make it a treasure hunt, like with geo-caching, perhaps with product placement worked in. \n\nSure, there are times I'd like to have been a fly on a wall, but I understand about authorized access and tend to steer clear of areas restricted against my kind.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/25347142720/in/dateposted-public/)",
