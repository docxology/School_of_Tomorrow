  "content": "I've been an avid Apes (Planet of the) since the first one, with [Charlton Heston](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb4eZ7Z5yk8) and [Roddy McDowall](http://planetoftheapes.wikia.com/wiki/Roddy_McDowall). I've even been known to read the books.\n\nThis newest addition to the franchise is excellent in that it continues to give the apes real personalities, no less than it gives them to humans. \u00a0The camera / observer is perhaps an angel from another planet in the sense of its sympathies going both ways.\n\nThe movie might be construed as pacifist in its message, even while the inevitability of war is its subject. \u00a0Fear and jealousy drive both sides and the lesser characters, the non-heroic, are the first to succumb. \u00a0They spread the seeds of war to others, including through treachery. \u00a0An old pattern. \u00a0The analogy of the physical virus with the mental one is crystal clear.\n\nThe facial expressions of anger, giving vent to the inner demon, stir in both human and ape alike, a first symptom of the infection. \u00a0I'm thinking of [Tich Nhat Hanh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJ9UtuWfs3U) and his challenge to followers to foreswear anger. \u00a0One might imagine this movie on his syllabus.\n\nThe choreography and computer graphics (visual effects) are spectacular.\n\nFlavors of 12 Monkeys, Jurassic Park, Cabin in the Woods and several others, which isn't to say anything pejorative, on the contrary.\n\nThat the movie was brave enough to use subtitles is a big point in its favor. \u00a0The movie takes itself seriously enough to make real soul searching possible. \u00a0There's not much gratuitous levity. \u00a0The situation is dire.",
