[2] \n\nThis model leads to an analogous \ntreatment of 3rd powering (or multiplying any 3 numbers) that goes to a \ntetrahedron, not a cube.\u00a0 \"Three to the third power\" is not a cube but a\n tetrahedron.\u00a0 This is well known from the 1970s writings of geodesic \ndome architect Buckminster Fuller. [3]\n\nGiven the \npronounced 4ness of the tetrahedron (4 windows, 4 points), and no \ndistinction in dimension twixt points, lines and planes (\"infinitely \nthin or small\" e.g. \"depth without height or width\" are handled by a \nconcept of \"subfrequency\" instead), we get a \"pre-frequency\" Platonic \nworld that is considered \"4D\" (tetrahedron = concept of \"container\" i.e.\n that with inside/outside concave/convex aspects), with Time / Energy \nadded as additional dimensions. [4]\n\nThat's all an opening into a philosophical investigation of what's permissible, in \nterms of having different namespaces.\u00a0 Are these moves \"allowed\"?\u00a0 It's a\ndifferent way of talking.\u00a0 I cast it as \"Martian Math\" to acknowledge \nit's alien, but not necessarily \"wrong\".\n\nChallenging the efficacy \nand utility of Euclidean geometry is not the point.\u00a0 Pointing to \nanother way of connecting the dots that likewise holds water is the\n point.\u00a0 One needs a limber mind to tackle slippery concepts (like \n\"dimension\") and getting too stuck in a rut is not a good way to stay \nlimber.\n\nKirby\n\n[1] in Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist , The Library of Living Philosophers VII, edited by P.
