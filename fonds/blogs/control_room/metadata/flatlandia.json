  "content": "ET: Wow that sounds ambitious and like the architecture of some computer game, with levels, as we progress up the dimension ladder.\n\nYour beginning seems influenced (in the poetic sense, cite Harold Bloom) by Edwin Abbott\u2019s Flatland, a classic piece of satire, not a math book at all, but relied upon heavily by popularizers of what became Hilbert Space retrospectively i.e. the n-dimensional playground sandbox of ML and AI.\n\nYou follow the textbook grooves pretty closely through point, line, square, and cube but then veer off in going from cube to sphere, as in conventional university maths there\u2019s no change in dimension when a cube morphs like that into a bowling ball i.e. the introduction of curvature doesn\u2019t add a new dimension.\u00a0\n\nThe door to higher dimensions in Hilbert Space is through adding more and more orthogonals, with the caveat being: you get to confess visualization becomes difficult beyond the first three. But some high priests and gifted amateur mystics are able to witness said Hypercross, the Holy Tesseract.\u00a0\n\nYes, the math goes kinda culty in this \u2018hood, in terms of jargon, but in terms of analogy and metaphor it works well, as \u201cEuclidean distance\u201d keeps being meaningful no matter how many dimensions are involved, as does the notion of address adjacency.\u00a0\n\nN-dimensional sphere packing comes with an elegant algebra.\u00a0\n\nThose at home in Hilbert Space tend to do well economically. The metaphysical heritage of the British Empire. Except it\u2019s French and German just as deeply. XYZ coordinates are quasi-universal, as is the scholastic consensus that \u201cspace is 3D\u201d. Few ever fight City Hall on that one (Bucky an outlier for sure, and perhaps the best known of such mavericks).\n\nFlatland concerns itself mainly with a sphere talking down to a circle as I recall. The circle gets a headache trying to imagine the space the sphere is in, whereas we readers consider the sphere\u2019s space our home stomping ground \u2014 we have the opposite problem: imagining ourselves in an entirely flat world. Is this possible? I\u2019ll admit it\u2019s a challenge as the tendency is to \u201clook down\u201d on some squares-ville meaning we\u2019re still in god\u2019s eye mode and haven\u2019t yet lost the 3rd dimension. Try again?\n\nThis little comic book has to be one of the most influential tracts ever published, right up there with the theses of Martin Luther.\n\nI\u2019m intrigued by your neutrality talk and in the background I\u2019m thinking of \u201cneutrality studies\u201d a branch of \u201cpeace studies\u201d which some colleges and universities have had a major in, although I don\u2019t believe the genre \u201cpeace college\u201d has anything to counter the well-established \u201cwar college\u201d trope. My storyboard \u201cschools for diplomats\u201d might qualify someday.\n\nI\u2019m saying I spontaneously connect your (|+.0.-|) neutrality talk to geopolitics, which I\u2019m somewhat geared into. When it comes to word2vec and inter-word hyper-distance, \u201cneutrality\u201d definitely haunts the world stage, in the sense of \u201cappears frequently\u201d.\n\nI\u2019ll be somewhat in the bleachers (innocent bystander, observer, spectator) vs-a-vs your starting over from scratch dimension ladder project, as I\u2019m already pre-committed to hammering out my own (inherited, extending a lineage).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m also interested in what you mean by \u201cpre point\u201d as we have our \u201cprefrequency\u201d notion in the 4D talk I espouse (4D being like a brand, a logo, me having registered 4Dsolutions.net as a domain name awhile ago).\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ll check in on your progress and see if I can make use of some of your PR. From my angle, all systems require spin and PR to have a half life. PR is akin to propaganda, that which propagates. In the old Catholic bureaucracy, which spoke Latin, there was nothing especially disreputable about the term. It only lost its neutrality, even positivity, when it became associated with the dastardly nefarious activities of that other guy, the baddie. I find English (the language) especially colored by \u201cgoodie vs baddie\u201d ideas, which extend to colorizing the mathematics e.g. negative secondary to positive, left secondary to right. They\u2019re imbalanced.",
