  "content": ":: PDX :: \n\nI'm back at Beaches in chauffeur mode, seeing Steve Holden off to the UK. \u00a0Rather recently, I was saying good bye to Lindsey, as she took off for Nepal. \u00a0We had some farewell beers, and food, in this same establishment, at the D, E gate end of the concourse.\n\nWe started up another Google Group today, for NPYM record-keepers. \u00a0Friends (\"Quakers\") are into record-keeping. \u00a0In order to cohere as a self-governing business, a Business Meeting needs (A) organizational memory and (B) structure.\n\nI've been making airplane reservations, hotel reservations, rental car reservations. \u00a0Everything is so convenient and there's no need to pick up a phone to ask some busy person to take real time out of their day. \u00a0The phone was too intrusive. \u00a0Asynch is the way to go. \u00a0Friends learned that early. \u00a0We put silence between our communications, as a matter of course.\n\nEven though the airport FlyPDX domain was not about to let me [download Anaconda](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/02/anaconda-fat-python-for-you.html), Steve had a way of getting it over to me (memory stick), so I took the opportunity to blow away Python 3.2 in favor of Anaconda's 3.4.\u00a0 That leaves me to face the music in PyCharm, which I expect will be easily reconfigurable.\n\nFollowup: turns out I hadn't really blown away 3.2 so PyCharm was unaffected. \n\n@ Beaches",
