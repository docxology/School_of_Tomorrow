  "content": "Good literature provides many doorways in and out, this movie no exception. \u00a0I'm not dismissing or dispatching a movie in \"reviewing\" it. \u00a0That doesn't mean \"always behind me\" as if there's no more this work has to teach. \u00a0I'm not saying that at all. \u00a0[Like Being There](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/being-there-movie-review.html), I keep going back to it. \u00a0Movies can haunt one.\n\nI've been a Halle Berry fan from the beginning, sort of [making fun of myself](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/about-habitats.html) in the process. \u00a0Tom Hanks, great actor. \u00a0These are contemporaries. \u00a0[Jane Fonda](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/06/our-week-in-indy.html) is part of it (no, she's not in this movie). \u00a0We shared a time. \u00a0These were celebs I grew up with.\n\nWhere I want to go with this movie is here: instead of spreading it way out in time, lets yak about \"from one day to the next\". \u00a0The masks stay the same to some degree but isn't it like \"another lifetime\" between chapters. \u00a0Your own life is like this movie, in having its \"same people\" but not quite.\n\nConnecting to an earlier viewing, same theater, days before: \u00a0karma is conservation of momentum. \u00a0In the namespace of this movie, we could add.\n\nThe preview was [about Lincoln](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/11/lincoln-movie-review.html), the upcoming Spielberg rendering. \u00a0I've been reading up on the Civil War on my own, not because I knew about this movie. \u00a0Meaning I was primed to see the theme of slavery in New Seoul. \u00a0Beyond slavery, to utter parisitism. \u00a0I've been studying intra-Quaker dialog around that time. \u00a0Abolitionists were known as \"immediatists\" and \"comer outers\". \u00a0The good old boy Quakers were more like \"we'll get around to it, it's not like you tell us what to do\". \u00a0Not that they owned slaves themselves by this time (they'd divested over a generation or two) but they didn't want to be seen as \"anti-gummint\" and \"the gummint\" was saying slaves was A O K.\n\nWhat keeps the movie watchable is it rewards on many levels, including with good humor. \u00a0There's a happy Hobbit House flavor to some of the comic interludes (\"It's People!\"). \u00a0The eye candy is good. \u00a0It occasionally hits a B-movie sweet spot that says \"yes I know I'm an illusion\" which for this audience works great.\n\nI stumbled out of the theater to a text message reminding me of a friendly gathering I could be at. \u00a0I was led to go and hopped off the 4 with a realistic plan. \u00a0But then my GPS system confused me by moving the dot in response to the entered house number, persuading me my original plan was bogus. \u00a0I hopped back on the 4 (another one) and, after a shopping-for-mom interlude, took the 14 to what in my imagination might be \"Fosterville\". \u00a0It wasn't, and the party was nowhere near. \u00a0I was in a dark neighborhood with no good excuse, but not a dangerous neighborhood, as really nobody cared.\n\nAnyway, back to the movie, this was proposed as a kick-off media event for a new Quaker group I'm attending. \u00a0Instead of all reading some book and yakking about it, we all watch a film or video. \u00a0But just as people may read alone or in small groups, so may we not all see the movie as a gaggle. \u00a0It's not like you'll see a whole posse of Quakers walking in to Seven Psychopaths. \u00a0That'd probably empty the theater as too strange. \u00a0Not that we'd all dress alike or anything...\n\nGreat epic science fiction, something I think the 1950s science fiction writers would have really appreciated, some of them still around. \u00a0Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Heinlein... that long list of pioneering contributors to graphic novels, comic books, full on prose, all in confluence with anime / manga in retrospect, with Japan suddenly a great hub for science fiction. \u00a0Korea too of course, not trying to play favorites too hard. \u00a0Earthians.\n\nI don't think the animals changed a lot over the span of this film. \u00a0The people had some, but they were pretty recognizable. \u00a0In H.G. Wells and other places the frame goes so far forward that we're dealing with a rather different cast of creatures. \u00a0That could be right here on Earth. \u00a0Like by the end of AI. \n\nTrue, the fabricants were the living sex dolls who maybe took over later? \u00a0I may have missed some things the book version explains. \u00a0That all these worlds tightly fit together was not so important to me that night, although I did notice the music house and the lock away house were the same building. \u00a0Some of the players had me fooled.\n\nThe guy on my left, probably older, was pulling out his cell phone and I was filled with annoyance. \u00a0Yes it's a 2 hour and 44 minute film. \u00a0That's long. \u00a0I think he was perplexed and using his phone for orientation. \u00a0Stern Quaker that I am, I thought about balling him out and pounding his cell phone under my heel but of course that's all meditative AVP imagery, as I had no intention of shifting my weight. \u00a0I simply got back to the story with Hale Berry and somewhat forgot he existed.",
