Mathematics would be a set of many such sub-languages, but so would be various shoptalks and philosophies that may contain maths, but aren't themselves purely maths.\n\nSynergetics is one such sub-class language, one of those philosophies that contains a geometric framework, namely said concentric hierarchy with a rhombic dodecahedron of volume six and so forth.\u00a0 The pretty picture.\n\nShould we teach a philosophy containing a pretty picture?\u00a0 Is that a question about moral imperatives?\u00a0 Is this an \"ought\" question?\n\nPerhaps it's more like a question to tour guides.\u00a0 We discover this abandoned old section of the museum and wonder if we should open it to the public.\n\nThe incentive to open might be to bring in more foot traffic, but what if that's not really a goal?\u00a0 One assumes a museum has a sense of self preservation, but \"museum\" might not be the right model.\n\nI suppose the counter-question is:\u00a0 what have we got to lose in teaching it, given it goes down smoothly for the most part and needn't take a huge amount of time?\u00a0 Why not swallow the pill, if it does no harm?\n\nThat's probably the question then.\u00a0 We're still trying to judge harm.\u00a0 Or is it that we've swallowed the pill already, and now are finding some of our practices coming under a different kind of scrutiny?\u00a0 The ordeal of morphing to adapt to the cosmos is not one Synergetics begets, so much as anticipates.\n\nI think if we'd swallowed the pill already, we'd see more symptoms, such as more Youtube clips featuring said concentric hierarchy.\u00a0 The evidence is more that a tiny subculture keeps the sub-language alive, like one of those native or indigenous languages on the verge of extinction.\n\nBe that as it may, the question remains:\u00a0 should the anthropology or sociology museum allow or encourage tourism in this area?\u00a0 Or maybe it's an art museum?\u00a0 Does the concentric hierarchy constitute art?\u00a0 We asked the same questions around Flextegrity.\u00a0 That Tensegrity is art, and widely excepted as such, is encouraging.\n\nI'm thinking Synergetics, and the pretty picture it contains, \"hangs by a thread\" and that thread is Tensegrity.\n\nGiven the art world has accepted the latter, there's a good chance it will accept the former, in due time.\u00a0 In fact we've seen signs of that already, in exhibits subsequent to the publication of Synergetics, including notably Lattice Gallery in Portland, Oregon, October - December on SE Broadway.\n\nBut also at the Whitney in New York, and the [Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art](https://flic.kr/p/6bm8SW) (2009).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/albums/72157616066135225)",
