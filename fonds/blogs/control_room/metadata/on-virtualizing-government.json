We have a long way to go when it comes to shelter. Share those simulations, those computer games. Help us see what you see.A president is someone to meet with foreign dignitaries and sit in on top level meetings, to interpret, for the American people, what the mega trends are, and to personalize it a little. Fireside chats was a good idea. Someone personable.The idea that a president is at the same time Captain of State, a Monarch, the Ruler, is one we must hope to stamp out in elementary school, as a pernicious myth circulated by would-be monarchists and other vaguely irrelevant schools of thought. A lot of immigrants come here with crazy ideas, especially from Britain and Europe.The missing ingredient is \"cybernetics\" i.e. \"self organization\" i.e. \"ouija board\". At first, kids are uncomfortable with idea that \"no one is in control\" as that sounds like anarchy. But just remind them, Spaceship Earth was a disciplined and smoothly running operation LONG before humans got here. Take comfort.
