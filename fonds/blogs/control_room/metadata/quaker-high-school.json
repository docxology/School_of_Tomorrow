  "content": ":: Advice to Teachers ::\nI did another walk through of my slides.\u00a0 I'm finally starting to use the Youtube feature that lets one embed hyperlinks to other videos, within the video.\u00a0\u00a0When I talk about Ezra Pound, I like to Graphing the Poets.\u00a0\u00a0When I mention Sam Hill, I link to Sam Hill's Quaker Legacy.My Synergetics talks are about Bucky Fuller's Synergetics, not this other Springer-Verlag Synergetics that the Russians are always writing about.\u00a0 Fortunately, Wikipedia does a good job of disambiguating.I entitled this post \"Quaker High School\" because, speaking as a curriculum writer, in my estimation there's simply no excuse for bleeping over the Bucky stuff, especially given it's had over forty years to mature (Synergetics was published in 1979, Synergetics 2 two years later).\u00a0\u00a0It's plenty mature now, and highly teachable.\u00a0 All IVM tetrahedrons have whole number tetravolume, nice.Ever since Fuller died in 1983, which I learned about on my way to a Friends General Conference, I've connected him to Friends (I wrote an obit in the FGC daily newsletter).\u00a0\u00a0However, in terms of content, we're talking everyday cultural literacy, as you'll see if you watch the video.If you feel somewhat comfortable with the content already, as many of my readers already do, I recommend playback at double speed.\u00a0\u00a0I'm speaking slowly enough that the sped up version isn't incomprehensible, assuming a practiced ear for American English (Amerish).You'll find in the Youtube notes that I catch myself regarding M.C. Escher's citizenship. He was Dutch. The Canadian connection is through his eldest son.",
