We'd expect to find a specimen of zircon thereon, along with beryl, emerald and some others.\n\nDon't expect me to name all twelve, though if you dig you might find something more like a complete listing in the slides.\u00a0 Steve does a lot of homework to create these talks.\n\nI left around the same time as Jon Bunce, off to Powell's for said biology book.\u00a0 Boot camp continues, with a five mile hike, including steep inclines, bruised ankles be damned.\n\nThe impromptu meetup with Dr. DiNucci at Common Ground was apropos, as concurrency concepts,\u00a0 taught through cooking in groups (as with Food Not Bombs) is topical within my code school network.\u00a0 Aside from a Horse Brass half order of Fish 'n Chips, I'm mostly subsisting on Soylent today (version 1.5).\n\nThe documentary on Puerto Rico looks interesting (rented from Movie Madness).\u00a0 We don't see many code schools there yet.\n\nBack at my workspace, I made sure [VPython](http://vpython.org/) is still working.\u00a0 Given the dependency on wxPython, I need to use Python 2.7, and a \"Framework\" 2.7 at that (to provide access to the main display).\u00a0 So far so good.\u00a0 Things are coming together.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/25533973174/in/dateposted-public/)",
