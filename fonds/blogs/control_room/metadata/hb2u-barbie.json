Passed to me from inside Mattel, the toy company, with an August 12, 1997 time stamp. \"TAR\" stands for Tibet Autonomous RegionPalast adds:  Please friends, note the humor.Anyway, the marketing department is very wrong about [the DL](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/10-questions-for-dalai-lama-movie.html) not having accessories.  I watched [Katie's analysis](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/09/eveningnews/main4854957.shtml) of the Barbie phenomenon on CBS News, excellent scholarship, lots I didn't know, such a pro she is.",
