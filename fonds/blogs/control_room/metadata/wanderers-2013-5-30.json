  "content": "I showed up late for Wanderers this morning (yesterday morning by now -- it's late) and was surprised to find only Glenn.\u00a0 I was even more surprised to learn of Jay's passing, one of our group and one of Terry's oldest friends.\n\nDave DiNucci came by when we'd all left, then turned up in Pepino's when I did, having invited The Open Bastion.\u00a0 Steve is out of town but his small staff continues working in the new office.\u00a0 Dave is giving a talk tomorrow, to a meeting of an esoteric languages (computer) society.\u00a0 I will likely try to find it.\n\nTara had suggested a couple weeks ago that I might like The XX, a band she already liked a lot and followed, but had never seen perform live.\u00a0 Coexist is the album they were sharing.\n\nIndeed, concerts, rock or otherwise, have not been big on her radar.\u00a0 We joined with Rose and Elliot beforehand looking for food, though on a Memorial Day our choices were more limited than on a typical Monday.\u00a0 Parking was free.\n\nMy impression of The XX and the opening band,\u00a0 Hundred Waters, was they were not in the \"angry rebellion\" school of rock.\u00a0 That's just one branch in any case.\u00a0 This group is more introspective.\u00a0 I enjoy mellifluous and electronic, am a regular on SOMA FM, so these musicians were in my ballpark. \n\nThey're on a grueling tour playing all over North America.\u00a0 The truck and bus were parked out back.\u00a0 This is serious showbiz with lots of lights and lasers, with voices and sounds strong enough to keep it entrancing and tight.\n\nSpeaking of show biz, my thanks again to Uncle Bill for inviting me to La cage aux folles at Lakewood Center for the Arts, in Lake Oswego.\u00a0 Residents of Willamette View Manor were there in force, packing the house and raising the average age.\u00a0 Bill chatted with a woman of 94 who may not have understood the play, which is about non-nuclear and classic nuclear families and their attempts at coexistence.\n\nLindsey Walker continues to record in her basement studio.\u00a0 Her anti-fossil-fuel-use philosophy means she has no big dreams of truck and bus tours.\u00a0 Even encouraging local teens to drive to a local venue is something she's given up.\u00a0 It's experimental music and out there for free.\u00a0 Free Box is the title.\n\nMy evaluations at work have been positive, even though I've been challenging my bosses regarding some of the workflow designs.\u00a0 We're all co-developing and many variables are in flux.\u00a0 Consistently good quality performance overall is what allows space for adjustments and \"exaptations\" (experiments) to happen.\u00a0 \"Learning experimentally\" is a Quaker theme and yet obviously not anti-science.\u00a0 The myth that science and religion have to be at odds is just that, a myth (and not one of the better ones either).",
