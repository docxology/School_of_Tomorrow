Dr. DiNucci had been doing anthropology, attending the public portion of an Intel board meeting, and listening to the works of a new and already famous composer in a nearby Christian church, of which I have pictures in my Photostream.\u00a0 A really nice one.\n\nQuakers have \"meeting houses\" in this neck of the woods, if of the Unprogrammed variety (as we call ourselves), with Quaker churches in other places.\n\nWe finally got around to one of our Yahoo list topics:\u00a0 5G and its implications.\u00a0 You'd think as software engineers we'd be talking smart house IoT, but our attenders were more from the chemistry side of things, cell biologists.\u00a0 The effects of RF up and down the spectrum, on organisms up and down the scale, has been under study for some decades.\n\nAbout two decades ago, much of the focus was on \"cooking\" and how very light cooking, lowest setting, could be OK for one's brain, gonads, DNA in general.\u00a0 The concern was more therms than actual frequency, as the sophistication of cellular networks of the biological kind were only coming to be appreciated.\n\nWork in sonar probably alerted some of the same scientists to the impact of high pitched beacons and so on, on the hearing of whales.\u00a0 The nonhuman populations are not radio-silent lets put it that way. Ionized radiation, as well as not-ionized, has both health benefits and may be used as a weapon, perhaps of defense.\n\nI might have started on the wrong foot in jumping to the Gateshead Conspiracy right away, a viral topic (trending).\u00a0 The city council has acknowledged the network, but claims to know at exactly what operating frequencies it's being tested, in an effort to control lighting.\u00a0 Smart meters use the same technology.\u00a0 Back to the Internet of Things.\n\nSteve was a platinum engineer and understands the curative powers of ionized platinum, in preventing cell division.\u00a0 I don't know to what extent RF serves to catalyze these reactions.\u00a0 Plain old AC current is what he talked about.\u00a0 Think of gold plating.\n\nThis morning I wrote [Conspiracy Theories Rock!](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/conspiracy-theories-rock-eb156d0f14e5) to help some of these detectives keep their chins up. Science requires bravery as \"coming up against established dogmas\" is a perennial issue.\u00a0 Keeping writings tucked away, yet world readable to those with the URL, is the job of a filer, clerk and curator. Archivists.\u00a0 I know some of those.\n\nMost of the morning meet-up was devoted to Glenn's Show & Tell.\u00a0 He has quite a collection of Neolithic Tools.\u00a0 I took some pictures.\n\nAnyone want a free gazeebo?\u00a0 I keep meaning to put that out on Freecycle.\u00a0 It's for setting up in your backyard.\u00a0 We used to have one [from Costco](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/another-day-in-matrix.html), that gradually fell apart.\u00a0 This one looks higher end and longer lasting, but was for an art project that took a different shape in the end.\n\nAdvertising free stuff in an old blog post is probably not the brightest move.\u00a0 Check the date and time\u00a0 of this posting, and presume I handed the thing off if it's more than a week later.\u00a0 Or be in touch.\u00a0 I'm requesting the recycler pick it up.\u00a0 I had it strapped to the roof of my car at one point,\u00a0 bringing it over from Vancouver, but that's not a trick I want to repeat.Great hearing a bit about Barbara's adventures in Guyana. Jaguars, Anacondas and Vultures oh my!\nGood having Jeff Godard, Dr. DiNucci present, with Glenn presenting on Neolithic Artifacts (Show & Tell items). I'm about to upload a few pix.  Bob!  From faraway Washington!",
