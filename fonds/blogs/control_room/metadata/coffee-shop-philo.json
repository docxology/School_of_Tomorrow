Glenn's global matrix ([hexapent geometry](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/hexa-wuh.html)) will likewise get focus.My companies [use synergetic geometry](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/03/late-night-with-dave-koski.html) to self promote, for example, which will inevitably reinforce what some teenagers are now getting in school.  We aim to supplement, not replace.  Imagine [hypertoons](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/new-toyz.html), some of them commercials for [Quaker businesses](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/some-quaker-pr.html).Coffee shops are conducive to being studious (unlike taverns), or at least some of them are, at least some of the time.The group [on Synergeo](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/reviewing-review.html) (a Yahoo! eGroup) seems a little bent out of shape over the Wikipedia article on Synergetics, which at the time of this writing is devoted to an [entirely different work](http://www.amazon.com/Synergetics-Introduction-Advanced-Physics-Astronomy/dp/354040824X) by that title, than the one depicted above.So I've patiently explained that you can't copyright a title, any more than you can an individual word in common usage (such as \"gravity\"), and besides, not having anything decently comprehensive about [our Synergetics](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/) on Wikipedia just has the effect of driving more eyeballs to my sites, which is to [my commercial advantage](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/about-branding.html).So let's just say I'm not too worried about it.Per recent threads with Terry and Diane, I'm willing to promote his [ISEPP organization](http://isepp.org/) through my syndicated LCD channels (coffee shops subscribe, and [not just to mine](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/geometry-in-nature.html)) as a charitable cause, but he probably wants to see how I do it for these for-profits first, just to make sure my promotional activities are indeed truly advantageous to my various client brands -- like [Jack Daniels maybe](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/returning-to-pdx.html)?In the interests of full disclosure, my company (DWA / 4D) used to be ISEPP's bookkeeper, but those days are long gone, don't even get the free tickets anymore.So, I wonder what [Roz](http://rozsavage.com/) is up to, time to visit [her blog](http://www.rozsavage.com/blog/).  Fond memories of meeting her [on Thanksgiving](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/day-after.html) last year, while visiting with [Les](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/master-gamer.html) and [Elise](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/touring-facilities.html).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeXkFgO0q6lfJqIlLyqcK0yotB3ZJm8wxxiHA7asCwdVMDXSvU0O-wwR0Dz_zTfTmjVrfuu0wvgTmkpi00HKWVo5s4MPjHMNr6ftAHiRFZkl2XdelIjoqv66mTvU-60pM3YxBb/s1600-h/4d_id.png)",
