That doesn't mean you, a math teacher, can't go to Hedron and 3D print your own kits for classroom sharing.\u00a0 Point out what's missing, as well as what's included.\u00a0 The new generations are here to go beyond what earlier generations have accomplished, not parrot or ape them, duh.\n\nAnyway, a had my Pergamon Press bag (like a tote bag) full of plastic MITEs (some a present from D. Koski years ago) and left them a few, along with [the poster](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/plates/figs/plate03z.html) from the Synergetics Folio as included in the 2nd volume by Macmillan as well. That poster is the basis for a 3D printable kit the math teachers in project #CodeCastle will get to share about.\n\nThat color plate or poster is where the MITE is broken down into A & B modules \u2014 the kind of stuff I've taken to tweeting about.\u00a0 I got this Pergamon Press swag bag at the First International Conference on Buckminsterfullerene in Santa Barbara, as a part of an [ISEPP](http://www.isepp.org/) fellowship, [BFI](http://www.bfi.org/) also supportive.\n\nT and E have same shape however surface : volume ratios change with size. Synergetics was a work in progress, no version control, has errors\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [September 14, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/776161245091160064)\n\nWe went to [Atlas](http://atlaspizzapdx.com/) later for pizza.\u00a0 I grabbed a Mercury, the issue with [the Newcomers Guide](http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/welcome-to-portland/Content?oid=16495991), somewhat tongue in cheek per Mercury's style.\u00a0 They're reviewing the parks and saying Colonel Summers is a good one, but the editors take issue with the presumed reviewer's comment about \"hipsters\" plaguing the park, observing these are outright \"hippies\", a different species.\n\nThe joke is insiders writing for outsiders is another way of insiders showing off to other insiders.\u00a0 I could go on and on about Colonel Summers park and my adventures there with Food Not Bombs.\u00a0 Not far from the [Barley Mill](http://www.mcmenamins.com/313-barley-mill-pub-home), the McMenamins' first, on Hawthorne & SE 17th.\u00a0 Of course in reality the hipsters er hippies are integral to Portland's color and charm.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/5031900343/)",
