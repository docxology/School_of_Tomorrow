The mixture of futurism with decaying past, makes for a surreal combination.\n\nPeople of my ethnicity, strongly discouraged from weapons training, were pretty much barred from gaining experience with the kinds of aircraft considered a precursor to NASA training. \n\nI knew from an early age I'd never be accepted in [that inner circle](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/04/hb2h-hb2m.html), but I was an avid tracker and backer of the space program nonetheless, and [am still to this day](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/07/meanwhile-in-outer-space.html). \u00a0Besides, I wore glasses. \u00a0Test pilots have perfect vision.\n\n[Eugene Cernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Cernan) was maybe not as good on the bombing range as some of his friends, but at least he got to experience the G forces and show onlookers he had the right stuff. \u00a0He went in and out of San Diego on aircraft carriers. \u00a0I wasn't clear where all these bombs got dropped. \u00a0[Hawaii maybe](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/9cf6f1aa594c41fe96d2dd58ceb665fa/future-funding-murky-hawaiian-island-used-bomb-range).\n\nI hope someday those willing to train to work aboard spacecraft will find a civilian pathway open to them. \u00a0Actually we've reached that point already. \u00a0I often catch myself wishing for what has already come true.\n\nThe fact that humans were able to reach the Moon and return safely bolstered confidence in the species and ushered in new flavors of futurism, including the positive-accentuating utopianism of Bucky Fuller, which I glommed onto. \n\nCritical Path is a lot about Apollo, including in the mythological sense of escaping superstition and nightmares. \u00a0So many disciplines, working together! \u00a0Apollo also seemed an exercise in socialism, in the sense of people co-owning public assets to accomplish something together, not that capitalism didn't play a role.",
