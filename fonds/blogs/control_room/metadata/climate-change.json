  "content": "When asked about \"climate change\" I often say I don't trust the English word \"climate\", which means something like \"long term weather\".\u00a0 It's so restrictive.\n\nPeople \"Borgify\" the world, such that it shines at night, with a cosmopolis from Boston to DC, to name one of the bigger ones, and as long as CO2 doesn't increase that's considered \"no change in climate\"?\u00a0 Yet the world has been [anthropogenically](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/anthropogenically) terraformed.\u00a0 The biosphere is super-obviously different.\n\nSo I like \"Biosphere\" better than \"Climate\" for its meaning and contribution to conceptuality.\n\nDoes that make me Russian?\u00a0 At least it marks me as a GST proponent.\n\nTo make something like \"global average temperature\" the one point of debate is to dumb it down a whole lot.\u00a0 Lets talk about peak oil?\n\nThe Gibbs Phase Rule is the common core topic we should get back to in STEM education.\u00a0 The 21st century is still shedding.\u00a0 1900s muck (\"dead skin\") must be forgiven (or what else might we do with it?).",
