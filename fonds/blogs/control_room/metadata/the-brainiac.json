  "content": "Where is the brain?\u00a0 In the head of course.\n\nHowever, the meaning of a word is not a \"thing in a place\"; the meaning of \"brain\" is far from fixed or constant. \n\nThe myths that swirl together with science (gnosis) move \"brain\" (its meaning) along a trajectory, creating an arc in semantic space.\u00a0 In this mix:\u00a0 computers, the cloud, a \"singularity\" (in some myths).\u00a0 Meme soup.\u00a0 Alphabet soup.\u00a0 Google.\n\nI'm listening to Ray Kurzweil chatting with Neil deGrasse Tyson. I'm glad Ray is more in the utopian than distopian lineage, more like Bucky in that regard.\n\nThe reality of the cloud is helping people appreciate what used to be known as [the noosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere), zeitgeist or world spirit, ala Schopenhauer, Teilhard de Chardin, other transcendentalist writers.\n\nPoetry anticipates the future because language is a computation [with weighted variables](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/07/deep-believing.html) (the weights shift).\u00a0 Music anticipates how the melody might go.\u00a0 Thomas Paine.\u00a0 Prophecy.\n\nRay portrays humanoids as trapped in their own skulls for the last two million years.\u00a0 I'd suggest that reading and mass publishing created a proto-cloud well before \"outward electronics\" sped it up.\u00a0 Scholarship has benefited from these exponential curves.\u00a0 MEMEX.\n\nI say \"outward electronics\" to distinguish our hand-held devices and supercomputers from \"inward electronics\": not designed by humanoids, but helping to comprise them.\u00a0 Part of the mix.\n\nThe inward electronics joins together through \"language\" (another word of shifting meaning) to create the \"meme soup\" of culture.\n\nThen outward electronics, following Moore's Law, came along to speed up the thinking, to harness more brain power in collective endeavors.\n\nOur power to self organize is what's increasing.\u00a0 We know we have the technical wherewithal to improve living standards (end world hunger), however we lack the Will (the ability to mobilize collectively).\u00a0 Humanity is semi-paralyzed, retarded.\n\nWhat about the collective unconscious of the Jungians and such?\u00a0 A lot of that is accessible to awareness once the swirl is seen for what it is:\u00a0 a collective computation.\u00a0 We might as well just talk about \"the computer\" as in Synergetics.\u00a0 A solo cogito, chugging along, does not a railway system make.\n\nThe mix of cellular and silicon circuits makes for a living pattern, call it a \"spiritual machine\" if you wish (you may not wish), living in the sense of changing and adapting, or \"computing\" in other words.\u00a0 We're there now, however our language may not be.\u00a0 Software is thinking, laying new track, switching.\n\nRay thinks the software is converging to a better tomorrow.\u00a0 With acceleration comes less tolerance for puzzle pieces not fitting, or, alternatively, a shorter lag time before fitting them in.\u00a0 AI is proving helpful, because of RI (real intelligence) making use of it.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/28556615002/in/dateposted-public/)",
