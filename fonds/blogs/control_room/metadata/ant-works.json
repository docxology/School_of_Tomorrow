On the spectrum, it\u2019s further from For Everyman (mainstream) and closer to Quirky Kirby (one guy\u2019s take).\n\nFor example, in the course of learning more about Zelda Fitzgerald from her grandson, as his guest, I was constructing a mental timeline of that time between the wars, WW1 and WW2. H.G. Wells came to New York City for a confab on how to prevent further warring, post-WW1.\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s writing in the first person, as a journalist on the ground, at the scene. He mentions his giddiness, the effect of being in a booming city, quite different from the mood in Europe.\n\nIn looking for something to quote from those writings, I came across his Empire of the Ants. That got me to reading and listening. He\u2019d become friends with Joseph Conrad. Here we\u2019re going up the Amazon to battle smart ants. Which takes me to ants more generally and the M4W \u201ccodacombs\u201d. Ants, the many species thereof, is a core topic in that tunnel system.\n\nSpeaking of Zelda, what\u2019s coming together is the graph connecting women\u2019s suffrage, Dora Marsden, Prohibition, Art Deco, flappers, Great Gatsby, roaring 20s, H.G. Wells, feminism, Nick Consoletti\u2019s mom, (a French woman who embodied independence \u2014 she comes later on the timeline).\u00a0\n\nOrson Welles, Hearst, Homer Davenport, Silverton, New Thought, ETs, UAPs, science fiction, Martian Math\u2026 now add in all the Bucky stuff. We\u2019re talking about a time period (the 1900s basically) consisting of partially overlapping world lines (time tunnels, scenarios).\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgxLc-avt02DpwiGrK3otTX_h1CnW41JpWDORmgpmUyid0pVnbTqwmVH4BGLBGpjB_Tjk_DxhDd1LRffZnKkJObvWcIt50CT8h0PymwvOkgQAMSAyK2x-U5i6CttNibdfHSUbiqjPeokHlk5cfPMQMU4rAb42sqiv74usv-Yc7ssP4-2_Y1wZTI/s679/Screen%20Shot%202024-10-29%20at%208.29.29%20AM.png)",
