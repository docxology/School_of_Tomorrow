  "content": "I watched this again last night -- one of the few I've purchased for the purpose of sampling, as parts or as a whole, any time.  Plus I like the special features.Capturing the likes of [Robert de Niro](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000134/) and [Martin Scorsese](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000217/), as fish, is a major coup, and I salute these gentlemen for agreeing to be in a film for children, that's so kind to adults and their dark worlds, in this case that of an undersea urbia and a world of mafioso types. All the characterizations are brilliant, right down to the hermit crab, who cracks me up every time (\"you're blowing it man!\").",
