  "content": "Although dubbed the USS White Elephant by some skeptics, the fact is our people have inherited a glorious and spanking new floating city, suitable for volunteer staffing and operating, not to mention perpetual refueling.This communally owned property further bolsters the psychological power of our mostly-male, world-dominating [USSA](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/back-in-ussa.html) socialist hierarchy and its veneer of nominally \"private sector\" companies at the service of [our hive-mind collective](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/iron-mountain-revisted.html).The Empire State is suitably thrilled, according to all patriotic news sources.  Making payments for the foreseeable future, against a billion dollars and counting, to whatever [Chinese banks](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/stress-tests.html), will not be a problem.  The floating city itself is ample collateral.",
