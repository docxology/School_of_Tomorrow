  "content": "Today's discussion veered into Intellectual Property.\u00a0 I think Fuller's universal scholarship, paid for by the benefits accrued to us all by the leading innovators, has been sidelined by a gambling system that walls out most would-be participants.\u00a0 Safe to say, I'm not a big fan of the current IP regimen and don't really care what the Supreme Court has to say on the matter.\u00a0 Washington DC is a corrupt little town (OK, major city) that hasn't earned the right to dictate to anyone, about anything.\u00a0 Actually, it has subsystems with integrity and that complicates matters.\u00a0 I'm a fan of some offices.\u00a0 But IP law is BS.\u00a0 I have no problem with the fact that it's crumbling.\n\nWe also talked about the impending fluoridation of Portland's water supply.\u00a0 This is one of the few municipalities not to add fluoride yet.\u00a0 I'm against doing it, as the environmental impact of higher fluoride levels on salmon runs, such as this impact has been studied (not much), suggests that it's both significant and negative.\u00a0 I'm tired of humans whining about their teeth, claiming they're too lazy to brush with fluoride and need their dose to be administered through the public water supply.\u00a0\u00a0 What lazy good-for-nothing jerks, to risk salmon runs out of inertia.\u00a0 That sounds exactly like humans though, oblivious to the welfare of any but themselves, ugly stupid ape-like numbskulls that they be.\n\nI didn't have the luxury in wallowing in my misanthropy though.\u00a0 I was glued to my computer, actually plowing through my case load, or \"slaying the queue\" as I put it.\u00a0 Lorri calls me a slayer (blush), which makes me feel buff, whereas I'm anything but, and with two pizza slices for lunch (no breakfast) the situation is unlikely to improve -- and a beer, [C-Note by Lompoq Brewery](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/2641/12153).\u00a0 We ate after Wanderers at Oasis, right across from the Bagdad, scene of many event in this blog, from [OMSI science pubs](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/science-pub.html) to movies.\n\nThen I went to Fresh Pot next to Powell's on Hawthorne and slew the queue for many more hours.\u00a0 By late afternoon, I was ready to take a crowbar to my ceiling again, in [the Buddha Room](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/02/reconstruction-phase-2.html), and pull down more dry wall.\u00a0 I'm trying to get that room back in shape as my office / studio.\u00a0 Then I went upstairs and slaved away in Tara's room, turned upside down (figuratively) by my other daughter's crashing there for several weeks, with two pets no less.\u00a0 That was a fairly smooth interlude actually.\u00a0 She got launched in a new job, serving in one of these far flung answering services that lets people work from home, kind of like [CareWheels](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/07/wanderers-meeting-200575.html) was going to be, had that been allowed to take off (Canada said no, I thought stupidly).\n\nI've been reading Wittgenstein's Poker, which so far is good on chronicling the deterioration of the Ludwig-Bertrand friendship.\u00a0 Bertie did a lot to give Wittgenstein a leg up, but the latter grew disillusioned with \"logic\" as it was then conceived and pioneered in new directions.\u00a0 In retrospect, I'm glad the protege outgrew the master, yet I'm quick to acknowledge Bertie's positive impact on me as a boy.\u00a0 His books, in the parents' collection, helped galvanize my interest in that subject (philosophy).",
