I started watching the preshow at Hop House with Glenn, then raced over to Cork & Tap (the formal name) for a growler refill while still happy hour.\u00a0 But they'd extended it.\u00a0 I stuck around for an IPA then headed home with some groceries.\u00a0 I ended at Derek's place where he used the kitchen to bake our pizza.\u00a0 I brought the growler but we stuck to coffee.\u00a0 All of this going around was on foot.\n\nPython 3.8 has been released to the curious testers and I'm tempted to grab a copy.\u00a0 Python is under active development and isn't expected to contort as it did when we jumped from 2.x to 3.x -- a jump announced well in advance and managed bravely.\u00a0 The was to work out a few kinks in the first iteration and shift the language to a more comfortable long term form.\n\nI'm glad AAA was able to respond quickly, and also that the event was not a roadside emergency, or getting stranded in a parking lot downtown, again with Carol as I recall.\u00a0 I blogged that event too, and others before it.",
