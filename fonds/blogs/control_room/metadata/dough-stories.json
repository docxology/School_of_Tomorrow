Doh!The bank reversed some of those penalties, plus extended more credit, in the form of a new DWA credit card in my name.  It pays to know your small business banker.I'll redesign the overdraft picture, probably by offering it in-house, like she needs to keep a $200 minimum (a cushion, like an air reserve on a scuba tank (they still have those right?)).It's not like Tara did anything wrong, just that I didn't feel like sharing keys to the control panel (I'm kinda proprietary in that way), and so she had no easy/quick access to a transaction history (yes, there's keeping a check book, and yes, there's banking on-line).A friend and I bought new [prayer flags](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/10/day-for-prayer.html) today, for the back yard.  The older ones, blown down recently, are enqueued for ritual burning.A paycheck came in today, which is good as we were running beneath the surface.",
