  "content": "Per [Carol Urner's presentation](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/06/wanderers-20170613.html) to Wanderers at the Linus Pauling House, the UN Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty has passed the General Assembly, by a wide margin, as expected.\n\nThe loser nations know the ban need not apply to them.  Why?  Because they have nuclear weapons and no one tells Nuke Head Nations what to do.\n\nNevertheless, we patriots who care about reputation have some cause for celebration this July 4th, and Tillamook butterscotch ice cream is being consumed in the Urner household.\u00a0 The draft was actually adopted on the 7th, but we knew it was a done deal so were already waving the flag.\n\nGood job Iran in helping to steer the process.\u00a0 DC's mythology desperately requires Iran to be desperately seeking nuclear weapons.\u00a0 Here's another nail in that narrative's coffin.\u00a0 No one I know expects DC (not a US state) to ever reform its thinking. We expect it to remain a backwater.",
