  "content": "As one of those grandfatherly Boomers with empathy for GenZ, I'm not on the side of the cowards in the TikTok Wars.\u00a0 Here are some of my remarks on Facebook, copied here to my blog:\nThe TikTok platform is bringing the world's people together, psychologically, in a way Facebook has been failing to do.\u00a0The cowardly capitalists have a simple solution: make DC politicians bully TikTok into selling itself to a DC-friendly corporation. I can understand why \"American\" business is now seen as both craven and insidious -- there's nothing American about it.Save TikTok from the disgusting low life who want access to all its back doors, but can't get it legally, because they're not in control. Poor dears. When the Lebanese turned off Whatsapp, people poured into the streets. Americans though, are relatively meek and obedient in the face of tyranny, as we've seen. Their Constitution was taken away and they didn't lift a finger, poor slobs.\nI have a political cartoon about the situation, showing a GenZer feeling beset by the \"powers that be\". Although I grabbed said cartoon from Facebook, when I tried to share it on, I got dinged. \"We know you probably didn't mean it, but next time...\" It had a Mickey Mouse face.\u00a0 You don't mess with The Mouse (as they say in Orlando).\u00a0\n\n#CowardlyCapitalism",
