Portland maybe doesn't get the mega-ships Seattle does, but there's enough commerce to support a class of literati and digerati.\u00a0 That's the bookish layer, what makes us scholarly.\n\nBut then whereas if this were Italy we'd likely be a city of pigeons, more like Florence or Venice, we're in fact more a city of crows.\u00a0 The crow is the top bird species in this chapter.\u00a0 Crows are closer to ravens, more Poe like.\u00a0 For that reason maybe Portland is more Gothic and northern than Mediterranean?",
