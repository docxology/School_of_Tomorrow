  "content": "Almost September of 2015.\u00a0 I've not attended a Portland Python User's Group in awhile.\u00a0 True, I show up on Meetup as a co-organizer, and I am on that listserv, but others have been far more active than I, who am more just a figurehead presence.\n\nI do have a lot of memories, of where we've met, where Urban Airship used to be.\u00a0 The Fox Tower chapter, [Cubespace](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/serving-buzz.html)...\u00a0 Portland has been friendly to Python for a long time.\u00a0 We used to be \"[Poor Piggies](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2001/11/15/pythonnews.html)\" as in \"Portland Python Interest Group\" but then rebranded to \"P-PUG\" which is more dog-like.\n\nIf a sponsor buys us pizza, they get to make a pitch or something like that.\u00a0 We give companies a way to show their support in a public manner and to recruit and/or offer services at the same time, right when people are feeling good about how you're feeding the Python ecosystem.\u00a0 Thanks to Rentrak in this case.\u00a0 Great Hot Lips pizza, hard to beat.\u00a0 I stopped at two slices [sic], knowing my proclivity to eat an infinite amount, especially when it's gratis.\u00a0 I hoard calories, as if that made any sense.\n\nSpeaking of hoarding, I was enjoying my faster fiber optic connection today, downloading a large number of [OSCON 2015 videos](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/oscon-followup.html).\u00a0 Once on OB (OpenBastion) I can archive the media to one of the USB drives I have floating around.\n\nOf course coming here on a Thursday means I'm missing Thirsters.\u00a0 That's a conversation I've been enjoying but I need to offset political chatter with software engineering, as a matter of diet.\n\nPaul is here with me, a co-worker.\u00a0 We'll probably grab a couple brews after.\u00a0 We're not serving any alcohol at the meetup, which is fine with me.\u00a0 Those enjoying such beverages have plenty of options after it's over.\n\nWalking here from Stark and SW Sixth, about a half a mile, was a joy, as it took me through interesting intersections.\u00a0 I found myself snapping those pictures.\u00a0 At Pioneer Courthouse Square:\u00a0 an Italian Cultural Festival.\u00a0 Wow, to take over the downtown square:\u00a0 that proves Italy has mega-clout in our CBD.\n\nHey, Patrick just showed up.\u00a0 Party!\n\nRentrak is shifting from Perl to other dynamic languages.\u00a0 They aggregate data from TV remotes through cable companies, giving more insights than the old way of doing it.\u00a0 They're looking for engineers.\n\nRobert Dordier has been working on a computer algebra system named Maxima for Jupyter, the language-independent part of I-Python.\u00a0 It's browser-embedded.\u00a0 Maxima was started in 1968 as a LISP project.\u00a0 The standard UI is ASCII-art console.\u00a0 How might Jupyter make this better?\n\nZeroMQ provides the sockets from front and back ends in Dordier's solution.\u00a0 The I-Python Kernel on the server talks to several front ends at once.\u00a0 We're talking about a REPL based on LaTeX and SVG for output.\u00a0 Pretty typeset math.\u00a0\u00a0 Main takeaway:\u00a0 Jupyter may be customized.\n\nAmy Boyle presented a talk entitled Data Transformation Super Powers with Digital Signal Processing.\u00a0 OSCON wanted the \"super powers\" to fit with this year's theme, where she originally gave this talk.\n\nShe took us through what it looks like to use NumPy to do Fast Fourier Analysis on audio through time, and then how to doctor images with PIL.\u00a0 The Mathematica demos cover a lot of this same territory.\u00a0 Both of these talks echo patterns in the Mathematica ecosystem.\n\nAs a grand finale she dove into JPEG, an algorithm not a format, created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group. I didn't know RGB was converted to YCbCr.\u00a0 Amy's 'splainings were enlightening.\n\nI think we'll jump into Paul's rig and hit Lucky Lab on Hawthorne.\u00a0 Perl Mongers meet there.\u00a0 Paul, like Rentrak, is rooted in Perl, newer to Python.\u00a0 These two subcultures like to cross-fertilize.\u00a0 I often joke the Republic of Perl is so close to Pythonia that you can see \"Guido's house\" in the background (a windmill; he's Dutch; get it?).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/20753636219/in/dateposted-public/)",
