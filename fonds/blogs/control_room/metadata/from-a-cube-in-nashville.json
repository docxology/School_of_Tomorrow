  "content": "I'm sitting in a large cube in Nashville, Tennessee, waiting for rush hour to finish.  Earlier today, I committed some [autobio to the Math Forum](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1356149), talking about my post Princeton years (early 1980s).We visited the Nashville Zoo this afternoon. Lots of families had the same idea (great weather, no school). Many of the exhibited species had \"vanishing animal\" icons on their plaques. We'd like to turn that around of course, hence my placement of the elephant clipart on my [GST poster](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html) (in case you were wondering).",
