  "content": "We don't have [a JIRA instance](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or others issues tracker, though it's on the drawing boards to get one as a service, so I'm noting some tasks here.\n\n(a)\u00a0 Outreach & Visitation is following a number of Friends, whom we might call \"isolated\" except \"Isolated Friend\" is a term reserved to a type of member.\u00a0 Friends (RSoF) as implemented within NPYM has [a membership aspect](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/06/membership-matters.html) baked in.\u00a0 But this new column is independent of membership and could be coded as FollowedBy with OVS as a property of that relationship.\u00a0 Except that's [graph database talk](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/graphing-relationships.html).\u00a0 These days, we're in SQL.\n\n(b)\u00a0 continue [engaging #M3](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/hash-tag-m3.html) re gender attributes we might want to add.\u00a0 The current schema appears stripped of any gender or ethnicity information.\u00a0 That may be intentional, or M3 may, at the corporate level, suffer from an attention deficit, a common phenomenon among corporate persons.\u00a0 M3 is a flagship Monthly Meeting (MM) albeit not the only one in our region.\u00a0 Its choosing to [drop gender](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/11/gender-again.html), and our regional schema following suit, should get some notice as a landmark decision, versus happening almost as a sleight of hand when no one is looking.\n\nI've got the ball rolling on both (a) and (b) by the end of 2014, but see many steps will be needed before either issue is closed.",
