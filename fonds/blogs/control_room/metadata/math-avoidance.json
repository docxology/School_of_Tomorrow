  "content": "The accusation of \"[math avoidance](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9803473)\" comes from those claiming our K-12 maths curriculum (using the UK plural) is too watered down, too diluted with geegaws and gizmos.\u00a0 It's just \"toy math\".\n\nWhereas I'm sympathetic to the accusation, I do need to ask if it's \"math avoidance\" to simply bury all the [late 20th Century innovations](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/04/trite-math.html) documented in architecture, regarding the relationship of geodesic spheres to [the virus and buckyball both](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica1.html).\n\nIs it wise to be so ignorant of this heritage?\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/18934772150)\n\nFig. 988.12 Icosahedron Inscribed Within Octahedron:\nThe four-frequency tetrahedron inscribes an\ninternal octahedron within which may be inscribed a\nskew icosahedron. Of the icosahedron's 20\nequiangular triangle faces, four are congruent with\nthe plane of the tetra's faces (and with four external\nfaces of the inscribed octahedron). Four of the icosahedron's\nother faces are congruent with the\nremaining four internal faces of the [ octahedron ]. Two-fifths\nof the icosa faces are congruent with the octa\nfaces. It requires 24 S Quanta Modules to fill in the\nvoid between the octa and the icosa.\n\nReaders of [Synergetics](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/findex/fx0900.html) already know of the volume 20 VE, which contracts to a volume 18.51 Icosa [by Jitterbugging](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/02/a-tale-of-two-logos.html).\u00a0 That's our s-Factor at work i.e. (Svol / Evol) to the -1 i.e. Evol / Svol.\n\n20 * (1\u00a0 / sFactor) = 18.51...\n\nAs seen from the excerpt below, from a Python program, these two volumes come with \"S + s3\" and \"E + e3\" expressions for volumetric decompositions.\n\nIn this case-sensitive notation, S:s3 == E:e3 == Phi ** 3 i.e. the linear dimensions of s3 are 1/phi those of the S-module, ditto e3 vis-a-vis the E-module.\n\nThe S-module has a tetra-volume of pow(phi, -5)/2.\n\nprint(\"VE:         \", 20,                 420 * Svol + 100 * s3)\nprint(\"Icosa:      \", 20 * sFactor ** 1,  420 * Evol + 100 * e3)\n\nWith output:\n\nVE:          20 19.99999999999996\nIcosa:       18.5122958682192 18.512295868219162\n\nAnother Icosa-to-Cubocta relationship involves not Jitterbugging, but keeping the faces flush, eight of them, though only partially overlapping, as shown in the figure below: \n\nFig. 988.00 Polyhedral Evolution: S Quanta Module:\nComparisons of skew polyhedra. \n\nWe could call this a \"skew\" relationship and applying 1/sFactor twice to the 18.51 icosahedron takes use to what Koski affectionately calls the \"Small Guy\" cubocta, of volume ~15.86065.\n\nWhat is it's frequency, assuming Icosa edges = 2?  Recalled 20 * F**3 is our formula:\n\nprint(\"Small Guy edge:\", 2 * pow(sFactor ** -3, 1/3))\n\nOutput:\n\nSmall Guy edge: 1.8512295868219202\n\nWhat's interesting about that number, a linear dimension, is that it's 1/10th the volume of the jitterbugged icosahedron's.\u00a0 The differences in the ending digits above have merely to do with floating point error margins.\n\nSo what is the volume of the Icosa within the volume 4 Octa of Figure 988.12?\n\nClearly it's 4 - 24 * Svol or 4 - 24 * (pow(phi, -5)/2) = ~2.917961.\nIn Python again, and using David's decomposition formula:\n\n>>> Svol = pow(phi, -5)/2\n>>> s3 = Svol * pow(phi, -3)\n>>> 60 * Svol + 20 * s3  # S + s3 form\n2.9179606750063085\n\nApplying the reciprocal of the sFactor twice more, to this tiny Octahedron-inscribed icosahedron, nets us the volume of its \"skew mate\":  the volume 2.5 cuboctahedron, i.e. 1/8 the volume of the cuboctahedron of volume 20, faces flush with the same Octa of volume 4.\n\n>>> baby\n2.9179606750063085\n>>> baby * (1/sfactor) * (1/sfactor)\n2.5000000000000107",
