  "content": "At least the Pope is doing his job, [coming out swinging](http://www.fcnl.org/issues/item.php?item_id=1657&issue_id=48) against nuclear weapons across the board.Inferior brands of pseudo Christian take a more forked-tongue approach:  put the screws [on Iran](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran15nov15,0,7182826.story) while hypocritically reserving the right to stockpile, not just nukes, but WMDs of all kinds, to be used not just in self-defense, but in preemptive wars of choice that pander to mob hysteria fanned by self-interested corporate media invested in war profiteering.These hollow-voiced pundits and newscasters are selling out their country by turning it into a ridiculous paper tiger, worthy only of mockery and disdain.Fortunately, [the USA](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html) still has a few patriotic defenders able to rise above being cynical, manipulative losers.  One or two of them might even get to be president someday.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjatb2fN5UwaHayc_u2ffJFzu0e0DfnIeUsPrX_H6DjDQZssePl0b0rFLnU3CbbNV2Bu4oznSxc1Ifh1KegR8oieDUEGhzcOlMsilpYt2Adz0T26YI7HZHwitHUE_LQgWBfFKSD/s1600-h/flag.gif)",
