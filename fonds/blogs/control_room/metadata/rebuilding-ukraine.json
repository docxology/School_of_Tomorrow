  "content": "The billions allocated to Ukraine could be spent on civilian reparations (repairs) in case Ukraine is still a sovereignty.\u00a0 The choice to not spend that money on a military spectacular is probably not theirs to make however.\u00a0 Those billions would not even rebuild the army, navy and air force already lost.\u00a0 But do they need to be?\n\nThe number of civilian jobs open to EU, UK and US types would be proportionally higher in a neutral, vs a NATO, Ukraine. In terms of employment, insisting on narrow specialization in weapons training is an anathema, the opposite of diversified growth, more of what brought the USA to the brink of extinction (some would say that brink has been crossed).\n\nSyria is a good example.\u00a0 After years of civil war, there's been some chance to rebuild in Aleppo.\u00a0 Not every apartment building has to be restored.\u00a0 Sometimes the better plan is to finish the demolition, level, and build atop the rubble of what came before.\u00a0 That's if the new building techniques are any better.\u00a0 Perhaps people would prefer a Nomadland, featuring semi-mobile vehicles they could live in.\n\nOregonians have connections to Ukraine and have no reason to withhold from speculation, when it comes to plans to rebuild.\u00a0 A demilitarized Ukraine could be just as prosperous, with tourism permitted from all corners.\u00a0 Ecotourists especially.\n\nOf course the big money showcased as passing through Congress, a choreographed maneuver, presupposes this funding is spoken for, and is designed to enter the coffers of NATO's vendors, to pay for new inventory, under the command of their socialized military personnel.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nUkraine does not have a say in NATO currently, but as the recipient of so much largess, is cast as forever grateful.\u00a0 Without NATO, where would Ukraine be today?\n\nThe Russian side is already starting to rebuild, as winning over a new citizenry implies a trajectory back to civilian normalcy. The best PR is to begin repairs.\n\nRussia does not need the EU to crumble, as basket case neighbors are prone to poor judgement.\u00a0 Their \"nothing to lose\" mentality gets the better of them.\u00a0 Extremists exploit extreme conditions.\u00a0 Who wants to deal with freezing Germans?\u00a0 NS2 could be turned on tomorrow.\u00a0 Of course DC would object.\n\nThe challenge has been the challenge of brain surgery:\u00a0 how to address the issue without killing the patient.\u00a0 In being a huge part of Europe, Russia has been operating on itself.\n\nRebuilding Ukraine might not be a high priority for every developer though.\u00a0 Many on the sidelines, in a cheerleading capacity, are convinced they're in a position to extract their pound of flesh.\u00a0 Their desire for vengeance is high.\u00a0 Civilians getting on with their lives takes a back seat.\u00a0 Perhaps the plan is to keep them as displaced refugees and stoke their resentment?\n\nAllowing Ukraine to carry on without being remotely controllable from Washington DC, goes against what many a control freak requires, to feel secure.\u00a0 If they don't feel secure, then it's their business to make sure none of us do.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStopping the rebuilding of a civilian Ukraine, in favor of more combat and degradation, could be what some of the limited liability boards have in store for us.\u00a0 They're maybe not in the rebuilding business.\n\nThe question is whether the large bureaucracies will follow them, or expel them, as no longer representing the more profitable way forward.\u00a0 Helping refugees, while rebuilding a humane habitat is potentially one of the biggest businesses of all time.",
