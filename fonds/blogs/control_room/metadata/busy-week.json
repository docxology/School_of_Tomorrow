  "content": "I'm super booked this week, having committed months ago to an east coast timed Python training. I just completed Session 2 of a west coast timed training about an hour ago.\u00a0 I get to snooze a few hours, then dive in again, using a somewhat alien control panel.\n\nThen it's off to Sellwood to launch a new Learning to Code program, the groundwork having been laid by parents, guardians, coworkers, school staff.\u00a0 Then there's MIT Scratch and Codesters, the star e-toyz of our show.\n\nCarol, in the meantime, is enmeshed with Friends on the UN Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty, which is up for signing. Thanks to many media still taking most cues from DC, a lot of our people don't even know the history.\u00a0 They learn to switch media if wanting to follow developments.\n\nQuakers and the USG have been on opposite sides of \"abolition\" before now, with some politicians able to think ahead.\u00a0 Lots of medical science reminds us that nuclear war, even just preparing for one, is toxic and unhealthy.\u00a0 We lose IQ. \n\nCarol, a member of WILPF, is working closely with PSR as well.\u00a0 This alphabet soup may not mean anything at the outset, but a quick search will get you in the loop, if that's where you want to be.\u00a0 Some loops are intriguing, like Hyperloop One, whereas others are more noose-like, as useful as a dead albatross.\n\nAlso I'm on the warpath for C6XTY, an abbreviated way of saying my ethnic group has some strong biases in terms of what curriculum upgrades we need.\u00a0 Getting those upgrades implemented may appear to be happening despite \"over my dead body\" style resistance, hence the warpath metaphor, suitable for \"inward weapons\" oriented Friends.",
