Concave dents hold water and other fluids. \u00a0Then we have those flying caltrop looking devices, but more commonly the XYZ 6-spoke flyer. \u00a0\n\nThese flyers might have drone aspects, depending on the world we\u2019re in. \u00a0Yes, computer game talk. \u00a0That\u2019s a new anchoring shoptalk at FSI, with Gary our project lead.\n\nDo we need at least flyers for birds eye views? \u00a0A rule when world building could be that we have no disembodied viewpoints. \u00a0We do have tiny insect-like flyers. \u00a0\n\nAs a \u201cfirst person\u201d you\u2019re enabled to \u201clook from\u201d these myriad viewpoints, but all are embodied and have their physical limitations.\n\nThe term \u201cquadray\u201d may evoke \u201cquadcopter\u201d and sure, we\u2019re fine with a drone-friendly shoptalk. \u00a0The quadcopter is a familiar drone design.\u00a0\n\nThe caltrop inside the regular tetrahedron, however, has any two of its rays at 109.5 degrees to each other (that\u2019s rounded). \u00a0Here we get to jump into trig.\n\nHowever, before jumping into trig, our games exercise the notion of \u201cvector sum\u201d by adding these pre-existing rays in obvious ways. \u00a0The parallelogram model holds. \u00a0Connect the tips and reflect the resulting triangle.\n\nWe have six pairs, for example, that cancel each other except for contributing to the length of a bisector. \u00a0The six spokes of XYZ have now emerged. \u00a0The caltrop begets the jack.\n\nThen we have sets of three defining the edges of a quadrant. \u00a0They cancel (balance) by adding to the length of a ray out through the face center. \u00a0The four sets of three add to give the vertexes of the inverse tetrahedron.\n\nWe might add any pair (parallelogram model), then a third quadray (parallelogram again).\n\nThe tetrahedron and its inverse define the merkaba star (or stella octangula), likewise the corners of our duo-tet volume 3 cube. \u00a0That\u2019s right, volume 3, and our tetrahedrons are volume 1.\n\nJumping into trig, we want students to remember the A modules, 12 right and 12 left. \u00a0The quadrays define \u00a0their spines. \u00a0The fact that the origin floats above the floor, 1/3 of the way to the opposite apex, gives us a tent pole to play with.\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGq-uke7EjlWQPgSFfAQ9jiIsmErOMduFivjFUcG-FQu9A7FKLfCXVMRHDseJ-pN-POd9NqwdWLK7WDC3awxC6ypZY5EPJPeWJ81SA3lALSR_SaL01DgfgwzpNEd_TqF7wyWRuNFvIblo_z7EGXF-Iv1-UcRyolHleyA16A_dfMGUP1PBJkQ/s894/61699D16-9792-4505-830C-7E2AA929B0DA.gif)\nIn jumping to trig, we focus on the arccos (adjacent FE / hypotenuse CE) = acos(1/3) = angle CEF. \u00a0That gives\u00a070.5287794, which, subtracted from 180, is our intra-quadray angle: \u00a0109.4712206.\n\nThe fact that Buckminster Fuller and friends would add substantively new language games around polyhedrons starting in the 1970s with the publication of Synergetics, when rectilinear orthodoxies were already well established, would give arrowhead math a subversive and/or discordant aura.\n\nDiscordant themes tend to set up a dialectic and drive discussion and debate in the direction of a new synthesis. \u00a0We see that happening in connection with Pentagon Math.",
