Proceeds fund our non-profit programs. \n\nWe get around needing to provide ADA compliance to this rickety old building (the one we're touring) by having the organizing meetups elsewhere. \n\nWe can do sales outside on summer days, so if you're on crutches you'll still get access.\n\n[The competition](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/05/axing-staff-in-west-region.html) wants a strictly back office low profile in a little trafficked part of town (comparatively). \n\nTheir building is for sale and unstable in that sense but the back office people don't seem to worry as they have few responsibilities and no programs. \n\nOur program people are in the field. \n\nWhy a small city like Portland should get Philadelphia-type jobs is a bit of a mystery. \n\n\"Back office\" is what Friends Center is for, is what we thought, not West Region where we need to be [public-facing and engaged](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/04/portland-afsc-support-committee.html).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/16941775754)",
