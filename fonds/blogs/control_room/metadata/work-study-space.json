  "content": "As we move around in the work place, we may get a private office, a cubicle, or some position on a Star Trek bridge with lots of people doing their jobs.\u00a0 More of a situation room.\n\nFinding places to concentrate and study becomes a first order of business when landing in a new place.\u00a0 Where do I charge my devices?\u00a0 Do we have WiFi?\n\nI understand the need to go off the grid, so to speak, and do that myself.\u00a0 I'm not always connected. However I do my best to take advantage of certain opportunities.\n\nTwitter is more a message in a bottle in a lot of ways.\u00a0 Big data farms that sift for a living, might return a string of breadcrumbs.\u00a0 I seek such trails left by others.\n\nWe don't know, in putting ourselves out there, precisely what difference we'll be making. However it's less a matter of humility and more one of shirking responsibility to suggest we're making no difference.\u00a0 I make a difference.\u00a0 You do too.\n\nIf all you get is a locker and crowded classrooms, TVs blaring, then you're not getting much time to really think on your own.\u00a0 Some lifestyles afford precious little privacy, if any.\n\nIn designing an education system, ask yourself:\u00a0 if \"learning to code\" is what I say I encourage, how am I structuring the curriculum to permit plenty of alone time?\n\nYes, I know, coding is not always done solo.\u00a0 However one does need that sense of a workbench, of tools.\u00a0 You'll need your editor, your interpreters... you don't need me to tell you what you need, in most cases.\n\nDoes your school help you amass a wealth of tools you know how to use?",
