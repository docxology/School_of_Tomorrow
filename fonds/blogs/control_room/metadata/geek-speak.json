Once you're playing poker, you have to factor in more game theory, including calling a bluff.\n\nBusiness transactions happen faster against the background of shared values.\u00a0 You're on the same time, as Humans in Universe.\n\nWe've talked about some of the buffer zones, in Germany, in Korea, where a kind of reunification in cyberspace creates new opportunities for identification. Hackers live on the edges, connecting and reconciling. They're regarded with suspicion, because of the invisible worlds they frequent.\n\nIf the code is all open source, freely fixable and upgradable, then one has the basis for an economy, in terms of accessible tools and marketable skills.\u00a0 The hackers found a way to survive, if not always thrive. They inhabit an underground, complete with comics.\n\nWe call it a \"gig economy\" and are working on a safety net layer, as actors aren't always working on a project.\u00a0 We remember Education Automation by RBF, about freeing us, as scholars, to study.\u00a0 Andrew Yang and MLK pop up in our conversations.",
