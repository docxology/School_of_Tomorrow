  "content": "I'm in an intensive Sociology workshop today, in my city-as-campus Portland context. Right now, I'm connected to a Pashtun Institute guy based at Rutgers, soon to defend his thesis. We're talking about the concept of \"national consciousness\" via the Math 4 Wisdom channel. I'll embed the video when it becomes available.\n\nThen I get my time with the retired librarians, drop in personalities, continuing the action at El Barrio, which burned up in a fire at the outset of 2024 (no one hurt, extensive property damage to El Mercado).\n\nFinally, this evening I plan to attend a meetup of the rebooting Thirsters, a group of conversationalists with a strong background in sociology, academically, through Peace Corps and by other means.\n\nI had a good first experience with Sociology as a discipline thanks to my 8th grade teacher at ASOR, Fred Craden.\u00a0\n\nIn my twenties, when I returned to Portland to settle long term, I achieved an adult level relationship with Dr. Charles Bolton, a career professor of sociology who first crossed paths with my parents in their University of Chicago days (when I was born).\n\nThese were notes I took during Aslam's meetup. I also posted some follow-up questions to the listserv.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/53518615436/in/dateposted/)\nFrom the homework readings:\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/53517748837/in/dateposted/)",
