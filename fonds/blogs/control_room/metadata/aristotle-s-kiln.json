  "content": "Per my comment to CJ today on Facebook, in response to [a thread on Martin Heidegger](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/08/wiring-in-heidegger.html), and bridges to the Bucky stuff, we could take Aristotle's four causes, and integrate MH's observation that they all stick together like a single glue-ball (or glass bead):\u00a0 materials, design, maker, purpose.\n\nMake that a Tetrahedron next time.\n\nI then thought of calling this a \"kiln\" in the sense of an oven or cooker, the alchemist's crucible.\u00a0 We're following the \"silver chalice\" theme to some extent.\u00a0 What pops out of the oven is thereby unconcealed, a new truth of some kind.\n\nWith modern technology comes the possibility of mass production, or mass reproducibility, which becomes our way of optimizing distribution in the coming digital age (MH was prescient).\n\nThe open source free software world (terminology) already includes a lot of baking and cooking metaphors.\u00a0 We also go through iterations or versions.\u00a0 Our creations evolve.\u00a0 The design may be somewhat fluid, and melt with new purpose, without sacrificing all the materials.\n\nRecycling happens.",
