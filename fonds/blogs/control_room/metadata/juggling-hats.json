Smedley Butler](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/esozone-talk.html), that \"war is a racket\" and/or some kind of [Business Plot](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7832027). \u00a0But is it even that well thought out?\n\nSo the best place to focus on improving the curriculum, if the Feds plan to walk their talk, is right there on the bases, where Feds have the most control. \u00a0Show us how your curriculum is paving the way for a bright future, for the Okinawans included. \u00a0Don't just kick the can down the road, like Gen. Colin Powell did, by making militarism the solution for yet another decade.\n\nGetting kids in base schools to report back should not be a problem. \u00a0I'm sure some enjoy the lifestyle and wouldn't want it to end. \u00a0But I'm not saying so-called \"[Girl Scout Math](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/70136)\" (an operation) [and the like](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/12/wanderers-20101229.html) has to mean giving up access to airstrips. \u00a0Small planes would come and go. \n\nThe new base wouldn't be needed, but that was a lavish and unnecessary expense anyway, on the chopping block like [Manas](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/7274911630/in/photostream) (easier to chop given it doesn't belong to the Russians and Kyrgystanis the way Manas does).\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5498420758/)\n:: old recruiting poster (click for larger view) ::",
