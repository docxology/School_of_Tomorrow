  "content": "A talented family with all its physical needs met, freely explores [metaphysical issues](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/gobbledygook.html).These don't seem the happiest people in the world, but hey, karma is like that (lots to work through, and moving too quickly may be dangerous).Each cast member takes a few steps along an inward/outward journey.I wish more families were free to work out at this level, instead of spending so much time scrabbling for food, water and shelter.  Moving too slowly may likewise be dangerous.",
