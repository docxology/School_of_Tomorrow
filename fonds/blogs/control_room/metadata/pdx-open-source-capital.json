  "content": "So I'm in a small coffee shop. Terry is at the house, with another business associate and my wife the bookkeepper for ISEPP, as a consultant.Terry wishes the plan to rennovate the property next to Pauling Campus, the renting office repair store, into a Cafe Philosophicus or like that, might materialize.  Just needs the $100K.Don's asking \"how\" (his name will appear this time).So PDX was in some write-up in Christian Science Monitor [today](http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/1128/p03s02-ussc.html), as an up-and-coming hub of the global open source network, thanks to the hard work of so many geeks (aka software and hardware engineers), trying to write some benign-enough science / fiction.Terry just walked in.  Our meeting resumes...Derek appears.",
