  "content": "This is a French title, which you might think hard to find in my neighborhood. \u00a0Not so, given Movie Madness. \u00a0Filed under French, amidst the Thrillers.\n\nThat said, it's PG-tame and thankfully not bloody, not too horrific. \u00a0In that sense it's a good kid-friendly non-shocking intro to Spy vs. Spy ([ala Mad](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/01/random-walking-in-ivm-fm.html)) with the French caught between superpowers, trying to preserve some sense of family values and humanity amidst the monsters (CIA and KGB).\n\nThe French engineer wasn't asking to be involved in espionage, but given the setting, the French Residence (embassy) in Moscow, this seems hard to avoid, especially when an idealistic Russian spy (the worst kind) decides to change world history for the benefit of his engineer son. \n\nLike the dad in Breaking Bad, this Russian dad has trouble communicating about his world to his offspring, let alone to his wife. \u00a0The sense of\u00a0subterfuge, \u00a0of dad being up to something, pervades the French family as well, though those kids are pretty young to be following any adult plot.\n\nThe movie purports to be to be based on true events, but we have to decide for ourselves what that means. \u00a0Given how far [Willem Dafoe](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/cry-baby-movie-review.html) is from William J. Casey, both in appearance and character, we can push the dial pretty far into fictional. \u00a0\"Feeney\" at least rhymes (no doubt the intent).\n\nCasey's tenure marked an apogee in CIA-KGB understanding (like Apollo-Soyuz), with the USSR not \"too big to fail\" after all (a not ungraceful exit, for a country that size). Russian spies would slip in for dinner in DC, then slip loose from their handlers, a thawing of the Cold War. \u00a0Perestroika, Glasnost. \u00a0Fast forward: \u00a0Litvinenko,\u00a0[the Russian spy in England](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-202_162-2207398.html), fighting quasi-solo against corruption, a saint.\n\nBut one could say all of the above is consistent with Farewell, in the sense of there being some high level coup that enabled the USA to \"go dark\" for awhile. \u00a0You could spin that as a rupture in security, with plans for the space shuttle, submarine routes, test plans, all sloshing out in the open, to the embarrassment of the spied upon.\n\nIn retrospect, \nEmir Kusturica's character, Sergei Gregoriev, the Russian, is like another Manning, treated as a traitor by his contemporaries. \u00a0The illusion of stopping the leaks would lead Reagan to take bold action -- is what this storyline infers (and the rest is history).\n\nI tried Battlestar Galactica again as a part of this same rental. \n\nThe first two disks were enough to remind me of the fantasy, its many borrowed elements. \u00a0It's a put-together interior, a mental vista, an invisible landscape, not unlike this French embassy in Moscow, a thinly veiled dollhouse of a world. \n\nLike we're really looking into the minds of the dollhouse's (meetinghouse's) overseers, perhaps young boys as these are also \"action figures\" (if \"dolls\", as in \"idols\", are a problem for some reason). \n\nLooking good in uniform, in\u00a0silhouette perhaps: \u00a0it's a lot about dressing up and acting the part. \u00a0In spydom too of course, fashion matters, plus there's the car you drive. \u00a0[James Bond's](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/casino-royale-movie-review.html) has a defibrillator.",
