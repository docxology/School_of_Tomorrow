  "content": "[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/timessquareball.jpg)I recombined a lot of my Math Forum themes into some [year end polemics](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1317644&tstart=0), hoping to spark some interest in our open source agenda for the new millenium. Having [the ball in Times Square](http://www.nysun.com/article/25159?page_no=1) be a 3-frequency geodesic certainly helps (10ff+2; V+F=E+2; N:2N:3N and like that).But newspaper editors don't seem to have much time for a high tech math-science spin (fullerenes, viral shells, octet truss...), especially one that could snowball. Can't have that. Better to recycle the usual stories we always get around this time of year ([booze etc.](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/loose-ends.html)).",
