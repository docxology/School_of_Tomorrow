  "content": "I showed up late, per usual on Wednesday mornings, to catch the balance of an excellent, highly technical presentation by Wanderer Nancy Ankorn, CPA.  She ran through the for-profit business models defined by the USA tax code:  sole proprietor- ships, partnerships, C & S corporations, LLPs and LLCs.From my viewpoint, the partnership information was the most interesting.  And yes, the K-1 is a lot like a 1099.On the back burner (via the Ubuntu Dell), I participated in an exchange on Quaker-P about religion and business.  So when are Quakers going to run some key businesses again, like in the good old days?  I don't think the [oats guy](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/quaker-politics_110167340290091180.html) is really a CEO, more of a figurehead, like Betty Crocker.Nancy really knows her job well, and what with the rules always changing, that requires lots of study.  The apparatus she monitors forms a basis for lots of flashy [North American soaps](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077000/), like my friends in Dhaka (Bangladesh) would watch.  Turns out Nancy and I are both Warren Buffett fans.Amazingly, [Jim Buxton](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/nehalem-watershed-wanderers-meeting.html) joined us this morning, despite [major flooding](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/quiet-monday.html) in his neck of the woods.",
