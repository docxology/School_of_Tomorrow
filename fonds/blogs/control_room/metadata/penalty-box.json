  "content": "I got slapped on the wrist for some unfortunate use of \"cannibals\" and \"Tyson\" (as in chicken) in the same comment. Some story about the spread of covid in some corporate setting: we get a lot of those stories in our news feeds these days. Our feed bags.\n\nThe last time I got a time out, or maybe it was just a deletion, is when I forwarded a political cartoon in which Mickey Mouse appeared in an unflattering light.\u00a0 Again, covid related.\n\nOK, that's fine. I'm treading on the edge, hitting up against the Facebook electric fences. I'm assuming this is AI all the way, given the blizzard of snowflakes (comments) assaulting the service very second. There's no time for a human censor.\u00a0 Perhaps these come along after the fact and audit, en masse.... if government were transparent, we'd know more.\n\nThinking over the situation, I'm pretty content with the ammo anyone would have, thanks to me in particular, if wanting to pursue a positive futurism, probably the best we've got, since for the most part people don't consume themselves with \"planning\" as a pass time. I was born into a planning + activist family.\u00a0 My education was appropriately big picture, as was my worldly upbringing.\n\nPart of the promise of the Synergetics philosophy is inherent in its reliance on tension over compression. This isn't about pushing hard to make happen.\u00a0 Lets see if humanity wants to pull itself together.\u00a0 We know it could, has the option.\u00a0 If it doesn't, that looks more like a choice than some tragic heroic failure.\u00a0 The angels will chuckle.\u00a0 Or call 'em demons, whatever.\n\nMy efforts and curriculum design have been enabled at every turn by the latest technology, so it always feels like my skills might be equal to the task.\u00a0 To a point.\u00a0 Then it's no longer about my skills in particular. I'm happy to kick back. Show me what you've got.",
