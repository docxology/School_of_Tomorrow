  "content": "Today I dive back into data science world, with a new cohort.\u00a0 This curriculum is primarily not by me; I add some wrinkles.\u00a0 I'm happy with the content though, and don't mind using the canned slide decks.\n\nIn the embedded video I make it sound like people using decks by others is either a no-no or has never been thought of before I came along.\u00a0 On the contrary, many a corporate training, say an onboarding, was canned long ago as a PowerPoint.\u00a0 Every day, people sit through presentations of slides done by people other than the presenter.\n\nThat being said, in wanting to inject my own contribution into the mix, I get to stand back and take a look at current and/or best practices, regarding slide decks and the protocols around sharing them.",
