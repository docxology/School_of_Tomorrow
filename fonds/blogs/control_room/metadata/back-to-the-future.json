  "content": "I've flashed on the Nord Stream debacle a few times, saying it couldn't be the work of a great nation.\u00a0 Not with a coverup.\u00a0 If it were heroism, brag about it.\u00a0 But if it's not, then slink around and act guilty.\n\nSo in that sense, my USA, as I was saying, was not behind such a thing.\u00a0 But, Planet of the Apes style, we could nevertheless have Ollie North types with the keys to this or that meeting room.\u00a0 I'm not saying people living in The District (aka City of Morons) weren't complicit.\n\nSo we would have to call such a cabal pro-Ukrainian right?\u00a0 So that part of the yacht story would read correctly.\u00a0 It wasn't the USA aka Uncle Sam, not seen since the 1980s and suspected a goner, if not making a comeback, so it must have been some pro-Ukrainian group.\u00a0 Fine.\n\nWhether they used a yacht or not, vs suckered the Norwegians into being the bad guys, time will tell.\u00a0 Either way, the USA was not involved.\u00a0 By definition.\u00a0 There's no need to lie about what happened to protect the USA.\u00a0 If there's lying happening, it's to protect some pro-Ukrainian group.",
