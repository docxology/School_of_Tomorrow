  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/26515573263/in/dateposted-public/)\n\n:: bagdad interior ::\n\nI think what we're supposed to get is Captain America is more than ambivalent about joining some United Nations, much as Brits feel conflicted about the European Union.\u00a0 What if the UN picks the wrong bad guys, or fails to act when bad guy pillage is immanent?\u00a0 The Avengers are leery of trusting anyone's judgement but their own.\n\nHowever, [shades of The Incredibles](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/incredibles-movie-review.html), ordinary mortals are sick and tired of their \"collateral\" status, as in \"collateral damage\".\u00a0 The collateral rises up and says \"[enough is enough already](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/05/raging-against-king.html)\" and asks the Avengers for a modicum of accountability.\u00a0 Captain America has his moral qualms about this.\u00a0 For one thing he's harboring a terrorist, his friend that gets activated by keywords.\n\nI came to this movie with [a sieve-like memory](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/06/iron-man-2-movie-review.html), a lot of the sand having trickled away.\u00a0 Like I could not understand how that Mandela-talking prince could have superpowers until later it was explained to me his part of Africa was where [the unobtanium](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/12/avatar-movie-review.html) was mined.\u00a0 Then it all made more sense.\n\nOther important plot elements maybe went by in a blur, as I was focusing on the ridiculously-on-steroids cartoon-like physics of it all (Marvel is originally a comic book publisher remember, only recently a studio).\n\nThat's the difference between film in a theater and a Marvel comic:\u00a0 when reading, one may pause to puzzle, even cross-reference and refresh.\u00a0 In a real time first viewing, a lot of information comes at ya, and there's always the risk of dropping some balls.\n\nThat's not as big a deal as it sounds however, as the movie is designed to be rented and/or owned at a later date, and when playing back, even pausing, is OK.\n\nViewing with controls can be a lot more like reading a comic book than taking it in at the theater.\u00a0 The Marvel movie-makers reward those who pay twice: once for the once-through as a blockbuster, and then again for more reflective analysis, in a home theater context.\n\nAnother plot element I didn't quite get is why [the liquid blue stuff](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/08/lucy-movie-review.html) was allowed to travel with Mr. and Mrs. Old Person on some back country road.\u00a0 Is that how we'd treat plutonium?\n\nSome terrorist swoops in and rains on their parade, but what institutional wheel-turning put them alone on a such a desolate road, with such stuff in the trunk in the first place?\u00a0 They might have hit a deer, leaving it to some random hiker to discover the blue liquid's worth on e-Bay.\n\nWhat risk management protocols were being followed?\u00a0 Was this whole operation [ISO-compliant](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/10/starbucks-asylum-district.html)? I guess in 1991 they didn't really have such standards.",
