  "content": "I have newly acquired a taste for Bubble Tea, and have therefore made Fat Straw on Hawthorne a next hangout.\u00a0 They know their process.\u00a0 I'll need to explore more permutations.\n\nThe USPO miss-delivered and envelope so I walked it down to the corner market in question, procuring some drinking supplies, which I made use of on Patrick's porch.\n\nHe's deep into species recognition issues and realizes human eyeballs on the problem, experts identifying known specimens, will help with machine learning.\n\nHis projects could staff an entire company.\u00a0 He tends to work on that scale.\n\nOut of pocket for health insurance in April:\u00a0 $1,313.77 for myself and one dependent.\u00a0 I had to state my case vociferously that March was covered as well.\u00a0 No that's not an April Fools Day joke.\n\n[This posting](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-announce-list/2016-March/011152.html) was though -- a lot less feather-ruffling than last year's post, about an upcoming Pycon in Cuba, which ironically turned out to be true enough.",
