  "content": "Big slow-moving bureaucracies that can't do their own thinking are easy targets for the faster thinkers, human individuals, brains with integrity, geeks or what have you.\n\nThe NSA is easy to crack and spy on, its mostly military-minded leaders none too bright and none too keen on protecting the Constitution, which they most likely know little to nothing about.\n\nGoogle is easy to spy on as well, as is Verizon.\u00a0 These companies have little to no ability to protect against serious investigative reporters, let alone geeks.\n\nThe table-turning [of Wikileaks](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/12/new-years-2013.html) etc. is obvious:\u00a0 the real intelligence community owns the unimaginative bureaucrats, the laughing stock victims of professional spying.\n\nNo, I'm not saying Snowden was a criminal, guilty of espionage.\u00a0 Like [Manning](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/05/approved-long-distance-membership.html), he's a bright kid who wants to uphold and defend democracy.\u00a0 He thinks for himself.\u00a0 Unlike most generals.\n\nSo what do we learn from \"spying\" on [the NSA](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/big-foot-strikes.html): that most of its people are average Americans e.g. they get along to go along and aren't particularly principled.\u00a0 So what else is new?\u00a0\u00a0 The technology is new.\n\nI remember researching \"PGP guy\" ([Zimmermann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy)) versus Bobby Inman (then head of NSA).\u00a0 Should ordinary citizens have a military-grade skill set?\u00a0 The opportunity, the freedom to have that, is what counts.\n\nOrganized government, like organized religion, says no.\u00a0 Who asked them though, right?\n\nAnyway, PGP plays a role in this movie, as does encryption as a general theme.\n\nThis film could be shown in high schools to:\n\n(a) inspire patriotism and respect for geeks and\n(b) motivate more learning of maths, [crypto](http://4dsolutions.net/ocn/clubhouse.html) in particular.\n\nI saw it with Carol and Melody at Living Room Theater #6 in downtown Portland, a couple blocks from the main Powell's.",
