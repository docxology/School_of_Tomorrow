  "content": "\"Bucky stuff\" on CBS Morning Show (2009)\n\nThis well-produced 2009 segment reminds us of the \"Bucky stuff\" focuses on the practical applications of Fuller's ideas, which is not a mistake in any way.\n\nHowever, my \"stridency\" (one might call it) in [my Tweets](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/09/whispering-campaign.html) (can anything called a \"tweet\" be \"strident\"?) stems from the a priori coherence of the unit volume tetrahedron idea.\n\nEven with no practical applications (which it has), there'd be (is) a mathematics here, an approach to spatial geometry, worth passing on.\n\nThe different models of 2nd and 3rd powering, how to map 2x2 and 2x2x2 to respective areas and volumes, are where to start.\u00a0 My Youtube below sets the stage.\u00a0 I continue with the story under the heading of so-called [Martian Math](http://wikieducator.org/Martian_Math) \u2014 one of many ways to go.\n\nAt this point, I'd say some understanding of Synergetics (the name of Fuller's two-volume magnum opus) and its subsequent influence, as well as its influences (what fed into it), are required simply to understand recent intellectual history.\u00a0 Is that kind of history important?\u00a0 To many readers, it still is.\n\n[https://t.co/579yNOJKxu](https://t.co/579yNOJKxu) \u2014 regarding the \"stridency\" of some of my Synergetics tweets.
