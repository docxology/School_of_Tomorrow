  "content": "This almost-two-hour documentary does a marvelous job showing the story from Libby's angle, where the workers gradually put two and two together and realize this deadly asbestos they've been hearing about is actually the stuff they've been mining but branding as vermiculite or something else cute.\u00a0 The stuff is everywhere because for awhile no one thought lung science could possibly matter in the rock business.\u00a0 Kind of like H-bombs can't be bad for ya.\u00a0 Or smoking.\u00a0 Live and learn.\n\nAnyway, what's missing are the board room meetings at [W.R. Grace](https://www.mesotheliomalawyercenter.org/asbestos/manufacturers/w-r-grace-co/) where the limited liability nature of the corporation kicks in.\u00a0 That's what keeps little old ladies from losing their life's savings because some venture goes bad and all the sailors lose their lives at sea.\u00a0 You may not get that box of chocolates, $100 wasted, but if you do, each bonbon will be individually worth $100, the proceeds all yours to keep or divvy among friends per your temperament.\n\nThat was the promise to English nobility:\u00a0 risk ten sheep, reap a fortune, or at worst, lose the ten sheep.\u00a0 No one comes banging on your door for twenty sheep.\u00a0 There's a cap on your liability equal to the amount ventured.\u00a0 That's what Inc. means.\n\nW. R. Grace needed to reallocate resources to selectively bankrupt the Libby subsidiary, then block EPA from locking up lucrative contracts, in case a clean up ever was approved.\u00a0 Meanwhile people were dying but there's no real cure for asbestosis anyway so that was already a write-off.\n\nThese were more good soldiers of capitalism, risking their lives for their labor in their capitalist sea, and reaping the rewards:\u00a0 early death from complications associated with one's job.\u00a0 Grace management died on the line as well, this wasn't just union men.\u00a0 Whole families got it.\u00a0 Asbestos is no joke.",
