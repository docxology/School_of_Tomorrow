  "content": "In the course of discussing Python vs. PHP [last night at Wanderers](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wanderers-20091027.html), someone brought up the fact that the White House has [switched to Drupal](http://radar.oreilly.com/2009/10/whitehouse-switch-drupal-opensource.html), a PHP application.\n\nLikewise the DoD has been [touting open source](http://www.informationweek.com/news/government/enterprise-apps/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=221100039&subSection=All+Stories) as more of an answer to its prayers.  \"Just because a proprietary solution is way more expensive, doesn't mean it's that much better, or even could be worse\" is a message to military intelligence personnel.  Many in the commercial sector have already learned this lesson.\n\nYou might think that all this talk of automating medical records and/or [outcomes research](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/open-source-within-health-care.html) might yield some new open source assets, even outside the [Forge dot mil](http://www.disa.mil/forge/) domain.  If there's tax money involved, then shouldn't the code be of, by and for the people?  [GOSCON](http://goscon.org/) is a traditional forum for such rhetoric, lots of [Portland people](http://site05.goscon.org/panels.html) already on board with that.\n\nSpeaking of Portland, OSCON is [coming back here again](http://ostatic.com/blog/oscon-2010-returning-to-portland-after-brief-jaunt-to-san-jose) next year, after bouncing down to San Jose in 2009.\n\nSlate has been [making fun](http://www.slate.com/id/2233719/) of the WH decision to go with Drupal.  I'm not sure the CIA's use [of Plone](http://www.cmspowered.info/blog/cia) ever got [such attention](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/control-rooms.html).  [NSA](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/other-news-blips.html) put out it's own [SELinux distro](http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2008/03/24/NSA-releases-new-version-of-Linux-software/UPI-99181206371622/) a long time ago, is still putting out new releases, like in March of last year.\n\nThen of course we should remember DARPA's role in [helping Guido](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-developments.html) get IDLE off the ground, a big step in making Computer Programming for Everybody ([CP4E](http://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/)) seem a little bit more real.",
