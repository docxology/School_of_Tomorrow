  "content": "I took Tri-Met today, which got me there with minutes to spare.  It's quite a hike from where 14 leaves me, to Cramer in PSU, but Portland is a smallish town, and I wasn't lugging speakers, nor even a laptop this time.Our main focus today was a somewhat exhaustive investigation into a [simple game framework](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-May/008562.html) I put together since last week, after gauging  student interests and abilities.The emphasis here is on building a reading familiarity with core Python such that slower paced tutorials will already come with some context.We visited [Showmedo](http://showmedo.com/) and watched some of Jeff Rush's [Intro to IPython](http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=CnluURUTV), also [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.org/toc/index.html), and of course the [Python docs](http://www.python.org/doc/) themselves, to prepare them for self-study at whatever rate.I also continued underlining the fact that Python comes in several flavors, including a proprietary version atop Nokia hardware or whatever, all in accordance with its liberal license.[IronPython](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython) and [Jython](http://www.jython.org/Project/index.html) implement the language in C# and Java respectively.  Stay tuned for more options.I also explained how I use Python in my own case professionally, sometimes to study the [geometry of geodesics](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2137134480771470882), per [stickworks.py](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/stickworks.html) and [polyhedra.py](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/polyhedra.py) -- my [4dsolutions.net stuff](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html) will remain at their disposal, as adventures continue.",
