  "content": "The girls and I projected this on our living room wall, using the Toshiba + Optoma. Alexia fell asleep before it was over, Tara pronounced it a good movie and not all that bad, given she empathized so completely with Ofelia. Dawn had wanted to see this movie, given the title and buzz. In retrospect, we think she did fine without it -- but not that it was a bad movie or anything, just very violent (recalling her reaction to [Lost City](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/lost-city-movie-review.html)). Plus Dawn didn't much go for subtitles.The film explores very strongly motivated characters each responding to a different set of cues. The little girl is the most off base, in terms of having a solid enough reality to walk through walls (in a manner of speaking). The military patriarch is self-indulging in some father-son cult that glorifies in death, and he ends up disappointed. In between is the [Spanish civil war](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/dj-vu.html), more than ugly. The maid's scenario is the most heroic, next to Ofelia's, yet tinged with more realism (more machine world, less [Narnia](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/chronicles-of-narnia-lww-movie-review.html)).",
