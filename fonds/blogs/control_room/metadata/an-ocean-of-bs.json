How reassuring, right?\u00a0 But wait, don't [The Americans](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/04/the-americans-movie-review.html) (deep cover spies in a fiction TV series) speak like perfect American?\u00a0 \u00a0Maybe we're not out of the woods yet!\n\nOn the positive side, we have evil Russians (connected to the cyber-caliphate and ISIS) maybe tilting Superman's election without firing a shot.\n\nThey promised us we'd be entering a world wherein cyber war and cyber weapons would be the new big thing.\u00a0 As a Quaker, that sounded like a step away from [doofus muggle](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/pandering-to-muggles-editorial.html) outward weapons, so I haven't necessarily put up a lot of resistance.\n\nLets make the endless wars all cyber for a change, more like the computer games we grow up on.\u00a0 Given the hell hole in which we started, that'd definitely be big progress!\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_mgUyN9ue_frLkeTPBDFYo04rMdV8wa0buLbYjB_cXj2SVwjM-k36DZXkBHKnPc9NGArKAmX6mlVgd2-peRYlfbV4WN_XL7e8JheRgmqQtjBe9IU7V9zM6m3prKnllX3X-_hL/s1600/fancybear.jpeg)",
