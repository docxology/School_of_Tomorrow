Or I might choose to watch it, and I watch the whole thing.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThose are two singularities in a way: tuning in, and ignoring; remembering and forgetting.\u00a0 Taking it, or leaving it.\n\nIn between, come the numbers between 1 and 1.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf I have 2 things, I have the option of choosing either, bracketed by choosing none and choosing all. 1 2 1.\n\nIf I have 3 things (picture a triangle), I have the option of choosing them one at a time (3), in pairs (3), bracketed by none (1 way to choose) and all (1 way to choose). 1 3 3 1.\n\nIf I have 4 things (picture a tetrahedron), I have the option of choosing them one at a time (4 vertices V),\n in pairs (6 edges E), three at a time (4 faces F) bracketed by none and all. 1 4 6 4 1. V + F = E + 2.\n\nIf I have 5 things (picture a tetrahedron with an added center point), I have the option of choosing them one at a time (5),\n in pairs (10), in sets of 3 (4 external facets + 6 internal vanes = 10), in sets of 4 (5 - always leaving one out).\u00a0 None and all.\u00a0 1 5 10 10 5 1.\u00a0\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBZQucmzZqT5Uz3ULNVXRlV2FINT30Jj5h4rMiGu1GpXAjxFQW58_0oSL2qri2_8dBUlmyDHIqeozcU0JRT8Q5lkg3Ua97Q3oWU_fls1F4VwgfzN-MYfPF9JS15TWeFfv_znrPKnVssCcGcZp0A_Fhkvoa_LCsCPj6u79XmB8h9bcTPQ6tizcd/s180/4spokes.gif)\n\nIf I have 6 things (picture a full octahedron), I have the option of choosing them one at a time (6),\n in pairs (15), in sets of 3 (20), in sets of 4 (15), in sets of 5 (6), bracketed by none and all. 1 6 15 20 15 6 1.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhuM0Wa80ZZJ2jB6MJuIz97I6wJUMwpesEiSM01RKEz2UKQgXyG0sEEn5hPbBrFYCUaAUf2nD5QYonSVHrHruAZ7_aCq1GjrPULxCY31i3ROMAI-_u9pi7oMgyooJv2PTuqPQhqxQcDEeVKHCbJGVTLH4GbGIESLjTWrh3q03KPqbk57IDAT34_/s195/6spokes.gif)\n\nNo news here. These are the rows of Pascal's Triangle and a verbalization of the combinatorics involved in selecting k items from n.\u00a0 What we're adding is a cloud of points but with structure (triangle, tetrahedron, half octahedron, octahedron...).\u00a0 But look how the octahedron suggests more pairs than just its 12 edges. We have those connections directly across, pole to pole, XYZ, giving 15 total.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh638JfEvgvd0t-GAksbMyzq0xf6ezs3Rhs_ltxmfOmpCN8Nj-nzX56e9eymFHzavluIYwuxiH27K9RA7micAOyTZuVoD2Md9c0mbLvxcSBHYCJ5Cdu4-dIXAJ-ya9pRLvO951JpAr1RAe_JzF4Lf7zMRF1sUAYja1OhFPq5_8uw0xm1COPUKWT/s448/Screen%20Shot%202023-08-09%20at%201.51.20%20PM.png)\n\nWhen we get to a half octahedron (an alternative to a tetrahedron with a vertex in the middle), we already have pairs (defining edges) that aren't edges in the original figure, meaning two square diagonals. 4 (to apex) + 4 (around the base) + 2 (crisscross) = 10.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWith the full octahedron, we have surface edges (4 + 4 + 4 = 12) but also the internal XYZ segments. 12 + 3 = 15.\n\nOrganizing the point cloud up through a cube (8 things) has its charm but I see no benefit from scaling the ladder of Euclidean dimensions as we go down the rows, talking about polytopes. n-D polytopes are pretentious at this juncture in my view, adding too much unnecessary overhead.\n\nReading right to left on each row is about how many things to omit.\u00a0 Keep all but one in exactly as many ways as choosing one.\u00a0 Keeping all but two gives the same number as choosing only two.\u00a0 Hence the symmetry. Complementary readings.\n\nThe 2nd row, two ones, is a \"take it or leave it\" just like the other rows.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWith the top row, of one alone, there's no taking and no leaving.\u00a0 There's no \"or\" and no \"and\".\n\n\"Realization of otherness\" (awareness) begets the 2nd row, as now the observer has separated from the observed and has the \"take it or leave it\" option.\u00a0 The option to simply ignore and forget does not materialize in the \"only one\" world of complete unconsciousness.\n\nThe observer, growing down through successive rows as experience multiplies, never loses the freedom to be choosy, once that light comes on.\nWhen we get to a half octahedron, we already have pairs (defining edges) that aren't edges in the original figure, meaning two square diagonals. 4 (to apex) + 4 (around the base) + 2 (crisscross) = 10.\u00a0 With the full octahedron, we have surface edges (4 + 4 + 4 = 12) but also the internal XYZ segments. 12 + 3 = 15.\nOrganizing the point cloud up through a cube (8 things) has its charm but I see no benefit from scaling the ladder of Euclidean dimensions as we go down the rows, talking about polytopes. n-D polytopes are pretentious at this juncture in my view, adding too much unnecessary overhead.\n\nReading right to left on each row is about how many things to omit.\u00a0 Keep all but one in exactly as many ways as choosing one.\u00a0 Keeping all but two gives the same number as choosing only two.\u00a0 Hence the symmetry.
