But then I right away have to walk that back, as the Statue of Liberty beckons and it's built into the\u00a0warp and weave of the nation that this is a place for \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\u00a0Come here and resettle. Uncle Sam needs you.\n\nThat message keeps changing over the years. Come pick our fruit but don't expect to be treated much above the slave level, meaning you will need to stay undocumented so we might keep our 2nd tier of exploitable labor.\u00a0 We'll kick you out when we feel like it.\u00a0 Sorry, we got here first.\n\nIf you switch lenses and see \"going west\" as adding to the \"refugee bucket\", then the whole saga of spreading westward, coast to coast, was the Refugee Biz in action.\u00a0 Which is not to say they couldn't be enslaved or conscripted, forced into indentured servitude, onto poor farms or whatever.\n\nOnce you remember the role the military plays, of warehousing and disciplining scads of men, turning them into fine specimens, and once you see military types as socialists escaping capitalism, i.e. as economic refugees, then the \"refugee biz\" takes on its more monstrous proportions, size-wise.\u00a0 The refugee biz is still the biz then. Makes sense: providing refuge.\n\nHowever, too much focus on the economic component leaves too many stories untold.\u00a0 People come to the Americas to get lost, to escape being found, to start over, to gain a clean slate. Providing asylum.\n\nWhen I see the impressive ability of Chinese crews to crank out whole cities in China, I go back to Old Man River, the stadium-shaped city that dwarfs a real stadium.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot as dense as a Paolo Soleri perhaps, but certainly a real city, like a crater, not necessarily sprawling.\u00a0 It could be surrounded by a wilderness, with a few roads and train tracks coming and going. Canals.\n\nOne could build a few to get the hang of it, e.g. do the \"movie set\" version. Make some cartoons. Script the project. Do a few smaller ones? Perhaps we already have?\u00a0 Do stadiums count?\n\nThe Americans would add more aerospace, continuing to take these new designs to the next level of ephemeralization.\n\nBy the way, I currently know next to nothing about \"fifteen minute cities\" although I've heard the meme.\u00a0 Does that mean it takes no more than 15 minutes to get from any point to any point within the city?\u00a0 Is that on foot or by Segway?\u00a0 Like a Florida mobile home park but with more amenities?\n\nI do imagine an OMR would have like trains or monorails, like we have\u00a0at the bigger airports. \u00a0Individualized people movers (driverless)? Who has the best storyboards?",
