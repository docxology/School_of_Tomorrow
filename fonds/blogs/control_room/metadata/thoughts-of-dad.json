  "content": "This is the anniversary of my parents' terrible car accident on the highway from Maseru to Bloemfontein, in the Orange Free State, in the year 2000.[Jack](http://grunch.net/4dsolutions/jackbio.html) was a fantastic dad, showed me the world, and a way of living in it.  I'm not a clone or even a close copy, but some of the character traits I like best about myself I attribute to his example and parenting.  Our whole family was impressed with this man, and were very sorry to lose him so suddenly that day.We are grateful [mom](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/through-needles-eye.html) survived the accident and thrived in future chapters.  We thank the rescue medics and health care providers of Bloemfontein for their professionalism.  The engineering community building the dam in Maseru, the diplomatic community, Quakers, friends of the family, all provided support as Julie and I helped with Carol's recovery.",
