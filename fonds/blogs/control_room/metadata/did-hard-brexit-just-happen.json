  "content": "The seizure of an Iranian oil tanker, bound for a non-EU country, seems enormously egregious to a lot of people, Europeans especially.\u00a0 People remember when England and the USA formed alliances to relive colonial dreams of empire, pretty recently, and resent being abused as a consequence.\n\nThe warmongers in Britain may have miscalculated however, as there's no momentum for war with Iran, given the mainstream media no longer has a grip on the North American psychology.\n\nA tiny oligarchy of dim bulbs may entertain the fantasy that owning media is their ticket to glory, but that's far from clear at this point.\n\nWhat was NATO's role in all this?\u00a0 The \"coalition\" since the invasion of Iraq under Bush 2 has been steadily shrinking.\u00a0 Invading Iraq was seen as momentous and Europe had to be on board.\u00a0 Attacking Iran is more the senile fantasy of nursing home candidates and their moneyed friends.\u00a0 There's little patience, including in the armed forces, for dunderhead bosses.\n\nWhere does the White House come out in the wash?\u00a0 Trump seems to agree [with Tucker](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2019/07/more-on-current-events.html) about the tapeworm infestation.\u00a0 He played his usual role in the speech-making, but when there's no last minute save-the-day diplomacy opportunity, as in the case of the DPRK, he tends to lose interest.\n\nIran has chosen the safest course for itself:\u00a0 denounce nuclear weaponry, but make clear there's no deal if the EU can't live up to its side.\u00a0 The EU is calculating furiously, wondering if it needs to stay on the far right, with the warmongers.\u00a0 The unilateral seizure of the supertanker may have tipped the scales.\u00a0 The Brits are no longer welcome members.\u00a0 They're too into reckless spazing out.\n\nPeople question Trump's sanity and he's able to take the brunt, by staying outrageous.\u00a0 Bolton's sanity is more tender.\u00a0 They say he's heartless, but is he also mindless?\u00a0 That does seem likely at the moment.\u00a0 I've done some more commentary on Youtube.\n\nI realize \"hard Brexit\" means something else to most people.\u00a0 My angle is psychological.\u00a0 The EU is now sufficiently alienated to be glad of Britain's leaving.\u00a0 But where will Britain go?\u00a0 The island won't budge.",
