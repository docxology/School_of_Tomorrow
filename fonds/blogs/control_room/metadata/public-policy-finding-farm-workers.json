  "content": "Although [Glenn](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/a-flextegrity-story.html) grew up in a union family, amidst other union families, he came to see the downside of unions as well.\u00a0 I learned more of his story this afternoon.\n\nHis decision to quit the electricians union in Phoenix is what ultimately led to his joining the Navy and enrolling in [the Defense Language Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Language_Institute) in Monterey.\n\nThe theme of our discussion: the [looming agricultural crisis](http://www.oregonlive.com/business/index.ssf/2017/04/oregon_farmers_scrambling_as_l.html) as states scramble to find farm workers.\n\nThe clamp down on itinerant field workers is endangering vast resources, from vineyards to asparagus patches.\u00a0 Picture acres and acres of rotting onions, potatoes, you name it.\n\nMight states start up their own Guest Worker programs independently of the Feds?\u00a0 What unions might get involved, if any?\n\nCould we use smartphone apps to help workers find opportunities?\u00a0 The same apps might help farm managers find help.\n\nGiven we live near Cesar E. Chavez Avenue, the newer name for SE 39th, it makes some sense we'd be wondering about United Farm Workers and so on.\u00a0 What's the history at least?\n\nGlenn dove into Wikipedia as a start.\n\nThe Institute for Science, Engineering and Public Policy provided the impetus, and meeting place, for Wanderers in the first place.\n\nThat some of us would be focused on the impending farm worker shortage certainly stands to reason.",
