  "content": "I'm not the first one to comment on all the mirroring that goes on. They're saying the GOP is rallying around opening an impeachment inquiry because Ukraine i.e. because the first impeachment inquiry against their guy was with reference to a phone call between the White House and president Zelenskyy in Kiev.\u00a0\n\nSo now it's tit for tat, quid pro quo etc., in going after Hunter & Co. on possible bribery charges (in which the current US president might be implicated).\n\nThe symmetry is not yet complete however. The GOP has yet to turn Russiagate backlash (from the base) into RICO charges centered around the conduct of Michael Morell and his project to make the Biden laptop story seem to be Russian misinfo, even when the FBI (and presumably the CIA) already knew better.\u00a0\n\nThere's a similar pattern of willfully acting with intent, in the face of being told otherwise by people in a position to know.\n\nPer Dershowitz, once the parties start using RICO against each other, the public perception, that politics = racketeering, comes too close to the surface for comfort. People get reminded of their own suspicions, in seeing them confirmed.\n\nThe comedians start having a field day mixing the criminality of high society into the mainstream narrative, ala White House meets Heisenberg of Breaking Bad. That's an edgy genre that sells tickets.\n\nMore puzzle pieces swirl in the popular mind already, most importantly VIPS (Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity) which gets connected to the Guccifer story, ala Fancy Bear. That's been a topic in these blogs as well.\n\nSafe to say, reviewing Russiagate in earnest is going to be a big topic going into 2024, as Americans try to process to what extent they've been lied to about this that and the other. Always a challenge. We tend to rely on help from those radio voices as we drive to and from work and/or work from home. The echo chambers and think tanks process differently.",
