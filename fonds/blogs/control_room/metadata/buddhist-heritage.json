They need each other too much to ever come apart, even conceptually.\n\nThis ain't the first time I've practiced tilting at the \"3D windmill\" and indeed I've squandered many hours investigating \"dimension talk\" under different lighting.\u00a0 This was the first time I fashioned a link to a core Buddhist concept perhaps.\u00a0 I'm wondering what the consequences will be.\n\nI told the Meeting guy that I'd dutifully appeared for a follow-up doc appointment today, only to discover I was a week early.\u00a0 There's nothing especially urgent about my medical condition at this point, so I'm content to wait.\u00a0 \"Expectant waiting\" Quakers say, as they sit in stillness, waiting for the future to be revealed.\u00a0 We know it will be.\n\nLast night I taught my Python class for four hours, then stayed up reading more Dahlstrom (English professor, WW1 memoirs) and Sloterdijk (German philosopher).\u00a0 Today I teach another Python class, only for an hour, to some eager middle schoolers.\u00a0 I need to drive to that one.\n\nWeeks ago, I'd notice huffing and puffing a lot more, walking from my parked car, up the hill to the public school.\u00a0 Shortness of breath had become an issue.\u00a0 I was monitoring, but not making the requisite appointments for a professional diagnosis.\n\nDelay is want landed me in the ER. The upside of that strategy is I got a lot of state of the art treatment in one fell swoop.\u00a0 At this point, shortness of breath is not an issue.\u00a0 I even ran a few blocks, not a problem, trying not to be late to my non-existent appointment.\n\nToday I spent a lot of time listening to [Marshall McLuhan related tapes](https://youtu.be/t6HyFyMjlXA), or watching videos of the man.\u00a0 He talked a lot about television and its impact, in an age before the Internet, which latter is a synergy of TV and telephone.\u00a0 Telephone is point-to-point whereas TV was at first broadcast.\u00a0 Nowadays we \"dial in\" to get our media \"on demand\".\n\nCo-dependent origination is a broad concept, saying basically nothing has \"self nature\" in terms of existing wholly self-sufficiently, independently of all else.\n\nOur accepted orthodoxy in mathematics is that height, width and depth are independent dimensions that may be conceived of in isolation.\u00a0 No one seriously questions this dogma, including me, as I recognize the utility of XYZ.\u00a0 That doesn't mean we're prevented from conceiving alternatives.",
