  "content": "I was reminiscing with [Suzanne](http://www.tendreams.org/varo.htm) about [Election Night 2008](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/ieee-presentation.html), when I descended to a subterranean vault, cut off from media, with a gaggle of engineers and their families, lay people.\n\nPortland Center Stage had canceled the performance in the main theater, given an inability to compete with the Election Night circus, but the Bucky play people had a different idea:\u00a0 lets woo engineers, give 'em a special invitation and free IEEE lecture [by Kirby](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7919479).\u00a0 This demographic is likely enough to fill the theater, even on such a momentous evening.\n\nThe plan worked, plus we had plenty of access to media during intermission.\u00a0 Upon emerging from the vault, the race had been called.\n\nLast night was a little different.\u00a0 I had some really spicy foods with a friend (Cibo's last time), foods a biased person might say were \"unAmerican\" (e.g jellyfish -- as if McDonalds set the standard), but there's nothing unAmerican about Chinese American.\n\nI was more than tongue in cheek about suggesting some [collaboration around railroads](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7914083) in North America.\u00a0 Yes, there's lots of history there, not all of it pleasant.\u00a0 We would study that.\u00a0 Future work on railroads is more [for academic credit](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/03/work-study-programs.html) than in the old days.\u00a0 You might get a history degree, while keeping those triceps less flabby, or a systems science degree (so many trajectories).\n\nDinner conversation ranged through many topics but I found myself strangely attracted to some Quaker threads I've been exploring.\u00a0 The new gigabytes include a documentary on the Bonus Army, which connects to Smedley \"fighting Quaker\" Butler and the Business Plot.\n\nAs I was telling Wanderers even later that same evening, I need to dig up Human Smoke (the book).\u00a0 Quakers play a starring role in this history, as hoping to prevent a war it seemed just about everyone wanted.\u00a0 How can people spoil for death and mayhem?\u00a0 That's a \"gateway question\" into the Jungian world of [AVP](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/10/alternatives-to-violence-avp.html) and the unity of opposites.\n\nQuakers are respectful of the power of archetypes (like Tantrics in that way).\u00a0 We speak of \"outward weapons\" knowing that connotes \"inward weapons\" in complement.\u00a0 Where there are weapons, there are connotations of war, like smoke goes with fire.\u00a0 A war with [inward weapons](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/11/seven-psychopaths-movie-review.html) is variously named PsyWar, Lambs War, Jihad... Dharma depending who's on the other end of the line.\n\nA new mattress for Carol is on order.\u00a0 Her bed is electric / adjustable, but is not a hospital bed.\n\nLindsey was in a reflective mood when I came back from Wanderers, listening to election results on FM radio.\u00a0 That Washington State, [right over the bridge](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/gis-2009.html), had legalized gay marriage and more adult access to ingestable hemp products proved that Canadian thinking was encroaching southward.\n\nOregon is \"the south\" of the Pacific Northwest, according to a well placed analyst.\n\nWhen it comes to hemp, illegality amounts to funding for public sector jobs and higher prices to growers both.\u00a0 Some of California's bigger growers are afraid of change on the same score.\u00a0 Who wants to jeopardize the market value of a major cash crop?\u00a0 Drug lords profit from Drug Wars (a truism) at the expense of everyone else sometimes.\u00a0 Prohibition means full prisons and prison labor.\n\nThe Chinese should boycott anything tainted with US prison labor behind it, as a WTO violation.\u00a0 The AFL/CIO should get on board with that one.\u00a0 Prison labor anywhere is a threat to labor everywhere.\n\nGay marriage is an easy extension of the boilerplate and adds business for lawyers and divorce courts, more reality television.\n\nStraying from the nuclear model (two partners) is harder in \"dom rel\" and I've suggested more feasible in business law (households as \"companies\").\u00a0 The conservative evangelicals have a lot more interest in alternative \"Biblical lifestyles\" so the \"company of companions\" model is less likely to prove as culturally divisive as gay marriage is/was.\n\nI agree with Ashton that literate adults have more leeway these days to hammer out their own agreements, not taking all their cues from boilerplate.\u00a0 Kids will need more anthropological and sociological savvy to describe their households during Show & Tell (lightning talks).\n\nTeasing junior because he has two dads and one mom won't seem so rewarding when there's no taint of scandal or closeted skeletons. \u00a0 Best to look for other buttons to push then (junior's lunch box sure looks dumb).",
