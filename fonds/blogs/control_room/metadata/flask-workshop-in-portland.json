  "content": "I spent much of the day geeking out with peers at what was billed as intermediate Python level, a dive into a 3rd party micro-web-framework named Flask.\u00a0 We had the good fortune to be taught by the new O'Reilly author, [Miguel Grinberg](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/), software engineer and film maker.\u00a0 He'll be presenting this tutorial at Pycon later this month in Montreal and was eager for a dry run or dress rehearsal one might call it.\u00a0 That was great for us, with Idealist sponsoring with catered tamales, a very generous number.\u00a0 Urban Airship provided facilities in this building used by our wind energy sector (windmills).\n\nWhen you feed an http request to a Flask framework, it routes to functions with URL bits available as arguments.\u00a0 The functions usually prepare a response object that goes back to the client browser.\u00a0 What happens in between (between the ears of the web service) is what we call the application, and Flask is merely a framework, like clay.\u00a0 Miguel had shaped it into a password protected service that had login, cookies, database access, email, iconic \"gravatars\", the whole nine yards.\u00a0 He really touched on a lot of deep features, not dumbing it down for us, yet keeping it moving.\u00a0 The applause was sincere, and for Flask as well i.e. I think we appreciated its straightforward yet powerful design.\n\nI'm not seeing web frameworks, even just those within the Python sphere, as being at each others' throats in some Wild Kingdom, narrated by some gringo, sponsored by whatever insurance company.\u00a0 It's not a Darwinian circus.\n\nWe're talking more like models of airplane, with Django more heavy / commercial, geared stereotypically for newspaper sites (which covers many cases) and Flask more the ultralight, with many frameworks in between like web2py.\n\nJinja2 is a sophisticated templating engine.\n\nThe back end might be PostgreSQL with postGIS options enable.\n\nSo in calling Flask \"ultra-light\" I'm not suggesting it's under-powered (you sit it behind Apache probably), just simple enough to wrap a lot of power tools and get them working together in a manner that pleases at least some web developers.\n\nYou can even just use it locally on your own machine, why not?\u00a0 Play on some, work on others.\n\nBy the way, lest events overtake me, allow me to put a stub link here (in my own blog), Wiki style, to a post I want to write about the most recent Thirsters gathering on East Broadway.\u00a0 There's an idealist theme connecting them.\n\nI was greatly encouraged to learn more about how anthropologists are conducting themselves these days, [adding to my respect](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/04/roller-coaster-at-reed.html) of that profession and its ethics.\u00a0 We had some Reed faculty present, at least one, and Forest Service, not sure what other government agencies.\n\nOur topic was relations with \"first peoples\" as we might call them, descendents of earlier waves of migrants, going back some 10K years.\u00a0 There's no sense in which \"the Indians were all wiped out\" and live on only in museums and interpretive centers.\u00a0 To think that way is to live in deep ignorance.\u00a0 However, I do understand where someone living in present day (2014) Philadelphia might get that impression.",
