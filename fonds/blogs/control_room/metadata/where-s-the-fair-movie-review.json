  "content": "[Where's the Fair?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2415482/) asks why the USA no longer seems to care about the World's Fair or Expo concept, having withdrawn from the international body that plans them while producing only lackluster pavilions and then only when goaded by foreign governments to step up to the plate.\n\nTalking heads propose various theories as to why the State and/or Commerce Department have dropped the ball, while the Freedom of Information Act begets a lot of heavily redacted documents.\u00a0 No one seems to know for sure.\n\nThe film spends very little time on the Montreal dome of 1967, Buckminster Fuller's contribution, and mentions Kabul and Khrushchev not at all.\u00a0 Minus the Bucky thread, perhaps too much of [the narrative](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2666220) unravels?\n\nWashington does not want to get trapped into doing another dome probably, while winning hearts and minds is an undertaking that city despairs of doing anymore, having alienated just about everyone.\u00a0 \n\nThe confidence to spin truly hopeful visions of the future is not in the USIA's repertoire anymore, as there's [no longer a USIA](http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2013/0105/bk/book02_dillen_usia.html). \n\nI learned quite a bit from this film.\u00a0 I had no idea Spokane, Washington had hosted a World's Fair in the 1970s, or maybe I'd known that once and forgot.\u00a0\u00a0 Archival clips from some of the events were exciting.\n\nPerhaps the USA is just too diverse to be represented by some out of touch State Department in any case.\u00a0 Cascadia could have its own pavilion someday maybe?\u00a0 GM did, in Shanghai in 2010, with its Chinese partner company.\n\nMilan 2015 will be the site of the next Expo.\u00a0 The documentary suggests the USA will not have a pavilion but from the perspective of December 2014, we [do expect one](http://www.usapavilion2015.net/).\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg3D6H4uPpOhN4EmRDbxaaqITZg1fJ1Ym5Z2rNmg8ZCcRLTV0Tbn2YPFBgIQ-WcqShSX-l_tEmA3Rw6prVlCLHI96AVZgAEFEIEz9z1LB9jJcr9b-AuwQMwRfOZAlmX7kHTmyzN/s1600/pavilion-side.jpg)\n\n:: rendering:\u00a0 usa pavilion 2015 ::\n\nFollowup proposal:\n[A possible food candidate](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2665156) for the American Food Pavilion",
