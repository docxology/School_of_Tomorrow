  "content": "What's become clear is the role of politicians in major media is to accelerate what look to be retaliatory measures against evildoers, but in a conditioned reflex kind of way.\n\nDoing the Sherlock Holmes thing, where you investigate deeply, is a civilian police kind of response. One gets detectives on the case.\u00a0 That's not the way to get wars started.\u00a0 People need to be in an obedient mood, willing to have their judgements pre-digested.\u00a0 Investigations are inconvenient, to say the least.\n\nRush to Judgement theater looks very scripted and the onlooker extras, the people in the stands, are just expected to cheer or boo.\u00a0 They're not given time to really study the issues or evidence, or form an opinion.\u00a0 Conversation and comparing notes is not important.\n\nEver since Hunger Games and other literacy campaigns, the spectators have become familiar with the fact that war depends on deception, as well as surprise.\n\nA significant minority no longer thinks exactly as they're programmed to think.\u00a0 When the media overplays its hand, they create another wave of thinkers who don't believe in immediate responses ala Pavlov.\n\nI think the programmer war planners consider themselves very clever and put a lot of faith in their own ability to manipulate public opinion.\u00a0 I'm not sure this hubris is justified, what with the credibility of warmongers already so exhausted, so stretched to the breaking point.\n\nTheir threats start to sound shrill and hysterical, as if they themselves don't believe them.\n\nAnyone who thinks a massive bombing campaign is somehow the right response to any crime whatsoever is suffering from terminal ignorance.\u00a0 But then we pay taxes to cover the paychecks of such people.\u00a0 They get what amounts to welfare to hold their desk jobs.\u00a0 Will they actually learn on the job and become less pathetic?\u00a0 That's doubtful.\n\nI'm going ahead with [my Trucker Exchange Program](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/a-trucker-exchange-program-part-one-247acdfdd897) as these devastated cities in the Middle East, if they're to recover at all, will do so thanks to lots of trucking.\u00a0 I don't need to leave my post to spell out the concepts and widen the circle of readers.\u00a0 Did I mention [academic credit](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/tourism-for-academic-credit-9a5524dbb24) will be involved?",
