  "content": "I think a better way to teach Greek mythology to today's high schoolers might be to use the analogy of a mixing board and/or a multi-track editing system.Each god or goddess gets a track, and it's a matter of compensating, perhaps overcompensating, swinging the pendulum back, continuing to accommodate what Neoplatonists later called the Holy Spirit, or just Spirit if you didn't see the need for a qualifier.Many philosophers like to say [Zeitgeist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist) instead, given their Germanic heritage and/or distrust of people who say \"holy\" for a living (an old \"stones & glass houses\" story, still plagues Old Europe).Then you had [these cults](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119282/) around each deity, basically ad agencies, PR firms, think tanks.  On the ground, there'd be a war, like with the Trojans or something, Persians whatever.Outward wars tend to be sick and twisted by definition according to my own [Quaker F&P](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/12/quaker-infrastructure.html), so what's called for is therapy, and physicians with a sense of social responsibility.You figure out what remix will maybe help restore peace and prosperity and lead to happier, more liberating pursuits and co-venturing.In a modern context, for me, that'd mean more Athena and less idiocy, like I've been in this [cult of Athena](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/temple-to-athena.html) for some time now, duh.  We have a longstanding alliance with the cult of Apollo, lots of other details I could go into, but why let the competition in on our secrets right?",
