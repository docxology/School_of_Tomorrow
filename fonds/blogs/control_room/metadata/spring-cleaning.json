  "content": "I remarked favorably on the junk service guy's shoulder tatoo, calling it a Celtic knotted snake. He cited [Neverending Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088323/) but also liked it for it's allusive similarity to the \"mind of the Buddha\" endless knot motif; he'd noticed, walking through our house, a lot of cool Tantric stuff.\nAnyway, the two of 'em hauled off $239's worth of stuff by volume, including a wrecked electric lawn mower, destroyed portable A/C unit, and a much-abused double-sized heated waterbed from our basement. \n\nI'd scored this latter when the Braithwaite's, hoping to relocate to Canada, offered it to our family. If I'd had my act more together -- was more of a handyman -- it might've provided a cool place to cop some Z's or otherwise loll. My bad that it never happened.At first Tara didn't like this placement (below) for this bumper sticker, but I pointed out it is stuck to the bumper, just in a weird place. David Nally suggested we could put a Keep Portland Insane sticker right on the windshield -- smart cookie that David. Hillary made us some dinner tonight.",
