Chandy and I are digging through old management theories and philosophies, looking for what passes for \"mind maps\" in today's K-12 edu-speak.We're in agreement that time isn't the only important dimension, and that [GST (general systems theory)](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstwork.html) has some kind of handle on that fact.Beyond that, it's unclear if we have the makings of a collaboration here.Philosophically, it sounds like we're both advocating a less sequential design, when it comes to curriculum, but with attention to coherence and relatedness nonetheless, i.e. not wasting students' time is an over-arching goal (doesn't mean student won't waste their own time, but that comes more under the heading of \"live and learn\" i.e. there's really no substitute for personal experience sometimes).In a [Synergetics-informed view](http://http//www.grunch.net/synergetics/), \"mind maps\" tend to \"connect around in all circumferential directions\" i.e. we don't sketch our networks on a flat expanse of desert, but on a desert planet (but with [lots of CamelCase](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/etcha-sketch-view.html), either way).",
