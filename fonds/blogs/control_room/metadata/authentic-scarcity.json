  "content": "I've continued [my conversations with ISEPP](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/04/thermodynamics-earth-energy-budget.html) about World Game, which I use in its original sense of working to make sense of the world and to strategize accordingly.\u00a0 War Game is similar, with the overhead of trashing infrastructure, destroying muscle mass, deliberately making things worse and weaker, in order to improve matters.\u00a0 Yes, that's counter-intuitive I fully realize.\n\nDr. Charles Hall is typical of a trending cast of professionals trained in the natural sciences willing to raise their voices against conventional economics.\u00a0 He's an emeritus who doesn't need to worry about ruffling feathers.\u00a0 Those still striving for tenure or simply wishing for a modicum of job security, maybe can't afford to be so outspoken.\n\n\"Biophysical Economics\" means taking science seriously and thinking more realistically about energy budgets and the thermodynamics of it all.\n\nMy focus on [the PWS](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/asynchronous-learning-engine-ale.html) (personal workspace) anticipates when the \"daily commute\" (a sloshing back and forth of a billion vehicles) will give way to people tightening their radius and watching more Netflix.\u00a0 Families will have more together time.\u00a0 Can that be all bad?\u00a0 Telecommuting beats clogging the freeways.\u00a0 Or look at how we bus kids to school when the best teachers are on Youtube, better viewed from one's PWS.\n\nHow many humans might we support via theme parks?\u00a0 Or call them EPCOTs.\u00a0 They want their driverless cars and HDTVs.\u00a0 They want novelty, family life, fresh produce.\u00a0 What if your greenhouse and your house were part of the same climate controlled structure?\u00a0 Remember the [argon gas and Tefzel pillows](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/about-habitats.html)?\u00a0 Has Silicon Valley improved on the Whole Earth Catalog?\n\nSuppose you had a warehouse with a pile of Soylent delivered by dump truck every few months.\u00a0 Just add water.\u00a0 No it's not made from people.\u00a0 It's not like eating in a French restaurant, but at least you won't starve.\u00a0 They're basically paying you to stay healthy.\u00a0 You cost more when you're sick.\u00a0 Breathing takes work.\u00a0 That's physics.\n\nPeople work their whole lives to afford spacious homes and then leave them empty, to sit in offices and cubicles all day, playing the game of who's boss.\u00a0 Don't tell me this isn't crazy, in light of the precious fossil fuels we're squandering for the privilege.\u00a0 I'm not defending this species as rational.\u00a0 Like any dumb animal, they're not likely to change their ways until they come up against an electric fence.\n\nSome folks believe in morphogenetic fields, or lets just talk about the Zeitgeist, or Holy Ghost in Catholic spheres.\u00a0 Princeton was full of talk about the noosphere when I was there in the 1970s.\u00a0 We put some faith in our collective wisdom, and intuition.\u00a0 New England Transcendentalism went that route, more Aquarian Conspiracy.\u00a0 But putting faith in something doesn't keep Planet of the Apes from dominating the programming.",
