  "content": "You need to go back a ways in USA corporate culture, to find much [happy days futurism](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJjUVIIYptE) as a genre. The later science fiction is more [Mad Max](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082694/), one of Dawn's favorites, darker and edgy.But [American Look](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498986/) is unrelentingly upbeat, produced by Chevrolet in the late 1950s, a tribute to America's designers, or stylists as they were often then called.The camera hovers lovingly over those mod lines we still admire today, though more as retro [chachkas](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chachkas) for Church of Elvis type palaces, with [Austin Powers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/) shag rugs.Those perky percolators, those adorable Stepford Wives, with their modest almost ankle-length dresses (unless water skiing or sun bathing, or showing off motor vehicles). Those swoopy pencil sharpeners, those cute streamlined telephones (still rotary dial)...Per [recent anthropological studies](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/cry-baby-movie-review.html), some teenagers were actually cultivating the more juvenile delinquent look back then, in a still hush hush rebellion of Drapes (underdogs) versus Squares (on top).  Later we'd get [The Beatles](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/us-versus-john-lennon-movie-review.html) and all that loud music.However, our avuncular, all-knowing narrator is undeterred by these troubling signs of a brewing culture war, and simply reminds us ([again and again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQK5J8bYYFA)) how lucky we are to be ([white](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/03/hairspray-movie-review.html)) Americans (no Negroes in this film, nor any of [their music](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/napoleon-dynamite-movie-review.html)).Women get nodding acceptance as stylists until we get to the Inner Sanctum, where [Bob](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/decoding-usa-culture.html) appears.  Bob smokes a pipe, and his team of men in black, his no nonsense yes men, are anxious to please.They go off to make a car out of clay, a Chevrolet.  They then stroke it and worship it, and when [Bob](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/easy-does-it-movie-review.html) reappears, he is pleased.This is really the climax of the film, but we take awhile to wind down after that, have a cig maybe, look at those percolators some more.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEijLrH-2eDOkt4xu-lwOVQK75Knr1jpyy1tD0n_Cqfuv-gbU-NABZAm0n97WnGsCKvQSNOl8v5R5wb54WWw46O1851zSyF0ykwNbGpMSPkZabPRM6TGEzgz1CnTLPASeEFegggz/s1600-h/inner_sanctum.png)man in black enters the inner sanctum (note: authorized personnel only)[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhiOdXeJK0WmJAYp2zctZeg53iCMWK3DI_96Tr71bRekQ4pRW2A7zjVtYHeRyXHrsRB01PF18D7FrUxkHVpBrAFlI6KVyBr3tTO236ExK5zU0DIJqbojXqnLvIBqbmLuXhujTAO/s1600-h/bob_meeting.png)Bob sets the tone (note pipe)[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhi5uPfwdoQbSLuQHETDdUdKH2kfmtOTkKpQwKbQfGiInk2VVCNDARmw-JD3xKzXIJyhSk26UCHcfdQAWmL0TZqBZOsYcKBUNpACjhwimH0ii6fNvimSkIjNIDU59rx-Moy8mjg/s1600-h/bob_chooses.png)Bob helps choose which future is brightest[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjSQBfDOBxgPzaESTyhKFauAlq8Gh1uQ8K8RZ2_kopLxNrowD3DoN8oaegbUL9h3Ir4Ekyr6q-xOfMiI6Iqz8ihpkHpMdFIcbuM5LVQhOIbdpylDoEKgD144NCTZFvtdB8y6mXH/s1600-h/bob_pleased.png)unveiling the clay carBob (center, with pipe) is pleased",
