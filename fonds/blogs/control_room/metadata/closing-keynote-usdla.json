  "content": "The closing keynote [by Burck Smith](http://www.usdla.org/v/vspfiles/satellite_sites/2015conference/BurckSmithBiography.pdf) focused on mega-trends for the future.\n\nNon-accredited institutions are muscling in to the same teaching space occupied by accredited institutions.\n\nAccreditation has been a kind of monopoly allowing those on the inside to keep their tuitions high.\n\nWith the falling cost of course delivery thanks to distance education, profits have been fattening for the accredited, but at high cost to students.\n\nIn the next chapter, the competition from the players outside the accredited sphere are likely to make deeper inroads into diploma space, offering certificates instead.",
