  "content": "Except for a very few brave hearts in the US Congress, the lawmakers caved, conceding their irrelevance to TV screenwriting.\n\nThe Reality TV people know how to take scripts through production and onto the world stage, without the slow unworkable process of churning out gigantic laws no one reads.\n\nGigantic laws are OK for budgets maybe, such as the latest wish list (please buy our bonds!), but when it comes to fast action, we don't want to think that hard.\n\nThe question is whether the military coup is complete.\u00a0 Threats were issued, that more unauthorized actions might be necessary, to silence Congress once and for all.\n\nEarlier presidents had expressed an interest in closing Gitmo.\u00a0 The latest president, determined to appear strong, went along with the torture camp.\u00a0 He also gave his mercenaries almost twice what they asked for. In exchange:\u00a0 the right to dictate wars at will.\n\nOf course \"animal Assad\" was literally true, not insulting.\u00a0 Animals are cool, unless you're a yahoo (chuckle).\u00a0 The missiles would be \"smart\" (i.e. dumb).\u00a0 Indeed they were.\u00a0 They helped cover up the Syrian chemical weapons program, or lack thereof, by destroying evidence.\u00a0 Classic.\n\nWith Congress out of the picture (in terms of even rubber stamping attacks on nations), we've moved to a faster paced world.\u00a0 Lawless warlords and nuclear weapons don't mix, so we'll need to get rid of lawless warlords, given the nukes will take a longer time to get rid of.\u00a0 Stay tuned.",
