  "content": "My rant against gerontocracy (which flirts with idiocracy) turned out to be timely, as various events reminded people that the organizers of our little conflagration are angry oldsters with complexes. Russian and Ukrainian youth are in dreams deferred mode, whereas US youths aren\u2019t facing a draft at least. \u00a0There\u2019s empathy all around for the subjugated youth at the hands of tyrannical geriatrics.\n\nDuring militaristic times, advances in civil rights bog down, because the people freeze into military hierarchies, become top down. Bottom up reforms get stymied as the commanders get bossy and send grunts to the front. If you had wanted more egalitarian democracy and more privileges and rights for both minors and adults alike, then outward war was misbegotten.\n\nWe\u2019re looking at the civil right, the human freedom, to not be abused by ideologues who believe it\u2019s their job to hatch and execute plans for all the rest of us. We\u2019re the extras. If you\u2019re not of a mind to be stuffed in a nasty old tank and sent into some stupid old fashioned tank battle, I understand. You\u2019d rather not have your life ruined by morons, I get it.\n\nI\u2019m not typecasting all old people as misguided. A lot of them live according to obsolete thought patterns, true, but oldsters also have more hindsight, more experience, and in many cases more time to ponder and rethink. A good way to get out from under gerontocracy is to listen to oldsters telling how. Remember how MAD magazine used to leak the secrets of PR gurus (ad men, mad men of Madison Avenue), making allies among kids like me, just starting across the minefield of adulthood.",
