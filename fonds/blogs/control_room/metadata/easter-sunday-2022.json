  "content": "Greetings to the blogosphere.\u00a0 We used to call it that more, back when we used the word \"sphere\" about everything, a German language influence no doubt (half kidding:\u00a0 thinking Sloterdijk).\n\nI'm a working class hero, or lets say \"essential worker\" this Easter.\u00a0 I'll be working through Ramadan as well, but with adjusted hours (many in this cohort will be observing).\u00a0 My clock time schedule today is not too onerous.\u00a0 I do have visiting family, as this Easter coincides, almost, with Carol turning 93.\n\nBack to the theme of institutional wealth:\u00a0 there's a lot of momentum from wills past.\u00a0 Foundations and so on.\u00a0 In terms of targeted funding, that's where fund accounting comes in, the kind of bookkeeping that makes it easier for donors to trace and audit whether their earmarks were respected.\u00a0 If the check was sent for a groundwater pump, where's the pump?\u00a0 With their name on it (figuratively, in the bookkeeping).\n\nSoftware allows nit-picky micromanagement whereas human intelligence is about when to break some silly rule.\u00a0 Management is always reshaping the clay of organizational intelligence, a beast in its own right some say.\u00a0 Church politics is somewhat similar.\u00a0 Even when practiced by Methodists I would assume.\n\nI woke up to some new Graham Phillips footage from Mariupol, which I watched beginning to end and then forwarded onto Facebook.\u00a0 Sometimes we mark great tragedies against the wheeling calendar of whatever holy days. During class tonight, I'll be presenting some Naval Observatory program, recast in Python, designed to find Easter on any given year, within a range.",
