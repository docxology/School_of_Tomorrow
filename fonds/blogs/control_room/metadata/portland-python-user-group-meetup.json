CTO).\n\nThen we had lightning talks.\u00a0 The one about Jupyter Notebooks included some tips I'm planning to try. \n\nDr. D. (PhD) was able to join us, coming from his presentation at Terwilliger Plaza (a retirement campus) regarding Humanists and Humanism.\u00a0 He's president of the local chapter, and also a computer science guy, if not specifically into Python.\u00a0 He has his own research project, revolving around a language for mapping out and implementing parallel processing schemas.\u00a0 He drove me home.\n\nHow PPUG goes forward from here is unknown.\u00a0 Will we get to meet at New Relic again?\u00a0 Who will buy the pizza?\u00a0 The usual rule is whoever buys pizza is welcome to promote and present about their company, including in recruit mode.\u00a0 New Relic was operating well within the rules.\u00a0 We expressed our collective gratitude.",
