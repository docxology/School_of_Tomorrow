  "content": "Freshman year Princeton found me in the engineering library browsing standards, not really knowing why.\u00a0 I'd fallen to Earth and now had a world class open stack library within walking distance.\u00a0 Time to catch up on what's been going on.\u00a0 I believe it would have been in the course of that reading that I would have first stumbled upon Unicode, along with ISO this and ISO that.\u00a0 No W3 yet, back then.\n\nIn some ways social commentary by the pundits is uninteresting because it hasn't swallowed enough of the facts.\u00a0 We have social engineers now ([e.g. Facebook](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WittrsEX/message/4753)), much as you folks feared we would, and we actually do have a human languages friendly way of preserving diversity.\n\nSome conservatives just assumed the engineering caste was so partial to Anglos that we would just get on with some conquest.\u00a0 That's not how it turned out however.\u00a0 Pirates took in engineering and now so many engineers talk like pirates, use profanity, or at least feel safe in doing so when they wish.\u00a0 Sailors strut on land, full citizens, despite the landlubbers' having their traditional puppet authorities (Kings and Queens and such).\u00a0 A more believable form of democracy seems close at hand some days.\n\nI was just realizing I'd been tacitly waiting for universities to get wise and field any number of anthropologists, as that's what management needs (more insights), whether it knows it or not.\u00a0 Books [like Bucciarelli's](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/isepp-lecture-end-of-season.html) were pioneering (How the Hippies Saved Physics also).\u00a0 But the wave didn't come, and I realized what that means:\u00a0 it's up to us to think [more like anthropologists](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/04/roller-coaster-at-reed.html) and not wait for the self-professed to get wise.\n\nLearn from the anthropologists what you'll need and [apply the skills](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/06/sketchy-ethnography.html) as they develop.\u00a0 Don't worry about your \"credentials\" to think in those terms.\u00a0 You don't have to pay licensing fees for the thoughts you have, much as we've become amputees in other respects, thanks to \"the law\" and its rewarding of selfishness past the point of pathology.\u00a0 The wages of sin.\u00a0 The sorrows of empire.\u00a0 Illiberal policies, when it comes to knowledge sharing, leads to a Tower of Babel syndrome pretty quickly.\u00a0 Almost no one has enough puzzle pieces, even Gollum.\n\nConference badges are a space where it all comes together, as well as patient-facing medical monitor screens.\u00a0 If they can't print or display the Chinese or Thai characters that make up your name in its native context, then to what extent have they bothered to master our shared technology?\u00a0 How lazy, in a more negative sense, are they being?\u00a0\u00a0 For sure the competition will eschew advertising such incapacities.\u00a0 The LCDs in the hotel room (or hospital room) will be in your favorite language (or choose the one you're learning).\u00a0 Use the remote to change the view.\n\nIt's OK to judge at this point, to stop making allowances for yet another generation of journalist that can't write about Unicode intelligibly.\u00a0 You needn't be a \"technical writer\" to tackle that subject.\u00a0 The schools have had the time in principle, it sort of doesn't matter whether they lunged at the opportunity.\u00a0 It's a computation:\u00a0 oh, you could have and didn't, lots of time lost, so now we stop waiting.\u00a0 We refine our level of expectation: \"Ah so, it was too hard for them.\"\n\nWhat some anthropologists might study is the geek use of the term \"laziness\".\u00a0 The usage pattern goes with the grain of many a Chinese philosophy.\u00a0 The management caste is well aware of how easy it is to fall into a hero mode that's unsustainable and self-overwhelming.\u00a0 You start accelerating, go into \"fixit mode\" whereas a big picture generalist will allow that some individuals need to hang back and keep to some level of overview, much as some soap opera or melodrama becomes interesting.\u00a0 Quakers have their overseers ([rotating positions](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/12/management-by-rotation.html)) for this purpose, not just their clerk.\n\nIn software, you have the tools to automate drudgery and push the work onto machines.\u00a0 It's an overwhelming amount of work happening at superhuman speeds, so even a hint of it coming the other way, starting to make you the big \"doer\" has the whiff of incipient tragedy.\u00a0 The geek knows that and insists on writing a script to do the work.\u00a0 \"If I end up doing all these things manually, my day will rapidly become hellish\" is the familiar diagnosis.\u00a0 Treatment is indicated.\u00a0 The prognosis is good if the geek is given the liberty to pursue \"laziness\" as an end in itself.\u00a0 Enter the Church of the Subgenius and Bob's gift of \"slack\".\n\nThe role of profanity is starkly clear in Titanic, the movie.\u00a0 I'm not sure this aspect of the film was accurately captured in the various dubbings, as some movie-going ethnicities may not accept cussing in public.\u00a0 The Titanic itself has upper and lower deck subcultures.\u00a0 When the ship starts to sink, the lower deck people have no priority for life boats.\u00a0 In the near future of this world, [a more globalized engineering caste](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WittrsEX/message/4819) is controlling the search vessel and indulging in lower deck like banter.\u00a0 One interpretation is the future was less mindful of class.\u00a0 In a related meme, the King and Queen are invited to eat \"hot dogs\" with Bill Murray, playing FDR.\u00a0 The findings of science have been accepted. \n\nThe idea that \"the blood itself\" contained distinguishing chemistry had mostly vanished from medical science.\u00a0 We were all software running hardware running software.\u00a0 The concept of \"race\" was following \"class\" into intellectual morbidity.\u00a0 That doesn't mean we had stopped believing in selective breeding or genetic material.\u00a0 Distinguishing chemistry exists, like finger prints.\u00a0 Distinguishing memes also make their circuits.\u00a0 Peers continue to recognize one another by gesture and secret handshake.\u00a0 The many protocols would only continue to proliferate.\u00a0 The idea of \"no class\" and \"no race\" is in becoming so very very many, Venn diagrams gone wild.\u00a0 Everyone is different, that's for sure (even twins).",
