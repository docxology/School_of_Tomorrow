  "content": "Given I work in the code school industry, videos like this get my attention.  Would be bootcampers should take a look at the different \"stacks\" the schools offer.  Not every path to becoming a full stack web developer is the same.  Do you want JavaScript top to bottom?  Check the MEAN stack.  Were you hoping for Python?  We have those stacks too.\n\nYour code school may well be associated with some \"accelerator program\", that's par for the course. Code schools often affiliate with startup incubators. \u00a0That makes sense. \u00a0Finding students of the latest tools is not always easy. \u00a0That's where code schools come in, especially those willing to stay nimble and encourage experimentation with the newer tools.\n\nExperimenting with newer tools does not require abandoning tried and trusted curricula. \u00a0The devil is in the details. \u00a0Blending old and new requires alchemy. \u00a0Attracting creative students helps further the process along, as mentors tend to answer to their students most of all.",
