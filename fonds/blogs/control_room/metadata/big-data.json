  "content": "I'm all for swapping stories about which family had what, [whether slaves were involved](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/10/revisiting-slavery.html), midnight brewing, 'til the cows come home, on into the wee hours. \u00a0Having big data crunched together and visualized helps historians structure a layer, a layout, in the multi-layered timeline we're always building. \u00a0There's way too much to ever capture so we need to be smart about what we keep and just can't. \u00a0Yes, I'm guilty of speaking quite generally.\n\nI guess I'm saying I'm not uncomfortable with family histories being out there. \u00a0I'm reading Royal Babylon at the moment (downloaded to Kindle), on advice from a friend, and I'm sure that's coloring my journaling. \u00a0I like demented cartoons too, what can I say.\n\nRegarding Quakers for example, and the arguments around slavery leading up to and through the US's Civil War [tm] -- a terrible battle of wills, and fought against a Biblical backdrop, in terms of painting a long term destiny for one's self (those tended to be their images -- nothing radioactive yet) -- I'm fine with revisiting those. \u00a0Keep going over the texts, playing the old records, yes. \u00a0But they won't sound the same, as your own tastes continue changing.\n\nThe intersection of Friends and Native Americans post the Civil War is on my plate as a focus and I'm not even a paid historian or anything. \u00a0I just find myself wading in these waters and need to know more of the landscape. \u00a0It's not that I came to the planet pre-loaded with encyclopedic knowledge.\n\nGetting a different version of history than the one you're getting. \u00a0That's always useful. \u00a0Patronizing people say it's not good for you, drives you crazy, too confusing. \u00a0I say better to get used to that: multiple tellings. \u00a0It's neither a crime nor a problem to be solved.\n\nI said at my workshop I don't think we do nearly enough with timelines on the Internet. \u00a0We could be doing a lot more towards integrating chronologies. \u00a0Then you realize what you're up against: \u00a0people aren't necessarily ready for such and such to be known. \u00a0 Crunching data too hard is like hiring too many Colombo's, detectives actually good at their jobs. \u00a0It's not like you're even looking for trouble, it just comes when you squeeze the sponge.\n\nNevertheless, historians have a job, which is to tell us a story that really helps us make sense of what happened in a way that serves going forward. \u00a0That sounds like a tall order, but I'm just trying to establish a rank. \n\nGreat storytelling reminds you of the generalized pattern integrities -- to lapse into Bucky-sounding. Historians, like investigative journalists, need to dig, and not believe the first version of events somebody feeds them. \u00a0Keep looking, keep digging. \u00a0Be skeptical. \u00a0I'm OK with that ethic. \u00a0I appreciate detectives and crime solving, or even just plot discovering (stories need not be of criminals to be interesting).",
