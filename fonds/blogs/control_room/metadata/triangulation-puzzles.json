I've watched [lots of those](https://youtu.be/zDZFcDGpL4U).\u00a0 Too many talking heads, teacher's back turned, writing... Not how we want it on TV.\n\nI'd also like [more density](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/boosting-bandwidth.html), with cutaways to talk about hardware, the history of storage ([per Von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectron_tube))... a much wider selection of topics, inter-connected.\n\nHow 'bout it? Better STEM TV anyone?\n\nLets build up the library, the videogrammatron, of short clips anyone might use.\u00a0 High production values are maybe self defeating if locked entirely behind some IMAX screen.\u00a0 Lets share the IP.\n\nPlus I'm talking about quirky art in addition, affordable and within range of solo artists.\n\nThe mix would be reminiscent of Sesame Street in some collections.",
