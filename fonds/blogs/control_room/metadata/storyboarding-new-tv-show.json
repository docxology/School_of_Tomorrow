Any help with generative algorithms could be a big hit.  I'm\n likewise seeking to blend Burning Man type \"tribal centers\" \n(experimental prototypes) into networked Country Faire vistas, suitable \nfor year around camping in some cases.  Lots of food trucks / carts / \npods ala Portland, mix of tents big and small (fractal), also domes big \nand small (a kind of tent, or yurt).Creating these vistas on computer, for fly through, gives the script more traction with would-be producers.\n\nI've been talking with John Driscoll\n an architecture student about the building and city generation \nalgorithms used for games and potentially reality planning.\u00a0\n\nI'm thinking\n Refugee Science will prove an imaginative theme park motif actually \nadds to camp prosperity, cuts down on crime. This might be in the \nvicinity of some truck stop such that supplies and transportation are in\n golf cart distance (light rail?), but the village itself is mostly \ngeared for pedestrians, Disneyland style.",
