We went from an empty room with a utility sink to a functional office in just three or four days.She's recycling old props: the desk from an area center garage; the rug (on loan); the small refrigerator; the kneeling chair. The metal frame futon and computer are new: I assembled both, while Derek helped with the heavy glass and frame.The computer, TurningWheel, is a Hewlett-Packard Pentium 4, has a gig of DDR and a 19\" flat screen monitor. I drove out to Fry's for it, having seen the Mother's Day ad in the paper.The building has wireless, other amenities.  Lots of artists and small businesses have set up shop here.",
