His English is pure Floridian (that's his homeland).\u00a0 He's from Orlando, to pin it down.\u00a0 His field, prior to joining the Landmark faculty, was fiber optics and related technologies, so he's a bit of a geek, he was quick to confess.\n\nI hope I didn't offend anyone (well OK, a few) in saying \"adorable\" just now, about those completing their Forum and sharing things they'd realized from the Friday through Sunday experience.\u00a0 Tuesday, included in the program as a course completing experience, is also an opportunity to bring friends and family, fellow co-workers, whomever, to this guests-welcome event.\n\nThe Landmark enterprise has been successful in remaining secular yet friendly to religions.\u00a0 One video we saw sampled from Clergy, Scientists, Artists, and other walks of life.\u00a0 The talking heads delivered strongly positive testimony obviously, not that Naveed avoided the topic of skepticism in any way.\u00a0 Suspicion is natural and part of human nature for a reason.\n\nClearly the Tuesday event is designed to mitigate any psychological obstacles to signing up, the tuition cost itself obviously a consideration.\u00a0 That sacrifice fuels the event in that practically no one intends to be ripped off after signing up to commit to something about improving the quality of one's own life for a pretty penny.\u00a0 The logic is tight and well known in the education community:\u00a0 people are more open to accepting rewards they sense they've earned, through hard work and risk taking.\n\nHaving those just completing said course offer personal testimonials, and having invited guests join them, is a working recipe, not unlike how some restaurants build their business.\u00a0 Since the early days, [est](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/12/some-storytelling.html) was accused of using [\"hard sell\" tactics](http://www.motherjones.com/media/2009/07/landmark-42-hours-500-65-breakdowns).\u00a0 Advertising in a billboard or TV sense is not among those tactics however.\u00a0 Word of mouth is the way to go.\u00a0 Slick advertising would actually undermine the practice grads get in applying their own spin, not that the videos they showed us don't constitute PR.\u00a0 I went away with a colorful brochure.\n\nI don't want to say that Landmark has \"cornered the market\" on what it does, just that it does what it does quite well, which had been my experience with Centers Network in an earlier chapter.\u00a0 I served as logistics supervisor and so on, as recounted elsewhere in more detail -- this was back in New York City, and in New Jersey before that, rewinding the tape to Princeton days and Walter Kaufmann etc. then fast forwarding, showing me getting into the Bucky stuff pretty quickly.\u00a0 I was then living in Jersey City, teaching high school, and tracking Werner Erhard's career.\n\nRather than focus on competitive aspects of the human potential programs, both religious and secular, and including AA, I prefer to see Landmark as somewhat in [the Open Source ballpark](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/revisiting-landmark.html), as community supported.\u00a0 Sure, much is confidential, in terms of individuals' records, but 2.2 million people is not negligible and the whole point is to take the methodology back to work.\u00a0 Oaths of secrecy are not a big part of it, just don't blab if you see Britney (or whomever) in your room.\n\nAt events like this, where people wore name tags prominently identifying their Landmark affiliation, it'd be silly to say total anonymity was a goal.\u00a0 On the contrary, testimonials are worth a lot more when personally signed, i.e. when traceable to real people.\n\nSaying the Landmark Forum is \"secret\" is therefore way too melodramatic.\u00a0 Listening with an ear for the possibilities a communication and/or relationship presents is worth more as a willingness and a skill, than as good avuncular advice, and intensive training goes beyond mere advising in these dense format sessions, or call them \"boot camp\" experiences.\u00a0 \"You had to be there\" is a cliche for a reason.\n\nThe software industry likewise intensifies and concentrates in some places.\u00a0 The Landmark Forum has elements in common with the \"sprint\" in software development circles, especially when conducted as in-person events.\u00a0 Participants are there to add value, and to learn, not as passive spectators but as active contributors, even though in software that may mean little more than wiggling one's fingers over a keyboard.\n\nThe Panda Express company, among others, is happy to endorse the quality of the Landmark experience.\u00a0 Quite a few companies are not especially shy about advertising their connection, with some offering tuition as an employee benefit.\n\nAgain, the [Open Source culture](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/07/oscon-xv.html) is similar in having reached a truce or understanding in a kind of charitable activity that earns good will, yet advantages the participants in more specific and technological ways.\u00a0 \"Lets agree on these public utilities and add value within\" -- that attitude becomes a source of a network's cohesion as a shared resource.\n\nIf we agree on [co-creating the playing field](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2015-July/011289.html), then we can have our secrets within it.\u00a0 We agree on the rules of poker but then -- and so then -- don't need to show all our cards (according to the rules of poker, MIT license or whatever).\n\nAlthough I did not wear my anthropology hat, not literally (I have a black Stetson we might call my Anthropology hat -- [reminds me to stay ethnic](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/08/all-math-is-ethnomath.html)), part of my motivation in being there was to update myself on this side of my culture.\u00a0 What was the lineage like these days coming up on a half century?\n\nOf course to know the answers in more detail I'd have to review the course.\u00a0 That's a real possibility. I'm examining my options as to where in the world would be a good place.\u00a0 There's one in Seattle where they're translating into Farsi.\u00a0 That looked pretty interesting.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/19886077493/in/dateposted-public/)",
