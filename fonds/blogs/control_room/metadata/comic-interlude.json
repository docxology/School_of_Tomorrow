[Hi Cameron](http://portlandcitycenter.katu.com/news/weird/449951-arrest-made-after-worlds-smallest-park-occupied).\n\nIt'll be a failure of capitalism this Xmas if we don't already have the action figure kits, manger scene scale (like toy army guys), with little anarchists with tents, little riot cops with vans.\n\nJunior can line up the cops around the camp while the anarchists amass.\u00a0 Depending on political leanings, the narrative may go differently.\n\nSome will put the baby Jesus right inside a tent ([Food Not Bombs tent?](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/virtual-opdx.html)), complete with straw, cute animals, and a few defectors from the 1% ([the three Magi](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/christmas-folk-lore.html)).\n\nOthers will have their policemen smash those dirty commies with gusto, MacArthur style (President Hoover as King Herod?), while mom & dad beam proudly.\n\nKoski has been replying to Zubek on Youtube, sharing the war on Poly, where grown children are still grumbly-grumpy about Bucky getting a molecule named after himself 'n stuff, when he really didn't invent anything new.\n\nHow can you put a refrigerator in a dome shaped home anyway?\n\nGimme a break right?\n\nI bet they talk like this at Harvard all the time (snicker, superior Princeton sniff).\n\nMe to David (typo fixed):\n\nThis stuff about the fridge:\n\nYou should remind folks that many of the architects working with\nFuller came up with more conventional rectilinear \"stage prop\"\ninteriors, that would protect privacy, but not have to be weatherized,\nas the surrounding dome was doing that. \u00a0More efficient, by simple\nback of the napkin computations. \u00a0More green. \u00a0More sustainable.\n\nIn fact, Fuller's designs were quite smart and his cultist followers,\ne.g Kirby Urner, think the ambient culture just didn't have the IQ.\n\"It's Planet of the Apes around here\" is his usual off-the-kuffka\nremark ([cuffka.com](http://cuffka.com/)).\n\nThe usual picture, duh:\n[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue22/buckminsterfuller.htm](http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue22/buckminsterfuller.htm)\n\n[http://www.mydigitallife.co.za/index.php?option=com_myblog&task=tag&category=buckyball&Itemid=29](http://www.mydigitallife.co.za/index.php?option=com_myblog&task=tag&category=buckyball&Itemid=29)\n(duh rectilinear as you like inside -- could be a city)\n\nAll this crap about the refrigerator is just teasing at recess, not\nserious in any way. \u00a0\"Hey, your zipper's down!\".\n\nI'm something of a misanthropist when it comes to mean little children\nthat grew up to become mean little adults.\n\u00a0I've been [yukking it up](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Wittrs/message/7120) on the Wittgenstein list too.",
