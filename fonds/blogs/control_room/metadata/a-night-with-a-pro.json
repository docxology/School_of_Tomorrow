  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/albums/72157631695870388)\n\nWe enjoyed an excellent presentation at Multnomah Meeting this evening, by a pro photographer, Skip Schiel, who works with Quakers and the AFSC.\u00a0 He's up on some of the latest non-violent campaigns to restore a modicum of sanity into the Hellish Land (aka Holy Land, aka Israel-Palestine-Gaza).\n\nInterestingly, these latest campaigns focus on the Grunch (Caterpillar, HP... [Motorola](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/01/activism-portlandia-style.html)) and less on aging institutions like the State Department or United Nations.\u00a0 I could hear Bucky echoing in my ears:\u00a0 \"the once proud nations\".\u00a0 Yes, soldiers still put themselves in harm's way, but as Smedley \"Fighting Quaker\" Butler put it:\u00a0 war is a racket.\n\nLots of maps, good profiles, updated information.\u00a0 I felt like I was [back in Samsara](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/09/samsara-movie-review.html) in some ways, enjoying the beautiful landscapes, some impressive engineering.\u00a0 That train looks cool.\u00a0 It felt good to update the brain bank with more recent images.\u00a0 I hadn't visited [in Ramallah](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/lailas-birthday-movie-review.html) since the 1970s.\n\nInterestingly, Jeanne at [our lunch today](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/10/sanity-check.html) asked directly if I were Swiss.\u00a0 She married a Swiss guy and so knows the lore of the place, understood about Uri.\u00a0 I don't encounter people familiar with [that namespace](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/whats-urner.html) all that often.\n\nI asked Skip later if he knew about Albert Einstein's views ([thinking of OMSI](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/07/einstein-omsi.html), but also this bio I have).\u00a0 My understanding is he thought nationalism was for the birds but didn't think those birds would be relinquishing control any time soon, certainly not in his lifetime.\u00a0 He turned down a chance to role play a president.\n\nThe bird-brained reflexes associated with knee-jerk nationalism go back to knee-jerks of even deeper reptilian origin.\u00a0 Religion ties in through the limbic system (or one of those) and voila:\u00a0 crazy humanity. Self-organizing?\u00a0 We wish.\n\nI'm sympathetic to Rabbi Lerner's idea of a \"[no state solution](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/01/scholar-talks.html)\".\u00a0 Once two cars have a head on collision, or two trains, you don't always try to sort them out too carefully.\u00a0 There was a train wreck of sorts, and whatever others want to say about it, I think nationalism itself became a self parody in this smash up, its own casualty.\u00a0 \n\n\"Nations\" were mostly in the belief systems of \"little people\" anyway, right up there with Santa Claus in the Tooth Fairy.\u00a0 The European royals saw more in terms of marriages (family) and warring ideologies (Catholic vs. Protestant etc.)\u00a0 Do a little homework, and the nations fade in with the other psychological complexes, more programming, the operating system.\u00a0 It keeps morphing.\u00a0 The Chinese parade dragon, twisty turny, is its sometime avatar.\n\nNo, I'm not expecting the pomp and circumstance of nations to disappear, not even over the long haul.\u00a0 Could be we'll see [many more of them](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/01/cyber-nations.html), including under the oceans.\u00a0 We still have shades of the Roman Empire to this day, so why should we expect anything so neat and obvious as a Fuller Projection, intelligently nationless, except in the occasional meeting, board or classroom.\u00a0 History isn't like that.\n\nPeople live in the past (the after image).\u00a0 We don't all get the news at the same time, although global telecommunications is time crunching us more than usual, getting us in some \"present\".\n\nIn 2045 or sooner, someone with the requisite academic \"weightiness\" may argue the USA had effectively left the world stage by the 1980s, some \"withering of the states\" phenomenon (all of them) amidst a new world order (predicted by presidents, not just Lenin or Marx, the Promised Land of the Illuminati?).\n\nIt'd be one more Youtube, perhaps cogently argued.\u00a0 As science fiction, it makes sense today.\n\nTrillions of dollars of annual deficits?\u00a0 A desk-bound military helpless to not buy [tanks](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7886625) it doesn't need?\u00a0 Where is there a \"USA\" in this picture except in cartoon form?\u00a0\u00a0 Does anyone really believe all this crappola?\u00a0\u00a0 You can fool some of the people all of the time eh?\n\nWe've seen a lot of movies and know how to suspend disbelief.\u00a0\u00a0 Nations live on in our suspended disbelief.\n\nTheir withering didn't stop us from having some interesting theater though.\n\nWe've inherited from history (duh).\u00a0 To some degree, we're puppets, machine-dolls -- that's what karma is all about, and Samsara ([the movie](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/09/samsara-movie-review.html)).\n\nWhether we believe in these nations or not, we're compelled to go through the motions, acting them out somewhat unconvincingly.\u00a0 [As NPR put it](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/10/sanity-check.html), Romney is \"plausible\" as president and so of course is Obama.\u00a0 That's talent we can work with, as screen writers, as we dream our lives away (you've gotta believe in something, right?).\n\nI also asked Skip if AFSC had asked him to photograph the US-Mexico wall as well, a somewhat similar project in many ways.\u00a0 It hadn't (yet), though others have done so. \n\nThe swallowing of North American real estate by a Federation of States (like in Switzerland) is another partially overlapping historical narrative, with many of the same plot elements (poor treatment of the natives, zealotry, bigotry, land grabbing and greed).\n\nWave upon wave of \"true believers\" made America what it is today.\u00a0 Ozymandius was here.\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5815210183/)",
