  "content": "You'd think [Global U](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html) doctoral candidates would be fanning out across the land to chronicle [the early history](http://grunch.net/synergetics/domes/domehist.html) of geodesic dome building, as this was the architectural breakthrough for which the 1900s will be remembered in large degree.\n\nA lot of the early pioneers are still alive and willing to talk.  \n\nDick Lehr was [only just caught on tape](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/10/necessary-ruin-movie-review.html) before he died.  Other [key players](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/06/fuller-schoolers.html), such as with Synergetics Inc., TC Howard [chief among them](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/geodesichelp/ctWyVQMH4ao/O9hWh5s4E2cJ), may not have been taped yet, I don't know.  \n\nDavid Koski and I have been looking into it.  Duncan Stuart is another one.  [Don Richter](http://grunch.net/snelson/snelpix1.html) of course. Jim Fitzgibbon, Jonathan Smith, Jeremy Martin... Thanks to John Braley for [some of this scholarship](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/26751). Edward Popko has been providing some puzzle pieces as well.\n\nHowever, in so many ways [the Global U](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/03/campus-household.html) is broken and we get to live with the symptoms of that. \n\nGetting [a working curriculum](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/workaday-world.html) is a top priority and philanthropy will have a lot to do with revivifying various moribund circuits, many of them \"between the ears\" in popular consciousness.  \n\nOr call it \"connecting the dots\".",
