I had my 4D stills.\u00a0 Ray traced.\u00a0 I say 4D as [a kind of branding](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/07/another-introduction-to-tetravolumes.html), not referring to Time.\u00a0 Ben had a new Pi too, same make and model, and he and another guy helped me catch up on Minecraft a little, at least in create mode.\u00a0 Peter Farrell is still ahead of me there.\n\nThese 4D shapes are ordinary convex polys, generated using [the geodesic program](http://www.antiprism.com/programs/geodesic.html) in Antiprism, a suite of tools by Adrian Rossiter.\n\nI've been working on getting his C++ to compile on the ARM chip in a small [Raspberry Pi 3](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/08/pov-ray-on-pi.html), Model B. The thing boots off its GPU which doubles as a sort of BIOS.\u00a0 The Pi3D module, imported within Python, seems to be getting full value from said Graphics Processing Unit.\u00a0 Farrell's [Hacking Math Class](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/06/thirsters-201663.html), uses Pi3D quite a bit, also the turtle module.\u00a0 Wifi is also built in.\n\nI also compiled Povray, a program I used in Windows a lot, way back in the days of CompuServ.\n\nNow that this tool chain is working, I can do something like this...\n\ngeodesic -c 1 -f 6 > output.off\noff2pov render_me.pov output.off\npovray -Irender_me.pov\n\nThat's roughly how it goes, minus some switches. I get a PNG file out the end, suitable for tweeting.\u00a0 Some of the STEM teachers already have a stack of Pis and are looking for worthy projects.\u00a0 I've been [filing my reports](https://flic.kr/p/KCeeC8).\n\nI introduced myself quickly as \"a lobbyist\" as we went around the circle, mentioning my work with the teachers, especially high school math teachers.\n\nI had Peter Farrell's book in my briefcase, strapped to the bicycle.\u00a0 It sits next to my Pi Station in the CodeCastle as well (I've also used CodeCastle with reference to a certain neighborhood \"[ghost church](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/ghost-church.html)\", but that's still speculative fiction at this point).\n\nSomeone brand new to Portland, just moved here, expressed his intent to dive into Natural Language Processing more. We talked about Elisa, Racter (another \"convo-bot\"), the Tom Sawyer corpus, and setting up a measuring protocol of some kind.\u00a0 The algorithm could measure negativity in some way, for example.\n\nThis wish for a protocol is characteristic of Nat's project as well, relating to motion and profiling autistic features. [Nat](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/adventures-in-toontown.html) and I have followed up a bit since our meeting, regarding the recently proved Kepler Conjecture, seeing as how the proof bridges mathematics and computer science, a theme in [my lobbying for Measure 97](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/07/back-in-lobbyland.html).\n\n(Art + Code + High) * School =\u00a0\nArt School + Code School + High School\n\nHere's a way [for teachers](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/gateway-to-asia.html) to generate more synergy amongst themselves, from which their students might benefit.\n\nI'm back in the world of bicycle tubes and tires, not a bad world to be in.\u00a0 It got me there just fine, even with the slow leak.\u00a0 Coming back, I needed the walk anyway.\n\nRegarding Antiprism, I don't currently use antiview, the included highly capable viewer, \nbecause the flavor of OpenGL used on the Pi was not Antiprism's target \nOpenGL or development platform.\u00a0 Antiview compiles, just isn't \ndisplaying content correctly. That's OK.\u00a0 Having povray working gets me where I want to go.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/29251687341/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nantiprism + povray on a Pi 3\n\nGot the flat tire mentioned in my code school blog fixed.
