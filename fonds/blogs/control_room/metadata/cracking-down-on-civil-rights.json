  "content": "Freedom of assembly, for the purpose of making views public, by carrying signs, making speeches and so on, is protected by precedent, by the Bill of Rights (US) and so on.\u00a0 However, the political climate in North America is such that xenophobes get everyone nodding in agreement that a political event is somehow \"fake\" or \"inauthentic\" if organized in collaboration with groups not based inside North America.\n\nFor example, we Quakers have a close-knit set of relationships connecting the Federated States meetings with those in the United Kingdom.\u00a0 We might get support from English Friends to divest of our slaves for example.\u00a0 This happened before the Civil War.\u00a0\n\nMany Quakers felt uncomfortable in areas where slavery was still legal in the eyes of the Supreme Court.\u00a0 They were coached not to tell neighbors what to do, but the neighbors couldn't help but feel some \"holier than thou\" attitude emanating from Friends in their midst.\n\nBy today's standards, if English Friends wanted to help organize an anti-slavery rally in Boston, and set up a Facebook account to help bring that about, the [heavy hand](https://youtu.be/ih4auGvzw4A) of a censor might come along and report the transgression to authorities, and to the media.\u00a0 [Listeners and viewers](https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=634349871:634349874) would learn to vilify anyone colluding on a global basis, rather than on a more narrowly constrained geographic basis.\u00a0\n\nSomehow it was to be made illegal for Ukrainians to fund protests in DC regarding their treatment, despite large numbers of Ukrainians enjoying Federation citizenship.\n\nNone of this made any sense, as the USG itself was highly leveraged and in debt, needing to collaborate and collude daily just to stay afloat.\u00a0 Trying to keep its citizens from using social media to organize public protests, while meanwhile engaging in international intrigue itself, was too much of a double standard for brave Americans to take seriously.\u00a0\n\nIf Facebook wasn't going to champion our rights, we had other options.\n\nWe also knew it was our business to protect our right to collude.\u00a0 The dimwits in DC had picked the wrong friends and enemies too many times to exert much leadership in that regard.\u00a0 Telling Americans what to do and whom to trade with, was no longer the business of the bankrupt bosses with their obsolete forms of organized gangsterism.",
