I'm [not sure](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/world-game-museum.html) that's a priority right now.The article is bold in daring to use the word \"[tetrahedron](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-wars-continued.html)\", generally considered too high brow a word for journalistic accounts, even in the Herald Tribune.  Maybe we're actually [getting somewhere](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/freezing-rain.html) in the numeracy department?The analysis concludes that Fuller's contributions are likely to find a more appreciative and receptive crew in the 21st century, now that we're starting to catch up with the guy:At a time when design and artistic practice is increasingly collaborative, open-ended and fluid, Fuller looks a lot less nutty, and more purposeful. So do his emphasis on concept, rather than the finished product, and his capacity to embrace failure as a learning experience and a step toward success. \"You only succeed when you stop failing\" was a favorite motto. \"It is amazing that Bucky gets his day in the sun at the Whitney,\" said Cameron Sinclair. \"Part-genius, part-altruistic-visionary - what's not to admire?\"My thanks to [Bob McGown](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/recruiting-for-xrls.html) for the bucket below, something he scrounged for its \"allusionary value\".
