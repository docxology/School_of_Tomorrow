  "content": "In saying that nuke weapons are a tool of the few to enslave the many, I am not suggesting that many if any of \"the few\" are still alive.\n\nThe ecosystem of nuclear weapons, armed, targeted, set to go off, is the ticking time bomb bequeathed to us by [psychotic ancestors](http://en.allexperts.com/q/Physics-1358/2011/8/van-allen-belts.htm), clinically just through the Depression and newly high off the exhilaration of physics breakthroughs.\n\nHuman subject experiments continued both in and out of the internment, detention, and concentration camps, as well as on Pacific islands.\u00a0 Children inherit.\u00a0 Radio-toxins last a long time.\n\nBuilding public consciousness around radiation dangers is a slow process as it's best grounded in comprehension rather than blind fear.\u00a0 I'm not sure where Common Core is going with those physics standards, but we're hearing there's a distressing lack of CERN type stuff, i.e. the dance of particles.\n\nThis would correspond to the low Polyhedron Quotient (PQ) in the prototype Standard Maths.\n\nNeither standard (math or physics) takes many impressive steps in the direction of STEM integration.\u00a0 Rather, we're seeing more of the usual.\n\nContinuing to link the topic of radio-isotopes to both diet and medicine, the ecosystem, is vital.\n\nTracing the fallout from Fukushima is an everyday STEM exercise.\u00a0 We tie the dinner table to the ecosystem to the particles involved, right down to the quarks.\u00a0 We do this early. We do this often.\u00a0 No \"standards\" will get in our way.",
