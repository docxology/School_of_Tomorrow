  "content": "I was yakking with Steve at Horse Brass about how Quakers (Friends) have traditionally gotten along with military personnel.   The rank and file wanted to draft [George Fox](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/why-foxpro.html) as a commanding officer of some kind, or at least that's the rumor (scholars welcome to chime in -- on Facebook maybe?).  Annis Bleeke ([FWCC General Secretary, Ret.](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/london-knowledge-lab.html)) confirmed the elements of this story during social hour just today (I was showing off my new bike helmet, looks kind of German or Darth Vadery). In my own case, this heritage has translated into [wardrobe concerns](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/methodist-morning.html).  I've been eyeing abandoned US military bases and military surplus stores, as campus and prop inventory respectively, when writing my \"girl scout math\" curriculum (some boyz allowed), a kind of interactive theater.   We just visited Portland's top military surplus store yesterday, to stock up.  One of our household is heading out of the country (no, not for Pycon / Cuba).  She's in Houston right now. Steve suggested \"extra-military\" rather than \"[para-military](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/12/action-figure.html)\" would be more the label I'd wish for -- less controversial. I'm easy with either, as a Friend. Brand names such as Fox and Coyote have already been deployed.",
