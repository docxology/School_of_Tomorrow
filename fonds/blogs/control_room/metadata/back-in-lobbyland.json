Lets expand that, if we do, to public school teachers.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [July 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/750836549978206208)\n\nNeeded:  a nonprofit that bridges Silicon Forest / ONAMI w/ school teachers.  Would that be [#TAO](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TAO?src=hash) then?
