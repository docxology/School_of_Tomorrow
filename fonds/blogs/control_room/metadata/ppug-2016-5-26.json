Some of the same people go to both (hi Ben).\n\nHere we gather for presentations and sometimes pizza.\u00a0 Tonight Cloudbolt Software is getting to sponsor.\u00a0 The pizza is not here yet.\n\nTrevor does a better job of archiving the Bucky stuff in the meticulous fashion researchers require.\u00a0 [The Linus and Ava Helen Pauling collection](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/10/holding-two-nobel-prizes.html) at Oregon State, with the [Douglas Strain](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/12/tale-of-two-parties.html) Reading Room, showed me what a state of the art archives is all about.\n\nTrevor is uber diligent even in the absence of much funding, which is characteristic of those who bring order to Fuller's work.\u00a0 Not being paid is part of what makes it work, hard work.\n\nI'll plan to get him these materials uncovered above.\u00a0 The paper by Dr. Bob Gray shows how the characteristic arrangement of continents that go into making up the Fuller Projection is really what makes it stand out.\n\nUsing the Snyder or Genomic Projection algorithms, as distinct from Fuller's, results in mathematically measurable differences, but to the naked eye, the distortion is about the same i.e. minimal (compared to a Mercator, which takes the flat Earth perspective to an extreme).\n\nDr. Ernest Bonat, Senior Software Engineer, will address us tonight, on the topic of Implementing MVC Arcitecture in Python for Data Analysis.\u00a0 He works full time at Intel, but does data analysis consulting on the side.\n\nHe's here to tell us about his stack, 64-bit Windows based (Core i7, 16 GM RAM).\u00a0 Getting all the software in one place is his goal:\u00a0 [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) is his solution.\u00a0 He's Cuban, not Italian -- he wanted us to know.\u00a0 [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/) / [PyDev plugin](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/pydev-python-ide-eclipse) / [EGit plugin](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/) (free) is a good one.\u00a0 Microsoft is providing quite a lot for free these days, community edition everything, Python tools for Visual Studio, SQL Server etc.\n\nI've used Eclipse a lot, our defacto IDE at O'Reilly School, but since getting Anaconda I've been practicing with Spyder a lot.\u00a0 [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is an old standby as well, and popular with this audience (we did a show of hands).\u00a0 I'm glad he's showcasing Eclipse.\n\nPycon is next week, May 28 through June 5th.\u00a0 This particular Pycon, organized directly by the Python Software Foundation, is the largest annual gathering for the community using and developing the open source Python programming language.\u00a0 Steve Holden got the ball rolling on Pycons.\u00a0 EuroPython was first.\n\nSteve is not coming to Pycon this year, which is unfortunate.\u00a0 I'll be hosting Henrique from Brazil as my guest.\n\nCloudbolt is looking for a full stack engineer.\u00a0 The pizza has arrived!\n\nI heard some grumbling that Bonat's version of MVC is treating Visualizations more as reports (final output) than a full interactive GUI controlled by the end-user.\u00a0 In web development, the visualization is more or less synonymous with the web page presentation itself.\n\nErnest's end users are client-recipient of the data analysis, not the real time users of a custom GUI.\u00a0 Ernest himself is happy running his source code directly, given everything is so well organized.\u00a0 For him, Eclipse itself is the GUI.\u00a0 The data went from .csv files into pandas.\u00a0 This was not Big Data in the sense of mapreduce or Hadoop.\n\nDr. Bonat was certainly right to emphasize [unit testing and TDD](http://www.diveintopython3.net/unit-testing.html).\u00a0 When it comes to job interviews, he's looking for well commented, documented solutions that [come with unit tests](http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2004/12/02/tdd_pyunit.html).\u00a0 I need to keep that in mind as [a job hunter](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/05/mondays-game-of-pinball.html).\n\nThe Lightning Talk was also interesting and statistical in nature, though also more number theoretic.\u00a0 How many digits does it take to represent a natural number 1/n, including one digit to designate \"repeating\"?\u00a0 For example 0.5 is 1 digit for 1/2,\u00a0 whereas 0.333... for 1/3 would be 2 digits, as the 3 repeats.\n\nThe speaker, who's name I missed, showed us several plots, including varying the number base.\u00a0 Bases of a 2nd power, like 4 and 9, have special properties apparently.\u00a0 Primes especially often take as many digits as in the base to represent the number.\n\nOn the way to the meetup I was communicating with Trevor about getting him the above materials.\u00a0 I also sent him this link to recent writing, on [4D vs. 4D vs. 4D](http://bit.ly/1TGwb2Q), a theme of my enthno-mathematical investigations.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/27202929581/in/dateposted-public/)",
