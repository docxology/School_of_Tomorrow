  "content": "In the movie reviewed below, Vice, we have a scene wherein they install offices for the veep all over town, which I found appealing.\u00a0 People do that when they move around a lot.\n\nAnyway, my two main perches are Blue House bound, in the sense that I have an outpost on each of two floors.\u00a0 I have some work stations.\n\nWe're talking about a residential type of place, nothing unusual.\u00a0 \"Work station\" is normal parlance for a home office and workspace, where a guest might have a laptop with WiFi.\n\nI've bounced around a lot and had a lot of offices, but as a single individual, I'm bound to a sequential trajectory.\u00a0 I'm not in all places at once, unless we all are, in which case [what point am I making](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/feel-free-to-multitask-9fd7ab290bf3)?\n\nGuests have departed.\u00a0 I visited Peter's model train setup, which is truly cool.\u00a0 Lots of pictures taken.",
