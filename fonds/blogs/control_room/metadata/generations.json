  "content": "They say a generation is twenty years.\u00a0 Twenty years ago I went to the Fuller Centennial in San Diego and wrote this [three part series](http://grunch.net/synergetics/geni1.html).\u00a0 I'm tonight reading [a partially overlapping account](http://www.geni.org/globalenergy/library/newsletters/1995/buckminster-fuller--a-centennial-symposium-and-celebration.shtml).\n\nKen Kesey and the Merry Pranksters were boomers, somewhat post beatnik which was Jack Kerouac's generation.\u00a0 The two met in New York as a part of that bus trip, Leary's group the next stop.\u00a0 Sometimes a Great Notion (Kesey's next novel after Cuckoo's Nest) was being released.\n\nPegging the time.\u00a0 I was in elementary school, starting in Portland, winding up [in Rome](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/machine-world.html).\n\nMy generation was / is late boomer, pre Generation X.\u00a0 When our group had families, those were called Yuppies (young professionals) a play on Hippies.\u00a0 Various neighborhoods gentrified or whatever.\u00a0 Jersey City sure took off, since my day in the early 1980s, as a high school teacher walking to work along Kennedy Boulevard.\n\nI took my daughter to New York and Long Island City that time, to meet with Kenneth Snelson and to take in a ceremony honoring the friendship between Fuller and Isamu Noguchi, a sculptor.\u00a0 Shoji Sadao was another in that crew, a workshop / studio, across from where the Noguchi Museum is today.\n\nMy mom is aiming to be in New York City by tomorrow, for only for a brief stay.\u00a0 She'll be back through on her return.\u00a0 I'm meanwhile soon to set out for the mid-west on company business.\u00a0 My daughter is now twenty, a next generation.\n\nThe Princeton P-rade is worth catching, if you get a chance.\u00a0 The classes parade in order, though with a 25th year group in front (I think is how it goes -- I was there for that one).\u00a0 You see time go by really quickly, a review.\u00a0 The alums get younger and younger, turning into underclassmen at the end.\u00a0 I'm not sure what other universities do that.\u00a0 Pretty interesting.\n\nThe \"march through time\" metaphor (is it a metaphor? -- seems pretty literal) is pretty cliche.\u00a0 Or is it the march of time?\u00a0 Whatever.\u00a0 \"Time is the only dimension\" was one of the tropes I remember from Synergetics.\u00a0 But then time and size go together.\u00a0 One needs room to rattle around.\n\nGiven I was in Rome during the tumultuous 1960s, I had a somewhat different take on things than my three-years-older wife.\u00a0 She had stayed in North America, mostly in the southeast, joining the Portland scene before I did.\n\nMy return to Portland, in 1985 (as I've pegged it, I hope correctly) was after my parents left Bangladesh but then moved to Bhutan, where dad continued his career as a planner / designer, now of education systems, later in Lesotho.\u00a0 When my wife was hired as the bookkeeper for Center for Urban Education, I was away in Bhutan.\u00a0 On a next trip, she and Alexia joined me.\n\nAnyway, if you're curious about my autobio I've got more on file.\u00a0 [Check it out](http://wikieducator.org/User:KirbyUrner/Autobio).",
