  "content": "How many long haul truckers listen to podcasts?\u00a0 I imagine myself chugging along I-whatever listening to satellite radio, but maybe also to some Russian classics, maybe Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy. Having some literary criticism, philosophy, biography, history, mixed in, would [count towards my PhD](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/12/a-phd-in-truckology.html).\u00a0 Driverless trucks don't support learning in this way.\u00a0 My fleet is dual purpose, in providing truckers with personal workspaces (PWSs).\n\nWhat is GST again?\u00a0 That depends whom you ask.\u00a0 Out there in the wild, these three letters match a lot of strings.\u00a0 However, I'm following my Quaker heritage to some degree and connecting with Kenneth Boulding, the economist, and the general systems theory he wrote about.\u00a0 My spin:\u00a0 lets compete with economics as a discipline, since economics itself suggests that monopolies give rise to lots of inefficiencies.\u00a0 Why give economics as a discourse any monopoly say over any aspect of planetary affairs?\n\nOf course my detractors point out that inside economics we have Georgists, Marxists, the Chicago School and so on.\u00a0 If you're driving right now, maybe punch up a podcast on Henry George after awhile?\u00a0 OK, we're talking semantics at this point.\u00a0 If you want to inject GST into the economic sphere as another competing economics, that's fine.\u00a0 As long as you stay competitive.\n\nWhat happened next in my story, is Buckminster Fuller came along with his Spaceship Earth meme, and his practice of thinking globally while acting locally.\u00a0 His idea of \"systems\" was very structural and geometric, as demonstrated by his elaborations on the octet-truss, a fascination for Alexander Graham Bell as well.\u00a0 He got his truss to curve and make the triangular panels of a geodesic dome.\n\nAt the heart of Fuller's thinking was a shape we all probably recognize when we see it, but might not have its name handy: the tetrahedron.\u00a0 Fuller went so far as to imagine a civilization which had shifted its weight from the cube to the tetrahedron to such an extent that it often measured units of volume using tetrahedral shapes (four faces, six points, six edges).\u00a0 He wrote two whole volumes (Synergetics and Synergetics 2) exploring this alternative Universe.\n\nThe \"Sesame Street\" of Synergetics, meaning the core neighborhood wherein we might revisit a lot of partially overlapping topics (much as Children's Television Workshop explored the letters and numbers necessary for cultural literacy) is known as the Concentric Hierarchy, a nesting of well-known polyhedrons.\u00a0 As a former high school teacher, and computer language teacher to this day, I've devoted a lot of resources towards communicating about this Concentric Hierarchy.\u00a0 The topic lends itself to sculpture and modeling.\u00a0 When sharing about it with kids, I'll sometimes use C6XTY, Sam Lanahan's flextegrity construction kit.\u00a0 I have other kits as well, which I truck out during workshops.\n\nWhat got me interested in trucking?\u00a0 Not so long ago, I used a computer language called Visual FoxPro to make my way in the world.\u00a0 I programmed for hospitals, nonprofits, various clients.\u00a0 However, that work dried up, partly because FoxPro was shelved by Microsoft and taken off the market.\u00a0 Meanwhile, thanks to my interest in geometry and Synergetics, I'd been building up my Python skills.\u00a0 What happened next is I met a transportation engineer whose whole business was about using Visual FoxPro to support scheduling and routing in Trucker World.\u00a0 He had a thriving business.\u00a0 He was also interested in using more Python in complement with his Visual FoxPro.\u00a0 He started contracting with me on the side for some apprentice level coding, and giving me insights into the trucking industry from an applications developer viewpoint.\n\nAnother aspect of my childhood and young adulthood, was growing up in areas where Peace Corps volunteers might serve, the Philippines especially.\u00a0 The whole idea of going to distant lands not as a tourist, but as a worker seeking to develop one's skills, was attractive to me.\u00a0 I recall my friend Hugh Thomford going to Fiji to help establish growing pearls as an industry.\u00a0 That might not have been with the Peace Corps, but the idea was similar.\u00a0 Our family was engaged in a similar business.\u00a0 My dad was a planner, urban and regional, who worked with various sovereignties on their long term development plans.\u00a0 These sovereignties included Libya, the Philippines, Bangladesh, Egypt, Bhutan, Lesotho.\n\nWhat if truckers had a way to swap routes.\u00a0 As a driver, I could apprentice in someone else's rig until I got the hang of it.\u00a0 We might have more team driving.\u00a0 You get to know the other person in your cab.\u00a0 You're a diplomat, bringing your ideas and viewpoints into the situation.\u00a0 You're learning about another culture, and another system of roads.\u00a0 Such work wouldn't be for everyone.\u00a0 However, I could see where it might be attractive to some.\u00a0 What better test of GST as a discipline than to apply it to something concrete like this?\n\nThat gives you some background on the various Medium writings, podcasts and whatever, that you may stumble across as a trucker, whether in the Trucker Exchange or not.\u00a0 We also call it Truckers for Peace sometimes.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I'm extending a Quaker lineage in my writings about GST and the Quakers are always looking to remove the causes of war before things get out of hand.\u00a0 Having truckers become more empowered and adept at diplomacy and job sharing is a way of building our shared planetary immune system against meme viruses that lead to outward wars.\n\nWe still suffer from inward wars, psychological battles, so in terms of being a warrior and a hero, that's still a calling.\u00a0 We could use your skills and services.\u00a0 We just hope you'll not have to fall back on using obsolete outward weapons that have nothing to do with improving your psychological health. Many still make a career out of outward weapons but would prefer to do something more creative.\u00a0 My advice:\u00a0 [study GST](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html).",
