  "content": "During the breakout session at the AFSC meeting, people dispersed to various rooms to learn about programs. \u00a0I went to the presentation on some of the prison work that goes on.\n\nThe US has an immature understanding of humans and likes to make everything a morality play with goodies and baddies. \u00a0A lot of this thinking was inherited from England, a likewise under-developed civilization of mediocre collective IQ. \u00a0Organized religion has a lot to do with it.\n\nThe US incarcerates a huge number of people, a growing profit center for many public and private organizations. \n\nPrisoners = free or almost free labor, and compared to the boredom of doing nothing much, many prisoners would prefer to be doing something skillful. \u00a0Making furniture is a chief activity. \u00a0The government itself thrives on slave labor in this way.\n\nCalling it \"slave labor\" is of course loaded. \u00a0The double standards involved warrant the term, some would say.\n\nIdentifying products suitable for boycott because made by prison labor was not\u00a0a strategy suggested by staff. \u00a0Prisoners often prefer work to idleness and would be disappointed to lose their manufacturing jobs. \u00a0Not that they necessarily would, as the USG and state governments are a reliable customer.\n\nChinese consumers should educate themselves on what products for sale in China might be made by US prisoners. \u00a0Whether to boycott or not is an individual choice.\n\nI think school children, if sitting in desks made by prisoners, should be made aware of that fact. \u00a0The study of prisons and prison systems is a great 8th grade topic. \u00a0At Overseas School of Rome, we had Sociology as a subject in middle school. \u00a0Fred Craden was my teacher. \u00a0I don't think most US based schools offer sociology am I right?\n\nOur staff presenters were from New York and Michigan respectively.",
