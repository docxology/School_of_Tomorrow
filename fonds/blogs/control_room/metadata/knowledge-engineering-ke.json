Such devices may be literal objects from everyday experience, such as prescription lenses (personalized to correct for distortions), or more fantastical or abstract.\u00a0\n\nFor example, under Geometry we find the Coupler or \"crazy diamond\" as some would call it. The combinatorics of A and B modules, in their assembly of the space-filling Coupler matrix, is where Bucky himself expected to find particle physics minded proteges, in search of their GUTs and TOEs.\n\nAn entire city may become infused with mnemonic signifiers, both in consensus reality (CR) in the form a statues, memorials, proper named streets, and in non-consensus realities (NCRs), perhaps special to an individual author of specific novels. I'm thinking of James Joyce and Dublin of course.\n\nPortland, favored by the movie and TV industries, has been weirdly lensed through several fictional series, most famously Portlandia, officially comic satire.\n\nThe idea of an entirely open source farm becomes pretty all-encompassing once we factor in the computer chips we're using.\u00a0\n\nThe apps target smartphones, so those have to be open as well.\u00a0\n\nThe apps control or at least schedule the tractors, the irrigation systems, some of the bookkeeping. Transparency in accounting is also required.\u00a0\n\nWho would do this? A university wanting to show off the \"model farm\" with no deceptive tricks, perhaps. Or a government in the business of proving ideal cases, which the private sector might learn from.",
