  "content": "Given I\u2019m of the Quaker persuasion (there\u2019s a more formal name) my angle on politics is who cheerleads wars? These are the ones I\u2019m biased to disown, but I train myself to hear their arguments, partly so I understand what I\u2019m up against. Usually people who cheerlead for war are coming from a victim mindset, which typically involves wanting vengeance and redress, fantasizing about having someone get their comeuppance and so forth. That\u2019s the pattern. Does this mean Quakers don\u2019t play victim? Of course we do. Speaking as a victim is like a tense in the language, akin to the subjunctive.\u00a0Quakerism is more a monkey-bars / jungle gym of potentially beneficial workout practices, doing committee work, than it is a geopolitical ideology.\u00a0Hatched in the 1600s, it knows nothing of many 21st Century obsessions. Yet committee work in support of a Meeting (a kind of business) remains an important opportunity.Work out in a Quaker gym, so to speak, and you\u2019ll probably become a more effective hotelier or restaurateur, because you were already not an avatar of violence, and therefore receptive to our teachings.\u00a0However, if you\u2019re an advocate for war, yet wish the attention of our Overseers (supervisors), don\u2019t presume that your victimhood will go unchallenged, if indeed that\u2019s what\u2019s driving your despicable warmongering.",
