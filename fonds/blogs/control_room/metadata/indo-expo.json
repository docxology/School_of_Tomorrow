Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Grenada... and that's just in the \"backyard\" (where a lot of the fruit and vegetables come from).\n\nLets remember that many \"governments\" (i.e. the \"gangs in charge\"), if wanting to stay eligible for Drug War money (to buy weapons), which the US dispenses with largess, need to kill, maim and imprison their own people, just like the Big Daddy USA does.\n\nHaving extorted money for weapons from drug-using US Americans (mostly prescription, pushed on TV), the USG then uses it in Afghanistan to destroy lucrative opium crops, and cocaine crops in Latin America.\u00a0 Ruthlessly destroying the competition is what \"capitalism\" is all about.\n\nThis ongoing destruction of infrastructure and local economies is done in the name of Christianity as well in many cases, as religion hates competition from medications.\u00a0 Priests alone must do the healing.\u00a0 Remember what Marx said about \"opium of the people\"?\u00a0 Exactly.\n\nOther insecure religions besides Christianity fear the competition, from entheogens in particular.\u00a0 Only the officially designated and approved authorities should mediate between the masses and the many varieties of religious experience.\u00a0 That usually means psychiatrists, or priests, not shamans.\n\nDemonizing drugs not authorized by state licensed practitioners, the ones who play the game and pay for the privilege, is the point of endless propaganda campaigns.\n\nNow that Oregon has licensed its growers and sellers (many of them), there's a ceasefire in the demonizing, as there's money to be made.\u00a0 The bankers are especially miffed, as they're under pressure from the Feds to not play on the \"wrong side\". But then which side is the losing side?\n\nYears of Prohibition turned US Americans into criminals and scofflaws pretty much across the board.\u00a0 As Americans, we're used to thinking of laws as tools of oppression, meant to be broken, with pride and a clear conscience.\u00a0 Laws against interracial marriage were about dividing and conquering the workforce.\u00a0 In retrospect. Apartheid looks like Jim Crow which looks like Nazi Germany.\n\nThe stereotypical cannabis users (or \"stoner\") has not even a smidgen of guilt or remorse for indulging in such \"depraved\" (i.e. \"sinful\") activity.\u00a0 They're typically not bombing and terrorizing others, so actually feel morally superior to those doing the bidding of company slave masters.\n\nThe USG is relatively easy to demonize on the other hand.\u00a0 It's really hard to see why anyone would want to be a US president.\u00a0 Why have something that ugly on one's resume?\u00a0 Who wants to brag about being [a warlord](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profiles/blogs/an-abolitionist-president)?",
