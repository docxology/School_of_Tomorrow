  "content": "Judging from the non-starter screenwriting, some cabal wanted us to link a domestic case of poisoning to a war theater gas attack, and use this as some kind of excuse to start a major gamble, which this cabal was thinking might help get them ahead.\u00a0 Desperate outsiders, these cabalists.\n\nThe police are getting better at working in concert, as are the militaries.\u00a0 They know politicians have the dubious job of inciting violence, and that the people supposedly enthralled by political soap operas are chomping at the bit for social cues.\u00a0 But that's not working, and insofar as \"mainstream media\" plays along, it becomes ever more phony-sounding.\n\nWe're wise to the fact that tiny minorities are trying to start something.\u00a0 If not in Mesopotamia, then in Korea.\u00a0 If not in Korea then somewhere else.\u00a0 Jobs depend on keeping a war time economy in high gear.\u00a0 Other jobs depend on having that war economy business make room for a next generation of weapons inspectors and cleanup gurus.\n\nThe intelligence community, such as there is one (pretty tenuous), is engaged in counter-intelligence against war-hungry cabalists.\u00a0 They'd have you believe otherwise, as a way cabalists (members of a cabal) impress others with their power is to pretend overwhelming forces are on their side, including God if that's at all credible.\n\nWe don't need horrible violence to sustain a good life for the tiny few.\u00a0 I know many still believe that's the case and get anxious when the horrible violence abates even a little.\u00a0 If any religions feel like playing a role, it might be to disown the nukes.\n\nIf you're at all God fearing, [don't coddle your ego](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/05/quaker-affairs.html) with fantasies of owning and controlling weapons of mass destruction.\u00a0 Grow beyond needing that junkyard.\u00a0 Heal from being an outward weapons junkie.\n\nNot that we want Armageddon to start at the hands of unbelievers either.\u00a0 Our belief is God wills us not to make a mockery of Judgement Day, by staging it ourselves.\u00a0 Or call it teleological pressure, some Fury of Being.",
