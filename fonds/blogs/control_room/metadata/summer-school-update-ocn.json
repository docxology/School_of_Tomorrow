  "content": "I'm not involved in any of the civic unrest taking place in my City of Portland, although I am commenting from my crow's nest on Facebook.\n\nMy experience with Occupy, which echoed the Smedley Butler Hoovervilles, right down to Elk Park, was in no way a positive indicator that I'd be at the vanguard of some smashing fest.\u00a0 We operated with precision and although we trampled the park, we channeled a lot of amps.\u00a0 The park bounced back, complete with restrooms.\n\nI'd be for reopening the pavillions (not gazebos exactly), [such as in Colonel Summers](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/06/privatizing-public-parks.html) and kitty corner from Cleveland High School, without ending social distancing.\u00a0 Maybe these could be dispensaries for the free government cell phones we're all getting along with testing, that will let us avail of social services, and vote.\u00a0 Just lapsing into science fiction there for a sec.",
