  "content": "Perhaps the hallmark of the \"modern European nation\" in terms of liberalism is \nit doesn't conceive of itself as being in orbit around (controlled by) \nany one ethnicity (whatever the one).\u00a0\n\nIsrael stands out as the hallmark \nethnic state, and as such is the envy of many.  But\n then Israel is not in Europe and Saudi Arabia is just as ethnocentric \nin its own way (we should talk about Britain more).\u00a0\n\nThe American ideal \nis closest to having \"race creed\" etc. not matter on paper, even if in \npractice people are jerks.\u00a0\n\nThis is why any talk of \"Ukraine for \nUkrainians, make us be in Europe now!\" sounds so oxymoronic.  The \nEuropeans think:  \"you must be civilized first, and treat the Russians \nas equals\" to which the Ukrainians reply \"wait, don't you hate the \nRussians too?\" which to many is the clinching argument.\u00a0\n\nWhat we need is\n more agreement on \"totalitarianism is bad\" (dystopian) without all the \nold branding.  We've outgrown the old comic books.\n\nWhat I'd remind Ukrainians of is that we're ethnically Russian over here too, in America.\u00a0\n\nNot only Russian, obviously.\u00a0\n\nLots of Ukes. Lots of Ruskies.\u00a0\n\nWe've learned to live together.\u00a0\n\nSometimes I think Euros falsely conclude, based on clown shows in DC and recycled NATO propaganda, that America is foundationally Russophobic. To those with such a shallow understanding I'd say: keep digging. History is more complicated than good versus bad.\u00a0\n\nIf you moralize a lot (or too quickly?), consider you might be a dummy.\n\nXREF:\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStatecraft: the Crafting of States\nRebuilding Ukraine\nBreakaway Republics\nEthnocentrism",
