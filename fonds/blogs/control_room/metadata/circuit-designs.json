Hoover) and there's no branch of that type in your area?\u00a0 Up a creek without a paddle?\n\nI might propose the term Limbo Quakers for those caught with no Monthly Meeting, for one reason or another.\u00a0 Disownment, resignation, or never achieving clearness in the first place, on the part of the meeting maybe, could all be reasons for remaining a Limbo Friend.\u00a0 Your meeting was not ready for your \"relationship\" or your \"family\".\n\n[Like on American Dad](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/12/american-dad-plot-synopsis.html):\u00a0 there's an ET in that family, what does the Bible say about ETs?\u00a0 Can ETs become Quakers?\u00a0 No human being is illegal (AFSC's contention), so all aliens must be legal aliens, unless they're not human.\n\nThere's a Catch-22 in all this.\u00a0 Someone is convinced they're a Quaker of exactly the type described in the Faith and Practice of meeting X, but meeting X is far away, and one of the criteria for membership in meeting X is geographic proximity.\u00a0 You need to participate in the life of the meeting, get to know the folks, before they welcome you with open arms.\u00a0 There's a process.\u00a0 But you need to be there.\n\nSuppose a family moves close to meeting X (like choosing a school district) precisely to access the Religious Society through this chosen front door, only to relocate back to wherever?\n\nAnd there's no friendly meeting where they go back to.\n\nMust they surrender membership in meeting X then?\u00a0 Not usually.\u00a0 Hand-offs are to friendly meetings.\u00a0 Limbo Quakers are left alone, as \"isolated Friends\".\n\nThat doesn't mean local Quakers are unfriendly (though it may).\u00a0 It might mean there simply aren't any local Friends.\n\nFriends are obscure, especially the non-pastoral variety (are they even Christian? -- it's not all or nothing).\u00a0 Why should there be Friends locally?\u00a0 It's not a given.",
