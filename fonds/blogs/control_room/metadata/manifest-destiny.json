VanDevelder's exhaustively researched book uses the Cross family story \u2014 and Raymond Cross's eventual transformation into Coyote Warrior, the term given to a growing group of Ivy League\u2013trained lawyers working on American Indian rights issues \u2014 to help trace the century-long struggle of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara tribes to protect their North Dakota homelands.",
