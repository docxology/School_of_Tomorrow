  "content": "We got a ton of boo hoos and bemoanings, of time lost and skills wasted, especially from two income families, which is most of them.\u00a0 Not all of them get to keep their Zoom jobs, nor the kids.\u00a0 Enough \"remote time\", back to school.\u00a0 Good news for all.\n\nExcept a tiny minority of kids had some interesting adventures from the safety of a Zoom job, which is what we gave them, in place of classroom TinyDesks [tm] and a storage locker plan.\u00a0 They got to be more like adults and in many cases got exposed to more real world relevant learning, sans the bullying, sans the insipid nature of the day care center's fake school.\n\nNow I'm only using that language to empathize with that tiny minority, who had a good experience trying distance education.\u00a0 We're told the vast majority hated lock down (who wouldn't, that's prison talk) and now have a built in reason to need remediation going forward.\u00a0 The ones who thrived are not the ones making news, that much seems obvious.\n\nAs a teacher during that period, I went from middle to high school level in a hurry.\u00a0 Drilling down in Python the way the schools envision, in big computer labs, in the day care setting, is different from staying home in a privileged nerd cave with high bandwidth.\u00a0 We were clearly happier here, with our JupyterLab dashboard, in the high school of tomorrow.\u00a0 I could use the same pedagogical techniques I used with adults, and andragogy often makes good pedagogy, I think any Muppet lover will tell you.\n\nSome kids have continued with day camp, putting in nonstandard hours and not riding the bus everywhere.\u00a0 Having kids off the streets, in cubicles, learning, more hours of the day than not, might be a good use of cubicles, if we ever decide the TinyDesks [tm] are not enough.\u00a0 Shared MakerSpaces.\u00a0 Elevators to classrooms on other floors, for when debate teams meet.\u00a0 But debates could be on Zoom as well no?\u00a0 When exactly do we need an auditorium?\n\nI'm saying only a minority of education planners are given skyscraper type buildings to think about, as mixed use structures.\u00a0 My model is more people spread about around town in more traditional dwelling units, more like the one I'm in, where the giant walnut trees fall.\u00a0 High wind today.\u00a0 One fell.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/51688096653/in/dateposted-public/)",
