  "content": "Even in Windows XP I was able to get VPython working on Python 3.2 in a virtualenv, editing through PyCharm.\u00a0 Then I pip installed redis just to prove I could do it, having spent much of the morning reading up on that.\u00a0 Looks like interprocess JSON with persistence.\u00a0 I didn't understand about messaging as my client seemed to block on listening, so how was that gonna help?\u00a0 WinXP has both server and client, though not recommended for production use.\n\nA blooming buzzing garden of such tools and toys, running in ensemble, with simple demo code, pared down, for teaching purposes, is what Free Geek might help staff, if not host.\u00a0 OSDL?\u00a0 There needs to be something more contemporary than a museum, although there's no rule against museums being contemporary, so maybe that's not right.\u00a0 Portland Knowledge Lab was how I used to refer to it, copying London's (where I'd given a presentation on my way to a meeting), but I let that go out of focus when the Active Space experiment ended, in disillusionment with Metro Wifi.\n\nMy audience or client base, updating from CUE days, are still those do-gooder nonprofits and idealists.\u00a0 But we're not in Kansas anymore, using WordPerfect + dBase (my \"good old days\").\u00a0 Today, it's more about mod_wsgi (still) and Tornado and noSQL.\u00a0 The clay, the source, is all out there.\u00a0 \"Use the source Luke\" is the new commandment.\u00a0 But are we getting anywhere?\u00a0 Is STEM gaining in traction?\n\nRedis has you talking through a port, I gather through sockets.\u00a0 Surely those aren't HTTP requests.\u00a0 No, it has its own protocol.\u00a0 Like JSON in that respect.\u00a0 The guarantee is transactions are atomic, as this is one thread (each redis instance).\u00a0 You could probably sell seats with this thing, and not promise the same one to any more than one.\n\nBefore that, I was boning up on gevent + gunicorn, a hot new way to serve processes.\u00a0 I couldn't tell if I'd use Celery in addition to or in lieu of, but I get the idea:\u00a0 lots of event loops running in user space, context switching there, rather than kernel space (the mod_wsgi solution).\u00a0 I watched a talk on Blip.TV comparing that dynamic duo with more traditional solutions.\u00a0 Where high availability is concerned, gevent + gunicorn is looking pretty good, a plus for Python.\n\nI've got DjangoCon on my radar.\u00a0 Should I duplicate this WinXP configuration on Lion?\u00a0 Yes, that would seem prudent.\u00a0 The PyCharm product is something I might get an academic discount on, once we've completed a work process, but for now I'm just using on free 30 day trial.\u00a0 Will it use Akbar font if I like, is a next question.\u00a0 I'll get back to y'all when I figure that out.",
