  "content": "Oh boring, boring, what will they think of next?\u00a0 Yes, [it's a real thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory), and here's a predictable link to Wikipedia. I got criticized in an academic context for being that mundane, however in my defense, I wrote the bulk of that encyclopedia entry ([Synergetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller)), disambiguated to Fuller's version, as in Buckminster).\n\nMy aim though is to be motivational in the sense of offering content of relevance to your personal calendar and how you structure the time in your day.\u00a0 Having unstructured time is a fine thing too. It's not like we all plan to the minute, and so on.\u00a0 If you're planning on using a transportation system, sticking to their published schedule, after finding it, is a skill you might want.\n\nWith so many demands on your time, how should you juggle them?\u00a0 For a moment, be that \"soccer mom\" even if you aren't one.\u00a0 You'll have other people's kids under your supervision.\u00a0 That's a heavy responsibility right there.\u00a0 Not only commanding generals in a military theater have responsibility for their wards.\u00a0 I'm just saying:\u00a0 life gets stressful and if you're a soccer mom, you feel many demands on your time, and your vehicle (Subaru?\u00a0 Volvo?).\n\nIn Uncle Sam Ville (USV), we're told the British are excellent queuers and in fact they're the primary architects of the queue.\u00a0 In America, we \"wait in line\".\u00a0 But think how it works:\u00a0 sometimes the store has multiple checkers, or the bank has multiple tellers, but there's a single cue up to that point.\u00a0 Have you ever checked in at a busy airport?\u00a0 You'll be that person next in line waiting to hear any ticket counter up or down the line call \"next!\" (and you're it!).\n\nTo kick a task down the road, to schedule it some time from now, is not \"procrastination\" (a self punishing word) so much as \"orchestration\" (something Python does too).\u00a0 You can't do everything at once, duh, and you have a sense of a story unfolding.\u00a0 You're not the author by yourself, however you do have some choice when it comes to narrative.\u00a0 What tense should you use?\u00a0 Are we still together?\u00a0 Did we really break up a year ago?\u00a0 When do I make time for Y?\n\nWe could talk strategies, how much to write down, what to add to your calendar.\u00a0 A lot of people use calendars quite habitually to get them through to a next week.\u00a0 You have calls to return, bases to touch base with.\u00a0 You're staying on the radar, filing flight plans.\u00a0 In a busy airspace, people appreciate your being communicative.\u00a0 They're into echo-location themselves and if everyone's in stealth mode, all you get is more bats colliding.\n\nIn a bigger drama, where the goal was to build a lot of seagoing vessels in a hurry, operations research stood to the task and of course people discovered \"multi-tasking\" in various forms, always a temptation to bleep over as a topic, given so much has been said about it.\n\nDon't begrudge the Brits their \"queues\" even if you call them \"lines\" is my advice.\u00a0 More soon.",
