Of parts, not that many, but \"many\" is a concept to get one's head around also.\u00a0 An appreciation for the sheer volume of the data being managed may be illuminating as well (in the sense of instructive).\u00a0\n\nOnce in a real knowledge domain, the data often starts getting bigger, even if the business logic remains more or less constant over time.\u00a0 The same rules come to apply to more and more special cases -- not that rules never change.\n\nFortunately, and just in time when we needed it most, we often now get to learn new skills by downloading substantive example files, as it's not a matter of \"wasting paper\" like in the old days.\u00a0 The move towards Open Data is a way to balance higher rates of collection.\u00a0 Enriching the commons with more shared data provides more reality checks which presumably better guides public policy.\n\nHaving substantive files, such as William Shakespeare's works, or even just [tiny maps of the genetic code](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2015-December/011351.html), also helps us keep the bandwidth high.\u00a0 You're not just learning some computer language, you're being reminded of what you learned about genetics.\n\nSharing bread and butter data from different disciplines, not phony nonsense examples, helps keep a subject matter grounded, and gives people more windows into one another's spheres of concern.\n\nYes, I understand the utility of \"meaningless story problems\" designed to call attention to what's most generalizable, the core concepts and techniques. By the same token, peppering one's teaching with real-world-flavored examples has valid uses as well.\u00a0 It's not either / or.",
