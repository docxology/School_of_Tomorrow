  "content": "I'm at a low key good bye party for Steve Holden, who comes and goes from Portland quite a lot, but with this departure having a penultimate flavor.\u00a0 We look forward to having him back in 2015.\n\nSteve lent some serious technology to the Blue House:\u00a0 a color printer, now in the Buddha Room, and an Apple computer, to which I added an HDMI monitor and USB keyboard.\u00a0 Lindsey uses this setup, freeing my Samsung tablet for use as my reader.\u00a0 I bought Dataclysm this evening.\n\nI'm chauffeuring Steve to PDX tomorrow morning.",
