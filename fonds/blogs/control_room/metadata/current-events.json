UK I mean.\u00a0 BP, whatever.\u00a0 I don't saddle Uncle Sam (US) with the blame, mainly because he's long dead. A resurrection story might be in the cards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs a global OS (operating system), USA values have worked their way into the woodwork, with the grain of popular public opinion.\u00a0 That's not nothing.\u00a0 Democracy still smells like roses, even if still over some distant horizon at this point.\u00a0\n\nHow is the human brain a democracy?\u00a0 Some would say it's not, but I'm not so sure, starting with the bicameral nature of the design.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn practice, democracy seems to feature polarity, meaning warring factions, meaning opposition.\u00a0 Where there's opposition we find alliances and yes, \"strange bed partners\" (they'd mix it up at the Grange too -- what those dances symbolized, about life as a process).\n\nDoes opposition among the parts result in a dynamic equilibrium at the level of the whole?\u00a0 Most true cyberneticists will certainly posit that possibility, and even give examples, such as the adversarial court system.\u00a0 That's not to say every warring mess of factions evolves into a self governing self assembly.\u00a0 A kind of phase change occurs at that point.\n\nBeyond the left-right brain dichotomy and the proverbial war between the lobes (is it proverbial?), we have other internal brain organs.\u00a0 Calling the brain a \"single organ\" is semantics more than logic.\u00a0 Much as a car engine disassembles into separate subsystems, so do brains.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou might say \"that's an oligarchy then\" and I might agree with you.\u00a0 A democracy is never so simplistic as one voter, one vote.\u00a0 The term has more to do with its rate of turnover and anti-fragility.\u00a0 Like the blockchain, in principle, its tough for any one faction to pin it down.\u00a0 You can only fool so many people for so long, to dumb down a well known Lincolnism.\n\nA lot of landlords are coming under scrutiny for their decisions to endanger the rest of us for their personal benefit.\u00a0 I'm talking about the warlord train owners and their devil may care attitudes.\u00a0 Suppose the devil does indeed care?\u00a0 Did you really want that kind of attention?",
