However, yesterday, Saturday (Seventh Day) was pure entertainment:  an easy drive from closer to Canada along I-5, and time with Matt and Lindsey watching Michael Hagmeier and his band, opening for a really good Blues bunch.  This was at Roots on 7th in their bigger venue.  Oh yeah, and [I cut my face](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/11/galumphing-back.html).So today I need to keep getting it out there, lobbying to upgrade Earthling Math with something more palatable, [spiced up a bunch](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/11/spice-trade.html), like with a little Dave's Insanity Sauce (a popular kitchen condiment in this household, in small doses).If [T-modules](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/playing-with-blocks.html) seem boring to you, that's probably because we don't have a lot of good quality geometry animations about them yet, much as I've been agitating for same for commercial purposes.We also have the E modules with h=1, really close to T's radius 0.99948333226... [as computed by Python](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-November/009678.html) just now and obtained by scaling [phi/root2](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/re-k-mods-etc.html), which latter radius gives us [a rhombic triacontahedron](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/10/nclb-polyhedron-memo.html) of 7.5 (in tetravolumes).  That's what's showing in the screen shots below.So here's a little Show & Tell with links to the cited graphics for more background, [also source code](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/tmod.py):[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEghzw-PM7xu2IWTqCRmid3X5pOeeIKwKTiGaq8Oq_VEDJOmWyWt7hhe16HCcSfl1RB5j_quNlIIFa4g4y6VmuORr9PgwBb4pz_BEKIU-qTE-W_188vt5v0N_NrwPSztlp6GxBwr/s1600/tmod3.png):: lengths AC, BC, OC from linked [figure ](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86411a.html)[986.411A](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86411a.html) ::[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0w0oCBFfdD-EsAoX8ATBPJaxjlvAouVKq2FuM8398zsDEp8ogM5S_QDl0x01UiQr8G8Tsf0lObezfqKF9HikqRSW9ZAEd8ug6kmbbkRjQeooDZn7X_HP-cDhXiDIQ3IPcHLVc/s1600/tmod2.png):: using Python's Decimal type, setting context to 31 digits ::[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgvF1nRLrJX7BB2_QrkL-16PFQ4mkukUggEQOGEbUs8pQVU5HEuMOU1mUFy8qVauN4iqxsov1RX1z24z9hE5WySRdDcrw8Vc4FySwlNevgBQj9cmx4jJMxoia8hh7B9Qyoa0RwE/s1600/tmod4.png):: T-mod plane net [using turtle.py](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/4147429781/sizes/o/) in Python 3.1 (WinXP) ::[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgb3a2jCDQ_xa7r59nkmHzv6DWu-Hu0-GCNm-gZV5cnhvaZq7BjL-8hADV0tzG8Ws5XO7wkqDo5SSGcHdEpiSrmTtqUjLux55OVJlTPntOUbdfcRBgGxU3PZQJhl2mDJ8xIiL65/s1600/tmod5.png):: controlling a [standard library turtle](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-November/009682.html) ::Cited Figures:  [Synergetics Constant](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86210.html); [986.411A T-Mod Edges](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86411a.html); [986.411B T-Mod Angles](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86411b.html)",
