He left home at sixteen and eventually found work as a teacher and choral director. \n\nWhen the Civil War broke out he rushed to Cincinnati's defense. He then signed up with the Union Army and was in many battles, dwindling to only a hundred and forty pounds at six foot five.\n\nHe ended up in the orbit of Fisk University, an enterprise he could support and that eventually led to the Jubilee Singers. \n\nElla Shepherd became the heart of this enterprise, of Cherokee as well as Afro-slave heritage (her mother was sold away as a slave a couple times, though they were eventually reunited).\n\nThe choir went on many grueling road trips, and became a real money-maker for Fisk, as well as other institutions.\n\nI'm tracking the Brexit referendum through Twitter too, and like many in my network, wonder if Scotland feels chained to a jumper. \u00a0What if Scottish folks [prefer to stay in the EU](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/12/brexit-would-trigger-second-scottish-referendum-within-three-yea/), but maybe opt out of NATO? \n\nScots don't get much benefit from obeying the Trident submarine conqueror-invaders, as some see them. \u00a0The Nukehead Nations are on the [wrong side of history](https://greens.scot/news/trident-debate-chance-to-say-no-to-nato-and-yes-to-peace/) these days. \u00a0Nations remaining innocent of nukes get more respect.\u00a0 Those who cling to them seem stupid.\n\nOf course suggesting \"Scotland\", an inanimate object, has \"feelings\" is venturing into the realm of corporate personhood. \u00a0What used to be a mere metaphor might today have legal implications. \n\nMost people still understand nation-state talk as a shorthand, not a metaphysics, nor a theory about the sentience of AI monster-creatures.\n\nWe had a number of musicians in the audience tonight, who asked intelligent questions.\u00a0 Jubilee Singers past and present, may be found on Youtube.\n\nHere's Peter's preamble, circulated ahead of the presentation:\n\nJUBILEE! In 1871 a bedraggled group of ten black students from Nashville'sFisk University, among the first black colleges founded after the Civil war,set out for Ohio to try to save Fisk from bankruptcy by giving concerts.when these Jubilee Singers disbanded, they were professional, world-travelled adults, having brought the Negro spiritual to the knowledge of the wider world, singing before American presidents and European monarchs. They had raised $150,000 to save Fisk and other black colleges from disbanding, and to build the Fisk campus. Illuminated by careful records and by letters and diaries of the singers, it is an improbable story of success over adversity and an illuminating saga of race in America. My great-grandfather, George White, was the Jubilees' founder and leader, and their story was an important part of my family heritage growing up in the Jim Crow south.",
