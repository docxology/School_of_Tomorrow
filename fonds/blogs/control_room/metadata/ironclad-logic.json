Mix in some Arab Spring vibe, some Occupy, and keep the Syrians free of invaders from the sky. \n\nThe Syrian refugees are being pushed out by people who covet their lands.\u00a0 We learn simply by seeing who takes the vacant apartments.\u00a0 Make everything too violent for a middle class to tolerate, and take over.\u00a0 That's the streets of New York.\u00a0 We saw it in Aleppo.\u00a0 Just arm everyone to the teeth and stoke hostilities and you're in business.\n\nNo one suggests turning it off at the spigot, where the factories spew arms by the box car full, day after day.\u00a0 To pay a fortune for an arsenal and not use it, not need it?\u00a0 The public needs theater to justify the expense.\u00a0 They need to see themselves being the good guys.\u00a0 It's a lot of expensive fireworks, but what else works?\u00a0 If shareholders are going to stay in the money, we'll need to showcase why our products are truly worth the expense.\u00a0 How's that for ironclad logic?\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/43732609975/in/dateposted-public/)",
