  "content": "The above screencast, by David Koski, was meant to have sound.\n\nHe narrated over the phone what was going on.\n\nI thought I could keep it in my head, but the zig-zag pattern of three tetrahedrons in the frustum is frustrating to memorize.\n\nStart with ye regular old tetrahedron then move a face outward from its opposite vertex to make the edges phi (1.618...) times what they were.\n\nThe three zig zag tetrahedrons inside are now 1/phi, 1, phi in ratio, where 1 = the volume of the original tetrahedron.\n\nYou may generalize this result to non-regular tetrahedrons.\n\nRelated reading:\n[Constructing the Desert Tetrahedron](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/SYNERGEO/conversations/topics/71508) (Dec, 2013)\n[Multiplying Desert Tetrahedron by PHI](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/SYNERGEO/conversations/topics/71509) (Dec, 2013)",
