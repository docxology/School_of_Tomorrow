  "content": "I appreciate how kids behave, on a different stratum from adults, a different frequency. I think carving out \"childhood\" as its own culture, versus going for \"little adults\" has beaucoup advantages, at the risk of annoying those tiny tyrants ready to wield power at a precious age.\n\nGags on Youtube or the like, little skits, in which we imitate kid behavior expertly, while transposing it to an adult world, might prove illuminating.\u00a0 Like I had a kid on his back under desks messing with co-workers' power and Internet access.\u00a0 Imagine some guy in a suit and tie doing that, jumping out of his cubicle and switching off the lights, just for starters.\n\nWe let little kids get away with a lot.\u00a0 They're obviously unarmed, or so we presume.\u00a0 The terms on which we meet are semi-voluntary, in my case often a day care setting, meaning parents need time to complete their day job assignments before resuming parenting duties during the evening and night hours, unless on night shift, and so on.\u00a0 Older kids often walk home and no one says they can't enjoy domestic life sans parents bossing them around...\n\nAnyway, no need to paint the entire sociological picture on a tiny postage stamp of a blog post.\u00a0 I'm just thinking of video clip episodes of high didactic value and what those might look like.\u00a0 I'm not in favor of people not reading.\u00a0 Boosting the effectiveness of said clips is in no way to diss screenwriting skills.\u00a0 We work together, we the graphical and lexical.\u00a0 We're called your hemispheres.\u00a0 Your brain, dummy.",
