  "content": "Yes, I too admired this film for its cleverness and compassion.\n\nAs she gets older though, and even while young, I think those five archetypes don't quite cover it.\u00a0 Maybe we would find some mutant sixth and seventh crew members in different people?\n\nWe take only a small sample, with N only > 10 towards the end, if it ever gets that high (cross species, nice touch).\u00a0 I'm talking about how we look in on different control rooms.\u00a0 Always the same five?\n\nThis Disney / Pixar movie is the paradigm \"control room\" movie, taking the meme right to its psychological roots, as a source of core memories feeding complexes (\"military industrial\" or whatever). \n\nShades of Woody Allen right?\n\nLong term memories get visited later, by an estranged headquarters pair, seeking to get back to the helm.\u00a0 Not giving too much away.\n\nShe's a ship in choppy waters, our girl, and through an extended and elaborate set of interlocking metaphors, we get an excursion through a detailed mind map.\n\nEither that (more crew) or each of these five might need to stretch a bit more, to take in new territory?\u00a0 The subconscious covers a lot of ground... I'm maybe just unclear about the plumbing.\u00a0 \n\nI admit the prospect of a sequel somewhat scares me.\u00a0 What if the series catches up and passes me?\u00a0 It gets scarier doesn't it?\u00a0 San Francisco is just the beginning.\u00a0 Maybe [The Zero Theorem](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-zero-theorem-movie-review.html) fits here?\n\nOK, I'm angsting a bit, have some concerns of my own.\u00a0 Maybe I'm a tad envious of little girls and the problems they get to have?\u00a0 Sniff.\u00a0 You've gotta admit she has it pretty good, just having so much joy for starters.\u00a0 Her parents have benefited, a stress point right there.\n\nHey, I'm looking forward to Minions.\n\nTwas fun to see this on a big screen with a friend in an audience.\u00a0 I had my book on [cryptography and Poe](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/06/recent-news-and-readings.html) along, taking the bus, got a ride back in a new Mercedes.\n\nWe get more from a spontaneously shared event in a dark movie hall, than watching on a flat screen home alone.\n\nNot that I don't welcome the more kicked-back option; I do that too.\u00a0 I'm glad I have the option to choose.\u00a0 Did I mention seeing Jurassic World with Alexia?\n\nThis is one I'd gladly add to my collection.",
