B. Koski.\n\nHe takes the LCD triangles (spherical) of the 31 great circle Icosahedron, which relate to the 25 of the cuboctahedron, and turns them into plane nets about four modules:\u00a0 the E (each a 1/4 slice of the 30 rhombus 120 LCD triangle Rhombic Triacontahedron, radius 1); then: Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum (taking pronunciations from the fairy tale).\n\nA shared edge of the Fe and Fi, which latter has E's volume \"phi down\" (phi^-3 scale factor), has a length we've taken to calling the S Factor, likewise the ratio of VE:Icosa both of Jitterbug fame, and of S-to E-mods (S/E): about 1.08.\n\nThe icosahedron embedded within the volume 4 octahedron, of edges 2, from whence the S modules are carved, has edges that same length?\u00a0 I hadn't tuned that in.\u00a0 I'll use Python as a kind of spreadsheet, or dataframe, to explore more in that direction.\n\nIn this way, I'm able to keep my fingers on a keyboard, composing with mathematical concepts, while staying in shape for my morning and evening seminars, not to mention the time in schools.\n\nI'm a big believer in a varied diet, so I'm not painting the above regime as some frieze of the rest of my life.\u00a0 However, I think having coding and/or geometry as a frequent mental activity serves the same role as walking a mile a day or visiting the gym.\n\nUse it or lose it right?\n\nThat's what the professors really mean when they say \"publish or perish\" as usually how we know you haven't lost it, are using it, is we get to peer review.\n\nThe S Factor should not be confused with S3, Fuller's published constant for volumetric conversion between a Cartesian XYZ cube of edges sqrt(2) i.e. sqrt(2)^3, and an IVM-based cube with the same edges, but embracing a different \"unit of volume\", in this case a 2-edged Tetrahedron.\n\nThanks to a theorem, the IVM volume (tetravolume) is of said tetrahedron-embracing cube is 3, giving 3 / sqrt(2)^3 as our S3 \"currency conversion\" ratio of about\u00a01.060660171779821 (as computed in Python), see\u00a0Table 986.209.\n\n982.32\u00a0 The cube formed by a uniform width, breadth, and height of sqrt(2) is sqrt(2^3), which = 2.828428. Therefore, the cube occurring in nature with the isotropic vector matrix, when conventionally calculated, has a volume of 2.828428.\nAn interesting discovery of Koski's regarding S3 is it's also the ratio of SuperRT / VE, i.e. the classic D-edged VE of tetravolume 20, in a Jitterbug relationship with D-edged Icosahedron, when multiplied by S3, gives the volume of the RT formed by said Icosa and its dual, the Pentagonal Dodecahedron (we call that SuperRT, \"phi up\" from the 120 E-modules RT).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/37897977156/in/dateposted-public/)\n\n:: left to right: Fum, Fo, Fi, Fe ::",
