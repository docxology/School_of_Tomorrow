  "content": "A lot of the groups I participate in hold Zoom meetings way more often than I'm able to attend. The 52 Living Ideas network has an especially cram packed schedule. I'm assuming this is the usual pattern.\u00a0Groups that record their meetups provide their participants with more opportunities to keep tabs, plus generate material for lurkers, would be new recruits. 52 Living Ideas and M4W both record the majority of their meetups. TrimTab Book Club only rarely does. FieldStructure Institute is somewhere in between.This particular M4W meetup is about Curious Listening Meetups, which have a specific format and code of conduct. We talk about Bohmian Dialog quite a bit. I bring up [Dr. Nick Consoletti](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/05/twenty-one-guns.html), who did his PhD on that topic. We have another Bohm fan in our midst, John Brett.Aslam is from the Pashtun region and is joining us as a PhD candidate at Princeton, with a background in conflict resolution. We have a series of meetups he leads, focusing more directly of Sociology as a discipline. He questions to what degree we decide our direction unconsciously, given how intentionally and deliberately he's been operating as a decision-maker on a spiritual journey.",
