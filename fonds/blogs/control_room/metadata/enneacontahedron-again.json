  "content": "Finding omni-symmetrical polyhedrons with volumes close to the sphere's volume, while having the same radius in some important direction, has been a preoccupation of some geometers, David Koski among them.  Sir David works in tetravolumes, a little known standard, wherein the unit sphere is rt2(2)*pi in volume.  That's (4/3)*pi*r**2 times S3, [the Synergetics Constant](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/64752).  Either way, [the ratios](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/08/tabor-walk.html) come out the same, so even in XYZ you will find the enneacontahedron comes within a fraction of a percent of a sphere's volume, hugging it even more closely than the rhombic triacontahedrons you may have encountered in [this neighborhood](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/01/storyboarding-lcds.html):  the 5 and the 5+.Below is a rendering developed [in POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) using the export feature from vZome.  I've jiggered with the camera and added a textured sphere inside, still growing to become tangent to the enneacontahedron's narrow diamonds, embedded in our rhombic triacontahedron's.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhCopJQr9SMcARYdb8gdCEfJ6_5aVwSA7BlSqVSPxC1C8eFbIhnRqOwW3BjLVoM-GyKU888lqgmEjzsFWcGuMoisvf7THWUwYxJH63gGbMISz-KhvgoCAPNBfy6629L9ASrXP9O/s1600/ennea.JPG)",
