I'm blogging in real time.  Good turnout.  [Milt](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/wanderers-2006830.html), [Rick](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/10/wanderers-20051018.html), [Allen](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/shanghai-city.html)... [Liz](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/wanderers-2007821.html).Mom is decrying luddite investment houses that still indulge in space-based pie in the sky weaponry projects, beltway fluff, a fad tracing to the neocon idiocrats behind all that New American Century [crapola](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=crapola).Now she's talking about the NSA's crazy-making [radomes](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/adventures-in-radio-land-part-2.html), buckyballs used as [ruggedized](http://www.phonescoop.com/glossary/term.php?fid=69) weather proofing for Jodie Foster type [dishes](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/day-at-vla.html).Kinetic kill weapons (\"Rods from God\") would be based in space, but maybe have no explosives.  They just drop stuff on people. Microwave guns might not be space based at all, but if controlled by satellite, they qualify as such. Plutonium triggers...Speaking of NSA, there's a guy here with that form of Buddhism that used to be known as [NSA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TreTAvzy7xY).  Apparently Linus Pauling did a book with their leader.Now she's showing [Addicted to War](http://www.amazon.com/Addicted-War-U-s-Cant-Militarism/dp/1904859011/), an hilarious underground comic book that weaponry teetotalers use, trying to wean those poor lost soul [LAWCAP types](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/synergeo-30350.html) from their nasty bad habits.Now she's going over the [Kwajelein](http://www.angelfire.com/hi2/kwa/) - [Vandenburg](http://www.vandenberg.af.mil/) - [Ft. Greely](http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/SEEJ/NMD/alaska/greely/) triangle.  \"Pretty tricky business\" she says (re the decoys).However, the Pentagon remains confidant, pending maybe Poland's acceptance, that this plan will pan out.Liz wondered how mom keeps from burning out, always working with dolts in Congress.  She's only 26, and has already about had it with those [numbskulls](http://www.answers.com/numbskull&r=67).  Mom shared about her many heroes, [Dennis Kucinich](http://www.dennis4president.com/) and such, still sources of hope.
