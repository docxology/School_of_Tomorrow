  "content": "This Irish / Celtic tale, beautifully rendered I thought, was in that same ballpark as my wife's Turning the Wheel and its storytelling.\u00a0 She went to Ireland with Elizabeth and Gayle to visit those kinds of places, imaginary yet real (Ireland is a real place but the proper noun is not a constant, as one might say Eire, as one might say Nippon for Japan).\n\nThe dad is sad, having lost his wife in childbirth, and she's got some problems probably stemming from lack of oxygen at birth.\u00a0 She's gifted though, and warms the arts of the frozen, which is are fate in Narnia as well, whenever [the Ice Queen](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-about-narnia.html) holds sway.\u00a0 This world has an old witch too.\u00a0 The echoes of Spirited Away were maybe not just in my head.\n\nThe big dog is adorable.\u00a0 The family dynamics are a great hook.\u00a0 I saw Step Brothers recently, a gift from Lindsey, a comedy with Will Farrell and John C. Reilly, of whom I became a fan through [Check It Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1657563/), and am in the mood to look at all that kid stuff again, not that it ever goes away or anything.\u00a0 I've always loved cartoons.\u00a0\n\nI wouldn't call this a comedy though, more an action adventure or, lets get real:\u00a0 a fairy tale.",
