When do we transition from prototypes to civilian product lines not subject to waterboarding by the mortgage industry?  That's what our Medal of Freedom guy was after.The idea of an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow ([EPCOT](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/epcot-makeover.html)) was a good one.

The taxpayers' channel?  Everything else is a rip-off maybe?Or let's just talk about money instead, how there isn't enough to go around (and never will be the way it's set up).Why focus on [engineering projects](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/09/omr.html) in the midst of a credit freeze? Why indeed.Are FEMA trailers really the best we might do?",
