I thought I was getting them from one David Chako (who favored \"tet-rays\") and I was happy to call them Chakovian Coordinates as a synonym, as that sounds like something Borges might uncover, in one of his scholarly detective-like deep-dives into glass bead game arcana.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nNot that Magister Ludi (Hesse) was by Borges, just they have much in common.\u00a0 Wikipedia traces the lineage yet further back, to other great minds, thinking alike.\n\nQuadrays may or may not come with an overlay wherein the tetrahedron they define has an unconventional -- from an XYZ standpoint -- unit volume. To have this feature is to sync the Quadrays home base tetrahedron with the IVM of Buckminster Fuller, or \"octet-truss\" to pick a patented architectural version thereof, or \"kite\" to go with A.G. Bell.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFour of them (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 0, 1) serve as basis rays to the four corners of a regular tetrahedron (of edges one?) from the origin at (0, 0, 0, 0).\n\nI use quadrays to develop a CCP (close cubic packing), as {2, 1, 1, 0}, meaning all 12 unique permutations of those quadray coordinates, point to the 12-around-1 ball centers surrounding a unit-radius ball center.\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwQTDk4ZIB76twiq9mo3r8XB59jdP7ekRvSXUp5DB-KLRLyH-kjqKsXvrq980TXL3aZPqe4uzAP1l8VlpyxOn32f2nAUi478cdoqXuiK-oVBZv2kYoIcdLzqRDdZD2CRhIAdsR/s400/Quadray.gif)",
