  "content": "I thought Stephen Colbert took some risks last night, jumping up and down, getting the energy going, then letting that slinky soap opera star, Judith Light, yak about est (Amazon too) rather openly, with Stephen saying he wanted to join a cult.\n\nThey agreed CBS is a cult already, plus est now lets you go to the bathroom (they did then too but no need to get technical [1]).\u00a0 Anyway it's [not called est](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/at-landmark-event.html) anymore. \n\nThey both talked about getting naked for the theater, not always the hardest thing.\n\nThe joke around here is \"What's more believable:\u00a0 60 Minutes about est, or Frontline on 911?\" Har har.\u00a0 [TV is just right](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/tv-ethnography.html) for \"true believer\" personalities, right?\u00a0 Talk about cult-like.\n\nBeekeeper Morgan Freeman, the first guest, is a producer director for the new Madam Secretary show, which draws inspiration from three recent figures of empire: Albright, Rice and Clinton.\n\nHowever it's a science fictional show (not a documentary) and won't lead Americans astray into understanding too much about actual foreign policy.\u00a0 For that you'd need [Covert Affairs](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/03/a-tale-of-two-movies.html), or [maybe Buffy](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-tv-talk.html).\n\n[1] your agreement was to sit \nin the back row if you were one of those \"bathroom at will\" people, \notherwise wait for the breaks like a normal person OK?\u00a0 Don't go \"excuse me excuse me\" climbing over knees, while someone is sharing their heart out. \n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/28746062375/in/album-72157665970258116/)",
