  "content": "Ever since [Pernilla Lind's talk at OSCON](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/07/oscon-xvi-wrap-up.html), the idea of graph databases has been rolling around in my brain.\u00a0 A kind of NoSQL.\u00a0 That's the place to fit in.\n\nI don't mind accepting the pejorative connotations of \"[spaghetti monster](http://androidarts.com/fsm/fsm_noodlings.jpg)\" (play up the Italian food angle) or the links to the spoof deity that said monster comes with, in the Atheists' religion (some denominations).\n\nThat's all a plus in my box.\n\nNeurons, like the Wild World Web (WWW), get messy, [like Ms. Frizzle taught](http://youtu.be/p8jw_-Vh9Z0).\u00a0 That's STEM.\u00a0 So yeah, a graph database might be a terrible tangle, a Gordian Knot.\n\nThe beauty of it though, may be seen in [its application to Quakerism](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9551327) and its processes.\u00a0 Nominating puts forward names in a slate, which gets approved by Business Meeting, thereby filling all these positions.\n\nWho served as what when, create a time slice, produce a resume:\u00a0 these things a graph database will do, and reliably, if you feed it true information.\n\nGIGO, right?\n\nJust keep track of who on what clearness committee recommended X for membership to Oversight, and you'll have your reports at the end of the day.\u00a0 Bring a smile to your clerking team's helpers, especially if your meeting has grown complicated and involuted over the years.\n\nMinutes are just log files detailing the transactions that have gone on. \n\nBut of course the applications of such graphing engines are far broader than Quaker committee work or household diagramming, business analysis and so on.\u00a0 The list goes on and on.",
