Mozilla) have already [been paid for](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/open-source-within-health-care.html) and contributed to the global ecosystem as shared assets, under the various open source license agreements.Relevant presentation:  [What is Open Source?](http://urnerk.webfactional.com/presentations/What%20Is%20Open%20Source.pdf) (PDF)[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEirE3M5u3QWWK9RofaCt3i4geQnAQWEBUO4g0KBcDpp7VA25WNMXQlkFbuPNDVwq0y5UA263brmfPYEv5vqmnwmqK0TTPoxarr0hyphenhyphenmRtMgSIxCDVarweKg1UMo5XVzZa3k9PXC7/s1600-h/kirby_playing_pool.jpg)",
