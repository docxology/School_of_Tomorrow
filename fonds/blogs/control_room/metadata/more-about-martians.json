  "content": "presentation at NIST \n\nI've been on a CC or two with Istvan as I recall, as I was in communication with [Ed Applewhite](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/necker-cube-guy.html) about the time he wrote [The Naming of Buckminsterfullerene](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/eja1.html) for Chemical Intelligencer, which Dr. Hargittai edited.\n\nI'm still taking this one in, about the Martians of Science, Istvan's name for his fellow Hungarians advising the Manhattan Project.\n\nMe on Facebook: \n\nI\n remember when Edward Teller spoke at Princeton. Students hissed a lot. \nThey do that at Princeton, like a viper pit or something, could be \nunsettling. They did the same thing with James Schlesinger as I recall, \nanother GST guy. No hissing at Isaac Asimov's packed talk as I recall, \nnor at Nader's (an alum).\n\n[General Systems Theory](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/general-systems-theory.html)\n\nCertainly economists compete with one another to become stars in their own field, but the discipline as a whole still\u2026\n\nGiven my interest in [Martian Math](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/12/more-core.html), with input from Applewhite, it makes sense that I'd be doing this homework.\n\nSpeaking of NIST, I've enjoyed a recent exchange with [Friend David Chandler](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/revisiting-911.html) on the awaited results of a next study (not by NIST, a peer review thing). NIST has findings of consequence for future building designers, given WTC7's structural failure from fires.\u00a0 I'm following from a distance.",
