  "content": "Hey, I'm pleased [the Idlib scenario](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/09/ironclad-logic.html) didn't go straight to blood, like some shoot out in Westworld, or should I call it the Park?\u00a0 Remember [Punishment Park](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/12/punishment-park-movie-review.html)?\u00a0 Now there was a dark movie.\n\nI have some Proseco to celebrate, no not especially Islamic of me, but many ethnicities stand to gain, if we're able to move the Global U towards a more constructive set of rivalries.\u00a0 Congratulations to everyone working on the rebuilding of Aleppo, especially that central mosque.\n\nI'm also celebrating the Fall Equinox.\u00a0 ISEPP hosted Wanderers at the Linus Pauling House.\u00a0 Terry explained his research into the history of the philosophy of engineering.\u00a0 He's on a first name basis with Sadi (Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot) and Lazare Carnot\u00a0 (Sadi's dad).\n\nThe latter was smeared in some circles because of his loyalty to French Republicanism.\u00a0 Nietzsche respected him for his sticking to his guns.\u00a0 Laplace was smeared too.\u00a0 This happens to intellectuals, as their power and influence, including postmortem (especially postmortem), gains them enemies.\n\nRussian and Turkish commanders are working on the Idlib scenario.\u00a0 Erdo\u011fan and Putin had hours and hours of meetings.\n\nSpeaking of Turks, I've been picking on the Gulenists a lot, expecting them to advertise a future-friendly STEM through the charter schools, in tandem with the Quakers.\n\nHowever that's putting a lot on their shoulders, given they're transplants in many cases.\n\nRaising the flag of some Verboten Math is just going to attract the spotlight, when they've already been the subject of any number of FBI investigations.\u00a0 Wading blindly into American politics is a recipe for getting in too deeply i.e. \"in over one's head\" as they say.\n\nI think I'll give those Sufis a break and switch my focus to the Jesuits for a change.\u00a0 That's another religious sect with a commitment to education.\n\nI've worked quite a bit around Catholic schools (and teaching hospitals) and don't doubt the high level of commitment.\u00a0 The decision to keep a tight lid on the Bucky stuff must trace to the highest levels.\u00a0 Surely pure inertia can't be the explanation.\n\nI've taken up the investigation (inquisition?) on Gab.ai for the time being.\n\nTerry has discovered some engineering literature we might have taken for granted would already be translated into English, but has not been.\n\nTake Coriolis  for example.\u00a0 We may have learned about the effect, but what do we know about the actual guy?\u00a0 A lot of his writings have never been published in English.\n\nI've never been put off by skin color, and mostly get along well with the dead.\u00a0 I'm not averse to learning more from the \"dead whites\" (and will soon enough be joining their number -- not to sound morbid or anything).\n\nA long time ago, scientists argued about [\"vis viva\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis_viva) or the motive force.\u00a0 They considered it a property internal to a moving body and akin to its inertia.\u00a0 How to account for it mathematically, in symbols and computations, was a question for that day. \n\nMass figures into the equations, most certainly, but then so does velocity, and perhaps to a second power?\u00a0 Is a projectile with twice the velocity thereby empowered to do four times the work?\n\nJean Bernoulli contributed some clever reasoning showing why E = mvv was more likely to get us somewhere, and indeed it did.\n\nNowadays we have E = mcc (Einstein), as well as E = hf (Planck).\u00a0 E is for Energy, v for velocity, m for mass, h for Planck's Constant and f is for frequency.",
