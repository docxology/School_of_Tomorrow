Space is \"Z-D\" (but what number is that?).\n\nThe conventional description of volume as \"3D\" relies on a \"jack\" of X, Y and Z axes, each one a next dimension.\u00a0 From this \"jack\" (vs. a \"caltrop\") we get 3-tuple addresses.\n\nA fourth orthogonal is problematic (in the sense of oxymoronic), however 4-tuples are not, and these n-tuple data structures may be \"projected\" to something visual in ordinary space.\u00a0 nD phase spaces have their Z-D analogs.\u00a0\n\nA ball of n spokes from the center, whether orthogonal or not, may be declared \"independent\" with sliders set each to a specific level.\u00a0 That's a \"point\" in an nD phase space.\u00a0 Tighten the rules a bit, and you get a manifold or metric.\n\nFuller's math is not investing in having any [\"hypercross\" of four orthogonals](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/hypercross.html).\u00a0 The tetrahedron pure and simple anchors our talk of 4D in this logical model, not in some sleight of hand or science fiction. One may use [4-tuple quadrays](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/09/compare-and-contrast.html) isomorphically with 3-tuple XYZ rays.\u00a0 The caltrop spans Z-space (Z + N = Tetrahedron).\n\nDeveloping an alternative 4D namespace is not to find fault with, nor invalidate, [anything by Coxeter](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/matrix.html), the grand master of multi-dimensional polytopes to whom Synergetics is admiringly dedicated ([with permission](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/quick-account.html)).\n\nFrequency (time/size involvement), added to angle (pure shape), gets us to five dimensions if we wish to avail of such tools, i.e. a tetrahedron persisting in time-size, the stuff of scenarios in \"Scenario Universe\" -- make sense?\n\nEnergy added to pure Platonic form (4D) is more the Synergetics template.\n\nWhen we have room for multiple namespaces, including exotic remote ones, such alternative beginnings get more room to breathe and show off their advantages, if any.\n\nSynergetics itself, once booted, helps us keep our minds open, to multiple namespaces.\u00a0 Systems, fully omni-triangulated, may be plentiful, like bubbles, produced quickly and in great numbers.\u00a0 Stay tuned.",
