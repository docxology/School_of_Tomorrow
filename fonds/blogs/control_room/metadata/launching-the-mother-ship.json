Mark Allen sat with us and shared about his adventures in clothes-making and, more recently, welding.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbkW9nFWVGjHqI3jLPK5cAWUWVagps9QMJpICpKJ-bje9FHz7uR2qL-fmWziNVco9YY6up0tHPczskEkyh0if18kaT5w5wV0L8m838zen7Fmtn6f_Wm_OLlEP-gTgMmEgKeBGQ/s1600-h/celebrate_remodel.jpg)weekly announcement bulletinJan 6, 2008",
