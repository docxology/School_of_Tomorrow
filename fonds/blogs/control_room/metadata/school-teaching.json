  "content": "I've been deeply involved in work-study, about 50% work, 50% study, which was my goal. The work that I do is teaching. I'm an andragogue (teach adults) by night, and a pedagogue (teach kids) by day.\n\nIt's the latter work I'm just starting, meaning I've still got a ways to go when it comes to mastering MIT Scratch and Codesters, even though I'm pretty well versed in pure Python (above average anyway).\n\nThe studying part is more eclectic and harder to describe. I think of myself as an anthropologist quite a bit. I'm an avid consumer of culture.\u00a0 Remember Bucky Fuller (whom I write about often in these journals) and [Marshall McLuhan](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/quotable-quotes.html) were [good buddies](https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/an-evening-of-marshall-mcluhan-bucky-fuller-in-rotterdam/).\u00a0\n\nThere's a Fuller title that's very like a McLuhan book, what is it again?
