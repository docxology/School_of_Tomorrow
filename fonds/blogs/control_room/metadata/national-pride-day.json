  "content": "A question is what we want from our nations. Job security? A marked grave? A criminal record? \u00a0As a first approximation, lets ask what we might get from somewhere else. In what aspects of life do nations have any competition?\n\nA religious order is the chief analog of the state it would seem, in having the power to assign rank to members, assign them tasks, insure their well-being in various dimensions, and mark their graves.\u00a0\n\nIf we claim Israel is an apartheid state, then is the Vatican any less so? It\u2019s walled-around after all.\u00a0\n\nOne question is whether rank has a basis in immutable physiognomic characteristics, such as skin color. Does an apartheid state have to be racist by definition? Might the barriers be entirely class based while blind to physiognomy?\n\nThe Vatican does not espouse dogmas regarding racially based ranking to my knowledge, but did it ever? I\u2019ve not done much digging into whether white supremacy, for example, found much foothold in the daily sermons and catechisms shared with noobs. I\u2019ll need to explore in the Museum of PR some more if I want to find out.\n\nWhat I do know something about (if not a lot) is how organized religion provided ammo for supremacists of various stripes.\n\nLets remember how \u201csupremacist\u201d is close to \u201cchauvinist\u201d in meaning, and to be \u201cchauvinist regarding X\u201d is to \u201ctake pride in one\u2019s Xness\u201d. However no transitive law insists on equivalence here. One may take pride in X without claiming X is best. X and Y might be equally good, but what\u2019s considered virtuous and natural is to be proud of what one is. Root for the home team: that\u2019s your job and your mission.\n\nWhich brings us back to nations, \u201cpatriotic\u201d being close to both \u201cchauvinistic\u201d and \u201cproud of\u201d. In Achieving Our Country, author Rorty takes \u201chating one\u2019s country\u201d as a kind of \u201cself hate\u201d which as such is pathological, where \u201cachieving our country\u201d might mean healing or overcoming this complex. \u00a0How might one \u201cfight for one\u2019s country\u201d without any sense of cognitive dissonance? \u00a0I\u2019ll get back to that.\n\nMy closing question for this entry (not really) is: what other institutions might we imagine that could provide us what nations provide, outside of organized religion? Consider the university for example. Imagine a global university consisting of a network of campuses, with students and faculty free to transit from campus to campus without bothering the nation-states i.e. these movements would not concern them.\n\nBefore you reflexively express skepticism regarding this alien idea, ask yourself whether every troop deployed by the Pentagon has a visa i.e. permission from the bureaucracy claiming jurisdiction over the territory. Do US troops in Guantanamo have \u201cred cards\u201d from the Cuban government, permitting open-ended stay on the island?\n\nLots of times, a corporation will ensure job security (a playable role) and creature comforts (including the necessary minimums: privacy, sanitation, opportunities to stay healthy, mentally and physically). Through your employment, you get a gym membership, health insurance (guaranteed access), a cubicle, pod, and dorm, cafeteria, meeting rooms, a travel budget. Do you need a state at all? How do rich people achieve statelessness to the point of paying zero taxes? Do corporations own graveyards? They certainly memorialize their dead.\n\nI was looking at the Las Vegas football stadium from the Goodyear blimp a couple nights ago, watching from an Asylum District sports bar, as the Oregon Ducks lost out to the Washington Huskies. That looks like a scale model of an Old Man River city (OMR) I was thinking. The new MSG Sphere aka \u201cEyeBall\u201d was visible in the distance as well.\n\nWhat if Boeing or the like could do an aerospace version for delivery on demand? A spanking new campus, with terraced apartments, transportation, and with rail to an airstrip. The stadium-shaped city would be big enough to host a stadium.\n\nWe don\u2019t build on that scale now, unless you count whole cities as singular projects, which we\u2019re free to. NYC is a campus, with ancient infrastructure. So is Portland. One of our main bridges is sitting on wood pylons in hard mud subject to liquefaction under earthquake conditions. We\u2019ll be closing that bridge and replacing those pylons with metal ones that go deep enough to hit bedrock.\n\nMight a city have \u201ca fuselage\u201d? Not in today\u2019s city planning yet and likely never. However I do expect more interpenetration of these shoptalks: \u00a0land-based construction and spacey-maritime.\u00a0\n\nShall we test one (an OMR) near Yakutsk? That\u2019s a big city in Siberia. I spent much of my morning on YouTube following travel vloggers to that area, just to remind myself of the challenges of permafrost.\n\nWhat would it take for a Stadium Campus City (SCC) or any city, to feed itself without over-plundering its surroundings, to the point of becoming untenable? I\u2019m not sure the Mayans ever mastered these equations.\u00a0\n\nA big part of the plan involves planning for recycling, of the skeleton itself, should the city become unneeded, or simply in need of a remodel.\n\nIn fighting for my country, I\u2019m somewhat careful with my \u201cwe\u201d. I\u2019m not too quick to ally myself with those having nuclear weapons for example, on the basis of shared citizenship alone. We the people of the United States do not necessarily own or claim to sponsor those nuclear inventories, and some of us fight to make sure we necessarily do not, unless in the capacity of safe disposers thereof, and recycling perhaps, but not in the form of WMDs. \u2018\n\nI\u2019m free, as a patriot, to explicitly disown properties I do not consider legitimately a part of my country\u2019s inventory. \u201cWho ordered these?\u201d Not us.\u00a0\n\nBut then others operate their virtual worlds differently, and maybe in their namespace, the USA is some last/only superpower. That position is then taken for granted by an ego (eggo) and becomes a symptom of what we call the \u201cmilitary-industrial complex\u201d a deep-seated psycho-pathology president Eisenhower warned us about. Fighting to restore sanity to these poor citizens is part of the good fight. Obviously, my country contains its share of drug addicts and crazies. I\u2019m proud of it anyway, the metaphysics.",
