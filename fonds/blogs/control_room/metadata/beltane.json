  "content": "[Wittgenstein](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/04/hb2u-lw.html) actually wrote about Beltane some. \u00a0Not everyone knows that.\n\nHe investigated disturbing aspects of the Highlander ritual, finding echoes of pointless cruelty. \n\nAn \"echo\" need not be interpreted as meaning \"from distant times\" ala Frazer.\u00a0 These associations have an immediacy in everyday grammar.\n\nSee Brian R. Clack's Wittgenstein, Frazer and Religion (Palgrave, 1999), 135-54, Chapter 8: Frazerian Reflections:\u00a0 Wittgenstein on Beltane and Human Sacrifice.\n\nUncle Bill Lightfoot came by for lunch at Bagdad. \u00a0I gave him the Bayard Rustin DVD, Brother Outsider.\n\nGood to see [UE](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/urban-edibles.html) starting up again (picture below). \n\nI've had an engagement with Multnomah Friends to present about AFSC as a part of the Quakers 101 workshop that's ongoing.\n\nI spoke about [Bayard Rustin](http://youtu.be/WdbQKjr9Bu4) and [Smedley Butler](http://www.quakerquaker.org/forum/topics/smedley-butler) as two pivotal Friends.\u00a0 The study of their lives will connect many dots, if you're looking to construct your own reality.\n\nThen a fire later. \u00a0It's Beltane, after all. \u00a0[HB2U Trevor](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/7134775167/in/photostream), good to share those cigars.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhjLW0eaKjZZXK6vUP2wjrHIWaA-J8dRU52u-8Rhi4sHf32VoUAXF8ZsQieSQ1Rn9ykTBUT3EhBfSvnw1261RWkGiUbvlJzxd68Exz0XRWQK5ykgMFiF8Cb5MDNCxFGjGVLu0_t/s1600/calagator.png)",
