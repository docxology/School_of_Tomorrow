Quakers helped pioneer a lot of the business practices we take for granted today and you'll find them still practiced in Quaker business meetings today.\u00a0 Agendas go out ahead of time, minutes are taken and taken up at next meeting, where amendments may be made.\u00a0 There's a constant effort towards leaving a clear written record of every meeting.\n\nHow do such practices carry into the future?\u00a0 To some extent the written word forms a happy medium, in that we're able to have our Skype sessions and hang out on Google, but not bother with a recording, as minute-taking is still the succinct brief we will take with us, along with augmented memories for ourselves.\n\nPractices need not change all that much, in other words.\u00a0 The need to have every meeting video recorded and archived is not usually felt to be pressing.\u00a0 On the other hand, living simply does have its advantages when everyone is potentially carrying a recording device and all phone conversations are retrievable.\u00a0 If you have too many non-matching stories or \"sets of books\" then the pressure to implode is somewhat exponential in the digital age.\n\nMy expectation is that people will keep the Quaker ways alive in a sandbox or virtual space (called \"religion\"), there to continue fine tuning a kind of utopian business community that self administers and self heals.\n\nSkills acquired practicing Quakerism will inform one's own private businesses thereby.\u00a0 For example today I plan to reach meeting in time to transact business [around coffee](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2013/10/october-club-feature.html).\u00a0 We have a supplier in Central America, as have we Friends.\u00a0 The global network keeps talking to itself, including to its Beanites (that's a pun on our propensity to consume coffee, and the name of [a founding family](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/09/quoting-from-facebook.html) in our branches).\n\nSpeaking of Quakers and caffeine, on learning of \"[Mormon Tea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedra)\" I was suggesting the Mormon authorities approach such a brand and allow its merchandizing.\u00a0 Typical of a Quaker to think in that way.\u00a0 Have little teabags and everything, some semi-fictive [Santa Claus background](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/before-prohibition.html) (not my place to make it up).",
