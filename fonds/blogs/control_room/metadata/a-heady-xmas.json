Edgar movie](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/j-edgar-movie-review.html) had that as a theme.\u00a0 He might have been involved in the Business Plot in some way.\n\nAt the cider place I used my Android to Google up images of Santa Claus owing to Coca-Cola's PR.\u00a0 That company did a lot to anchor Christmas in the sugar-filled world of North America.\u00a0 Sweets in winter make some sense when you're not just sitting around watching Netflix.\u00a0 From my email to Robert and Friends:\n\nPS: \u00a0I am personally not righteously bitter or angry about Xmas\ncelebrations and/or its commercialization, and as a former denizen of\nRome have a lot of appreciation for its imperial ways, which are not\nunlike those of today's liberals, eager to include everyone in one big\nhappy family (pax Romana and pax Americana aren't wholly unrelated\nconcepts).\n[http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/03/06/06_pax.html](http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/03/06/06_pax.html)\n(cited for the picture more than the text). \u00a0I don't give Catholics\nall the credit though. \u00a0Our modern Santa has everything to do with\nCoca-Cola company PR (ongoing, in theaters today). \u00a0This year we\nmostly did Hanukkah with friends (when presents happened), foregoing\nthe tree and presents on Dec 25. \u00a0I do like the manger scene because\nit celebrates non-humans (animals) in this space of innocence. \u00a0My\nritual around that was to let our dog freely roam around the lower\nfloor of the Quaker meetinghouse on Xmas, as Tara and I helped Food\nNot Bombs prepare for an Xmas day serving downtown. \u00a0Sarah is clean\nand has no fleas, thanks to vet visits. \u00a0I'm a \"Quaker animist\" in\nthat sense (I harbor a religious appreciation for nonhumans, including\nany ETs).\n[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/8310787551/in/photostream/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/8310787551/in/photostream/)\n\nOf course having Tara around is a chief joy of the season, Carol as well as she wouldn't usually be here this late into winter, right through to the next year.",
