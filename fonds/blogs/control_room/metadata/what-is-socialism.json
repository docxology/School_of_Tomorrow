My fancy Princeton education only served to sensitize my ear to the \"meaning as use\" paradigm, meaning I need to study a given language game rather extensively before I have a sense of its meanings, should I ever develop an ear for said language.\n\nAny randomly chosen pair of people, asked to talk about \"socialism\" will likely talk past one another, and neither may realize it.\n\nConsider a sibling question: what is capitalism? I have a wildly divergent meaning up my sleeve, a use in contrast with nationalism.\u00a0 Nationalists see the world in terms of various nations, vying for world domination.\u00a0 Capitalists see capitals instead, city-states, like Tokyo and Madrid.\u00a0 Capitalism is the world game of world capitals, some of them sister cities.\u00a0 No one but me has that meaning for that word.\n\nI'll define socialism like this:\u00a0 I work for the public half the year, and for myself the other half.\u00a0 People talk that way about taxes:\u00a0 given the government took X% of my total gross, I worked for the government Y% of the fiscal year.\u00a0 Fine, let's say it that way.\n\nWhat makes this system \"progressive\" is that we all chip in for the common good only 50% of the time.\u00a0 Whether you're a neurosurgeon or bartender or stand-up comic, you get half your life to do whatever you like whereas the rest of the time you're engaged in community service.\n\nNow I'll get theological on ya and suggest that God is a socialist.\u00a0 Ideally, you're acting in accordance with God's will half the time, whereas the other half you're given over to tempting alternatives, working in ways that might prove purely selfish, but from your point of view were worth a try.\n\nWorking for God feels a tad totalitarian, a little bit Big Brotherish. Subduing your own will to serve the all-powerful is like that.\u00a0 Exercising your own ego feels rebellious in contrast.\u00a0 You're going out on some limb, by choice.\u00a0 Half the time.\n\nStandard theology says God has forgiven us our Free Will in that without it, we couldn't choose to obey, so our coupling our will to God's would be an empty gesture. Thanks to our ability to stray from God's path, we partake of the divinity of Angels.\n\nThis must be a kind of Religious Socialism, not necessarily Christian but neither anti-Christian either.\u00a0 That's fortuitous as one way people like to attack socialism is by calling it godless, meaning they consider it to have no ethical compass.\u00a0 Somehow capitalism is supposed to have one.",
