  "content": "Welcome home to a dystopia we know well.\u00a0 Los Angeles is more a melting pot than ever, and there's an LAPD. However there's no real sign of national governments, only Sony, CocaCola, Peugeot and restricted air spaces. We're [in the mind of](https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/10/philip-k-dick-blade-runner/) Philip K. Dick, or some facsimile thereof.\n\nSony has been researching hologram technology for some time now, in addition to acquiring digital rights. Here we get Elvis as a ghost in a dead casino, and Sinatra under glass.\u00a0 The protagonist's girlfriend is a hologram.\u00a0 But then he's not all there either, a synthetic human.\n\nWhen we're able to simulate reality and use it to manipulate emotions, we tend to get lost in our own creations. Hollywood knows a lot about that.\u00a0 Are we real, or are we Memorex?\n\nThere's a problem with science fiction though, which is we're so used to screen magic that we're not able to tell if these holograms are any closer in everyday experience as commercial products.\n\nSome viewers may suspect Sony is sitting on some ability to generate building sized hologram ballerinas.\u00a0 Most won't.\u00a0 We've given up waiting for holograms at Best Buy much as we've given up on jet packs, as a part of that ever retreating mirage called the future.\u00a0 Flying cars, yeah right.\n\nThe replicants aren't sure what's a real memory and what got placed there by clever advertising. Did I really have that birthday, or did they just stick it in my brain TV?\n\nThe protagonist, bred to think clearly, to do detective work, as a better grasp on the unreality of it all than most.",
