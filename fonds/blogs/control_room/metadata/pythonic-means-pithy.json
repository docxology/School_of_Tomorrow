  "content": ":: [re \"pithy\"](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/polling-sources.html) ::Some of the etymologists among you may be by crying \"foul\", as \"pith\" and \"python\" stem from different roots.  However, pith relates to the spinal cord and backbone, and snakes are all about backbone, plus [Python's __rib__ syntax](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/pythonic-biology.html) provides ways for Python to stay pithy.  Not that far fetched.  Note also that \"pithy\" doesn't mean \"so dense as to be obfuscatory\" i.e. \"pythonic\" doesn't mean \"cryptic\".We're seeing [Athena's snake](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/airplane-reading.html) as the very same one [Apollo supposedly slew](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3660398658/sizes/o/) when taking Delphi from the Pythians.
