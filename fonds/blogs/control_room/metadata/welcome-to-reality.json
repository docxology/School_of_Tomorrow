Urner)Stephanie Cooper\u2019s Welcome to Reality, a play in nine scenes, is set in Lone Oak, a small New England town wherein all the adults have committed to a rationalist / literalist mode of thinking, with two exceptions: a science fiction writer who speaks of his characters as if they were real, and a civil war buff who believes he was once a rebel captain (sometime before the car accident).  \n These latter two have no problem relating to Hannah, an eight year old with an imaginary friend, Mr. Teddy the giraffe. \n\n But Hannah\u2019s mother and grandmother take the majority view that an imaginary friend is but a stepping stone to madness. Hannah should be focusing on learning to count past 29 (she has trouble with 30). They and other townspeople conspire to drum the two quirky eccentrics out of town, because of their supposedly subversive influence on the children.\n\n Ironically, many of these hyper-rationalist adults later prove defenseless against meme epidemics spreading through popular culture: Hannah\u2019s father gets sucked in by the Left Behind series, and dissolves his family in order to preach about the coming Rapture in Washington, DC, while Hannah\u2019s grandmother spends her life\u2019s savings on a \u201cDa Vinci tour\u201d in France, organized around Dan Brown\u2019s popular novel, The Da Vinci Code.\n\n I took Stephanie\u2019s theme to be the danger in not recognizing and nurturing the double-barrel nature of the human psyche. We\u2019re designed to think both logically and mythically.  Those who fail to responsibly mythologize as free-standing individuals tend to fall prey to mob mythologies created and propagated by others. \n\nTo stifle one\u2019s powers of imagination, so evident in childhood, is to risk lowering ones immunity against oft times predatory and/or opportunistic belief systems in later life.\n\nThe actors, a cast of sixteen, put a lot of time and talent into this one-time performance of Stephanie\u2019s senior project. Our venue: Ms. Brunel\u2019s drama classroom at Whittier High School, on the evening of February 17, 2006.",
