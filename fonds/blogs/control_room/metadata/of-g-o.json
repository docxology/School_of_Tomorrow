  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/36022710973/in/photolist-JoV1qn-WTcNXF)\n\nI recall a new relative, from South Africa, kind of squirming at TG a few years ago, when I brought up Die Antwoord, the music group.\u00a0 Although self cast as a duo, the Ninja guy and Yolandi, the group has lots of off screen talent, visiting dancers and the rest.\u00a0 The movie Chappie...\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI'm a fan.\u00a0 But in her circles, this showbiz act was an embarrassment, as maybe some UKers felt around The Beatles, at least originally, back in the day.\u00a0 This is what you admire in British culture?\u00a0 What about our Victorian tea cups?\n\nThat's an odd segue to G & O I suppose:\u00a0 Gurdjieff and Ouspensky.\u00a0 These were not heroes in my youth, as I'd barely heard of either.\u00a0 I followed Freud, Ernest Becker, Norman O. Brown, Wittgenstein... that's up through university, when I jumped into Erhard & Fuller, a dynamic duo back then (see the new bio).\u00a0 I've continued to add to my graph (tree) of course.\u00a0 We don't wanna be stuck in the 1980s.\n\nI'll admit I'm thinking politically in making Ouspensky a focus, in wanting to include some folks from St. Petersburg (I'm talking Eurasia, not Florida), Moscow and like that, in the foyer of fecund philosophers.\u00a0 Yes there's a \"self help\" angle to what they were doing.\u00a0 So what?\n\nWhereas psychoanalysts must needs be psychoanalyzed as a part of their training, we might be worried the philosophers have no therapy.\u00a0 Enter Wittgenstein, with his philosophy a therapy for specific metaphysical pathologies he knew only too well.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThere's no crime in philosophy wanting to have workshops or seminars, meetups with exercises (rituals) or whatever.\u00a0 The so-called church has no monopoly on soul searching and/or making.\n\nI have other ulterior motives however.\u00a0 Gurdjieff is someone Bucky jokingly found congenial, and a fellow alcohol user back then, or so Dr. Richard Buckminster Fuller seemed to suggest.\u00a0 He talked about the interminable toasts to the many types of idiot, with each a raised glass of something.\u00a0 Wine? Did the great master use colored water?\u00a0 Random Google:\u00a0 \"Although Gurdjieff did show some of the signs suggestive of alcoholism, such a daily drinking, drinking early in the day, and driving after drinking...\". OK, I get it, he liked to drink.\u00a0 Shades of Alan Watts.\n\nThat brings us to EST:\u00a0 The Steersmans' Handbook, a copy of which I've only recently (relatively) acquired and consumed.\u00a0 That's where Bucky is mentioned, and this was all pre Erhard Seminars Training.\u00a0 Then Bucky and est would cross paths (read the new bio for more of the story).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat's some pretty tight semantics, and summarizes our chapter:\u00a0 man the machine (\"man cannot do\"), man the Spaceship Earth program (woman the \"womb man\" -- if that's the etymology).\u00a0\n\n[ Using \"man\" or \"guy\" as a generic actually has a feminist dimension.\u00a0 The words no longer work to discriminate or distinguish.\u00a0 The default could just as well be female, in our 300 man brigade, task force or group. ]\n\nIs my point that \"overcomers\" (as in \"we shall overcome\") might be drinkers?\u00a0 More to the point is the similarity across these self help systems:\u00a0 how to address one's robotic behavior, complete with habits one sometimes feels at a loss to control.\u00a0 Some philosophers look down on philosophies with much of a psychological dimension, especially where self improvement is involved, and use lots of pejorative language (negative adverts, attack modes), versus jumping into the fray as honest competitors (self promoting, proving positive worth).\n\nIn other words, both Bucky and G&O accentuated the positive, and we see that in their respective trackers and backers quite a bit.\n\nI'll fade to Medium here, quoting one of my stories:\n\nEST\n = Electronic Social Transformation in some passages, although Stevens \nis clear about the Latin meaning as well, as in \u201cto be\u201d (also a part of \nErhard\u2019s spin).\n\nThe\n book is McLuhanesque in terms of attributing the great generational \ndivide to respective diets in terms of media, between the linear \nbook-reading Establishment of legislators, and the immersed \u201csimulsense\u201d\n TV generation he calls the Movement.\n\nWhat\n he calls Est people are the bridge types that still read and write in \nthe manner of the older civilization when needing to, but that \nexperience the new ultra high bandwidth of total immersion in an \nelectronic field of simulcast stimuli and programming, of which \ntelevision was only the beginning.\n\nBuckminster\n Fuller is a \u201csimulsense man in spite of his advanced years\u201d (page 34) \nand Bucky blurbs about the book excitedly on the front cover (see \npicture above):\n\nMagnificent\u2026\n an extraordinarily lucid and powerful book. It may well be the straw \nthat will save the camel\u2019s back, of Earthean crisis.\n\nFor me, this book helps bind Fuller to McLuhan again, an old nexus I\u2019ve talked about before,\n and paves the future for the \u201cchummy\u201d relationship achieved by Erhard \nand Bucky around the time I was leaving Princeton for Jersey City and my\n first job as a high school teacher at St. Dominic Academy.",
