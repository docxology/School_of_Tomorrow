I actually skipped eating as I'd just done that with Matt.\n\nI snagged Perez Zagorin's book Francis Bacon at Hawthorne Powell's this morning, while running errands in the neighborhood.\n\nI'm having a couple Irish coffees.\u00a0 Physicians have [a strong meaning for snakes](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/03/pi-day-2012.html), in bringing forward their caduceus.\u00a0 Most Irish I meet are jovial about St. Patrick's supposed feat.",
