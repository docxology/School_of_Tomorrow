What have I missed?\n\nMe:\n\n[I'm going around](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2019/06/sampling-facebook.html) saying Tulsi is indeed favored by the Kremlin so don't you\n believe those dino DNC types who still insist the Russians are Trump \nsupporters. The point of the Trump Tower meetup was to discuss Magnitsky\n Act, at which point WaPo / NYT immediately tune out, as the goal is to \nfocus on collusion against Hillary, not behind the scenes oligarch wars \nala Browder.\n\nAnyway, Tulsi is the obvious favorite on RT, and \nthere's no reason to hire troll farms to make that clear, not when you \nhave your very own CNN (i.e. propaganda machine). But unlike Matt \nTaibbi, I don't scream \"McCarthyism\" when NYT points out the Russians \nare backing a Hindu Hawaiian with no chance to win.\n\nFree Assange \nand Manning, support blockchain voting, legalize weed, stop regime \nchange wars, stop letting CIA run foreign policy (that's her \"stop \nfunding terrorists\" bill). Two times service in Iraq, active duty in \nHawaiian national guard. Proud of her Hawaiian heritage, like Obama.\n\nMy\n view is she's way too good to waste on a forlorn sorry office like the \nUS presidency (designed for sickos these days), but at least we can take\n away the DNC crutch, of making Trump out to be Putin's favorite. No \nway. And so why are we afraid of the Russians again, when they're \nclearly backing a candidate with no chance to win?",
