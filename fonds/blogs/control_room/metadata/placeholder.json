I'll leave a placeholder reminding me to do some more follow-up later.[I'm tracking Owens some](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2024/11/reflections-on-racism.html), and caught [this interview](https://youtu.be/GUZT69Co_LU), which harkens [back to Veil\u00a0days](https://flic.kr/p/2qyhxm4) and Bob Woodword and such topics, i.e. around the time I was starting to tune in DC, even living there off and on.I was playing offense on many levels and had [my own relationship](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/making-waves-in-dc.html) with DC comm circuits.\u00a0When I had that job with McGraw-Hill I'd continue with some of my earlier [Jersey City themes](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/10/all-thumbs.html).\u00a0I was back in the company of [Ray Simon](https://www.amazon.com/Mischief-Marketing-Successful-Careers-Businesses/dp/0809225905/ref=sr_1_1), after all. He later moved to Vegas. I ended up back in Portland.\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHz7usrErcHBdugqb4FaIgxbBIQGlHwdd2YUw1aargdwyDb-ySavOtiIzDURTuaaf9k-zdz1SA6ReTrjkx7W1sONyGWM22rRorXo820Ql0TU6htfyhisxB5REw0WsYI4cO9KdEk6xmNbKa7v3ErvaFTjGvfKdDzj1zPu3q9TJ1iKal3aIkvZun/s665/Screen%20Shot%202024-12-06%20at%209.07.11%20AM.png)\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhL1ybk_MwdFDcXuAU_-9NIOZ_9ePIM_gUPfrR-gf5oTs3GGsoeEcUQQHcNDKuH2g3mmOkLt-5Ls27Nmukuq1srPAQswMZx35fnZ9qjGlCwOjdqLiyN0uJrQNNpGpZMY8jQx4THn8adYbOqrNv1YtSZlHDKvggrusyrjCEfAQ7EMv8WiG6YVQON/s779/Screen%20Shot%202024-12-06%20at%209.06.48%20AM.png)",
