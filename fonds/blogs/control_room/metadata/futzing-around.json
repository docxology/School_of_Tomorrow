  "content": "I present this as a tribute to the MacBrook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009), on which I live install mplayer using Homebrew, and run a Python script to control it, all the while recording in Camtasia.\n\nThe work I'm doing is rather inconsequential we might say, but helps orient a School of Tomorrow student in the world of laptops, with their many surfaces (or \"windows\" as some call them).\n\nWhile mplayer compiles from source, I pip install the Python package [mplayer.py, ](https://github.com/baudm/mplayer.py)[Darwin M. Bautista's work](https://github.com/baudm/mplayer.py) (GPL) and tweek a script already tested on Windows.\u00a0 Here we're on OSX.\n\nAlthough it looks like the Calculator of Tomorrow (i.e. a laptop) is all about \"programming\" in the coding sense, this video goes out of its way to draw attention to the \"programming\" going on in the TV editing sense.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe contemporary desktop features talking heads, both synchronous and asynchronous, thanks to video and audio recording and playback capabilities, and public repos (repositories).",
