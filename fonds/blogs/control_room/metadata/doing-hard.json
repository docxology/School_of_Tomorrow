  "content": "\"Doing hard\" is in contrast to \"doing easy\", taking me back to [that funny movie](http://artsdispatch.blogspot.com/2011/04/gus-van-sant-and-william-s-burroughs.html) from Laughing Horse Books and Video, based on a short story by William Burroughs. I've asked David to come sit next to me in my office so we could surf the net and shop for the knives and case I managed to lose for him off the back of my bicycle.  I want him to come out ahead.\r We had way too much food, got started late, were lugging a piano (toy Casio), didn't get much help.  Thanks to Betsey Kenworthy for taking the compost.  She was there for the Nicaragua delegation meeting. Here's what I posted to the Riseup pdxfnb list:  Alas, one of my worst FnB days ever.\r I found David's chef knives (velcro roll) left behind at the\rmeetinghouse and stupidly put them on my bike rack, not well secured.\r They didn't make it to the park.\r I am committed to replacing every last one of them.\r If anyone sees a nifty knife set appearing on Craig's List -- I'll buy\rit back, oyster knives and all, no questions asked.\r Dropped somewhere between 43rd and Stark and SE Taylor and 34th....\r Also, I think starting our OTY pickup at 3 pm, when food prep starts\rat 3:30 is just nuts.\r We used to do our pickup at like 11:30 am.\r Toting a battery powered piano slows things down, need extra time for that too.\r Glad Elise came buy to give me a hug.  Tre was kind to me at the park.\r David is taking it well too, though clearly upset and disappointed.\rI'm really sorry guy.\r Kirby",
