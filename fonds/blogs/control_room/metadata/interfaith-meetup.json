He hung out with me 'n [Ed Applewhite](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html)\u00a0that time. \u00a0Ed was always gaga for architecture and Long was / is Frank Lloyd Wright trained (as in personally) and an expert in religious architecture in particular. \u00a0He and Ed had lots to talk about, though I don't mean to peg Ed as \"religious\" in that statement. \u00a0Ed loved being a skeptic about such things.\n\nHarold is Maureen's ex, for those who follow [my Russian novel](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/methodist-morning.html) (these blogs are full of comings and goings of the interesting people in my life). \u00a0Applewhite was a close friend and associate of Bucky Fuller's, another architect you may have heard of, [along with TC Howard](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/toward-history-of-domes.html) (Seattle Expo Bubblator, [Metallurgist Dome](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6834704198/in/set-72157629206299498/), many others). \u00a0Fuller and Sadao, their shop, was near to [Noguchi's place](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/musical-event-noguchi-museum.html) in Long Island City, just across from Manhattan. \u00a0Apologies for the deluge of trivia.\n\nAnyway, Lynne Taylor, a Wanderer, had organized an ambitious program, like a mini Parliament of World Religions but much shorter, just a half day. \u00a0Packed with content. \u00a0I have reams of thoughts. \u00a0I spent lots of time in the gift shop.\n[](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/10/carol-addresses-thirsters.html)\n[Carol](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/10/carol-addresses-thirsters.html), my mother, was representing Quakers. \u00a0She did a good job, making an abstruse historical allusion to Peter Waldo, one of the early heretics. \u00a0I could hear people thinking \"Who's Waldo?\". \u00a0The slide above and behind us (every religion had one) was of the Columbia Gorge I'm pretty sure, but mom wondered if it was Pendle Hill. \u00a0She talked about her deafness and loss of short term memory. She won the audience completely, good job mom. \u00a0I was in the pews snapping pictures.\n\nThen we adjourned to a downstairs panel discussion, after more snacks. \u00a0The event was gracefully tiered such that people could leave, but diehards could go for more, even ask hard questions. \u00a0As the chauffeur, I was of course on the hook for the whole thing, though did manage to spend a good thirty minutes arguing vociferously with another director type (think Wanderers) in the privacy of a large empty lot. \n\nThen it was back to fun and games. \u00a0We got to chant, sing, pray. \u00a0Many religions, Sikh, Navajo, Roman Catholic, Atheist, Scientologist, Essene, Baha'i, Jewish, Islam, Pagan, Hindu, and Quaker all up to bat. All comported themselves well. \u00a0The Scientology lady was into demurely celebrating her brand's being in the august company of world religions, already, and she shared a tasteful video (see below).\n\nThe Islamic woman was forceful during the panel discussion afterwards. \u00a0She was just back from Pakistan. \u00a0She's a business person, her own boss, and draws a line between Islam and the cultures in which it has so far been adopted. \u00a0She is very optimistic about [North American brands of Islam ](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/liberal-islam.html)because women start out with close to a full deck here, in contrast to other places. \u00a0Islam has a head start. Rarely has it been practiced in so pure a form. \u00a0She's on the highest committees in her congregation (sorry for mangling the terms). \u00a0There's nothing in pure Islam that dictates a Taliban interpretation of Islam, wherein women have few responsibilities.\n\nThe Atheist, who reminded me [of Duane Ray](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/01/wanderers-20100119.html), referred to himself as a secularist. \u00a0As I was explaining to the director on the cell phone, [to me](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/about-secularism.html)\u00a0\"secularist\" means \"believes in an equal opportunity to go to jail, no particular religious caste excepted\" (dividing \"church\" from \"state\" one might call it).\u00a0 I think of the late Reverend Moon (Unification Church) doing time for tax evasion.\u00a0 She may have had a different meaning.\u00a0 The Atheist quoted Carl Sagan from the pulpit, and cited Richard Dawkins as another hero, which I found almost too stereotypical, as if [South Park Studios](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/team-america-world-police-movie-review_04.html) had had a hand in this script (I admire [Carl](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/taking-inventory.html) by the way).\n\nDavid Tver was sitting next to me and asked for a definition of an Atheist. \u00a0\"Are Buddhists atheists?\" I asked myself. \u00a0My advice to Atheists is this: \u00a0it's dangerous to define yourself by what you're anti. My dad was an atheist one could say, but \"Quaker\" was a more positive identity, as it came complete with role model pacifists (like Bayard Rustin) and a kind of \"democracy in a box\" (our way of doing business). \u00a0What do Atheists so far have, in terms of community? \u00a0Walden Two? \u00a0Just a question. \u00a0No need to get defensive. \n\nActually the Humanists have a community, and a thriving one around Portland, so I think that's an answer right there. \u00a0The goal, in any practice, is to prevent arrested development, be that \"psychological\" or whatever. \u00a0Some atheists accept a \"psyche\" or \"ego\" (normal me) but not a \"soul\" (paranormal me, a non-existent ghost) -- nomenclature matters.\u00a0 An atheist might still embrace some form of depth psychology (e.g. Tantric Buddhism) to fight / counter / rebalance the various projected abnormal psychologies (some of them mob psychologies, collective).\u00a0 Aberrations stalk us all and you don't need to believe in ghosts to feel haunted by memories, as in PTSD.\n\nI'm the one at a disadvantage, I should just admit, in that I'm somewhat misanthropic and so outnumbered.\u00a0 As a little kid, I tended to favor non-humans over humans in some dialectic, like I more empathized with dogs and horses, or whatever. \n\nIn religion, such \"animism\" (I call it Quaker animism) maps to an esoteric form of gnosticism wherein you identify with the sneering angels, who think humanity was a mistake and are jealous of God's love for them. \u00a0You probably haven't heard of us if a mainstream Christian, but the angel fanatics are familiar with the literature, of angels as the humans' competitors (\"so how do you explain Guardian Angels?\"... obviously there was some kind of war, and the so-called \"good angels\" sided with Yahweh, obviously).\n\nAnyway, I wasn't doing the talking and got us home safely. \u00a0I uploaded a bunch of pictures (from the event, see above) then went over to Glenn's. \u00a0His brand of Neolithic Math re-galvanizes my vision of \"fat farms\" in the high desert, places to come to to shed metaphysical fat as well as adipose predisposing you to diabetes. \u00a0That doesn't have to mean vegan but for some it should. \u00a0You oughta try it religiously at some point in your life at least. \u00a0Experiment, don't get stuck in a rut and become a lifestyle bigot. \u00a0Your religion, Atheist or otherwise, is not your license to be a jerk.",
