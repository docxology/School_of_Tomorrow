  "content": "Probably a lot of kids are staying home from school, with parental permission, because said guardians are persuaded that Coding Train is providing a more personalized experience, in more useful skills, than the local commuter schools.\n\nThat sounds paradoxical because how would Youtubes over the wire be \"more personalized\"?  Well, it's not the student teacher interaction that's one-on-one, so much as the task at hand:  to customize the personal workspace.  Build your own file system.\n\nStudents herded from room to room, with or without a locker, don't get the same opportunity to outfit a workspace.\n\nThe homeschoolers are telling Dan to try pipenv instead of virtualenv.\u00a0 That's good feedback for me as well.\u00a0 [I'm one of the home schoolers](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/03/youtube-teachers.html).",
