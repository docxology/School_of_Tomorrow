Recent results have been disappointing from their point of view.\u00a0 A nuclear conflagration is harder to get started even if the UN Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty is just something on paper.\u00a0 So are a lot of things \"just paper\" (like money for example, other entitlements?).\n\nThis year, our memorial event (remembrance ceremony) featured a Buddhist invocation, several speeches, and a second indoor event in nearby NW 70 Couch Street.\u00a0 We were permitted to take pictures, and indeed spreading visualization memes was part of the intent.\n\nI fought rush hour coming home from the day job, where mom was waiting.\u00a0 My mistake to think the Hawthorne Bridge could be any better, now that Morrison is one way each way, but no way from the east side, short of joining I-5 somewhere north, which is crazy.\u00a0 But then traffic-wise Portland has succumbed to North America's chief ailment:\u00a0 addiction to one-driver commute lifestyles (leads to opium addiction, heart disease...).\n\nUsually, with no evening events pending, I don't have to fight rush hour.\u00a0 I know a friend with a swimming pool just off Boones Ferry, plus have Lake Oswego friends scattered around I can visit.\u00a0 The game around rush hour is to avoid it completely.\u00a0 Fortunately the day job starts around noon, and the drive is then typical, at posted speed limits.\n\nCross references:\n[2016: Hiroshima Day\u00a0](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/hiroshima-day-august-6.html)\n[2015: Disarm Day 2015](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/08/disarm-day-2015.html) \n[2013: A-Bomb Day](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/remembering.html) \n[2010: Hiroshima Day](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/08/hiroshima-day-2010.html)\n[2007: Remembering...\u00a0](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/remembering.html)",
