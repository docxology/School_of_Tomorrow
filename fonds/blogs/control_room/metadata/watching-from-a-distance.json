  "content": "I'm too busy prepping for class to really follow all the action, which is fast-paced.\n\nSo that wasn't nighttime footage, of the boat Trump phoned Fox about?\n\nOr was it that \nthe suspicious boat was rendering aid, in response to a distress call, by removing a \nmine put there by someone else?\u00a0\n\nClearly it was the right boat for the \njob (of mine removal, if that's what was happening).\u00a0\n\nMaybe they acted \nboldly (\"[bizarrely brazen](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28525/u-s-says-video-shows-iranians-forces-removing-dud-mine-from-damaged-tanker)\") because they imagined they were \npart of the rescue effort?\u00a0\n\nIf the mine is going to leave lots of \nevidence of itself anyway, then trying to grab it on camera is hardly a way to \n\"cover one's tracks\".\u00a0 That's just leading someone back from the scene of \"the crime\".\n\nDid the observers follow the suspicious boat?  Where did it go when it left?\u00a0 They know its name.\u00a0 They say it met up with a tug boat.\u00a0 And then?\u00a0\u00a0 That's one more boat in the story.\n\nSomeone on Facebook sent me [this timeline](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/28574/u-s-releases-new-evidence-of-irans-involvement-in-tanker-attacks).\u00a0 At least one version of events is starting to gel.\n\nRemoving a mine from a ship is\n in itself an act of bravery.  Coming back to retrieve a dud?  How does \nthe photographic evidence prove that theory?\u00a0 What ties the removal crew to the placement crew?",
