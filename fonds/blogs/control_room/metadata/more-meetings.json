  "content": "I was somewhat busier than usual today, what with the banking, the lunch at Portland Fish House, snapping a photo of Jennifer, diving into gnu math exercises and so forth, followed by a quick walk with Trevor over to Belmont and back, followed by a trip to the pet store to discuss Naga's care and feeding.\n\nTrevor and I talked submarines, including the [Japanese ones](http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=767) and the ones my uncle Bill Lightfoot writes about in his excellent [Beneath the Surface](http://www.amazon.com/Beneath-Surface-Submarines-Seattle-Vancouver/dp/1895590310/).\n\nOver lunch, Glenn and I discussed literature by R.D. McGown, which in turn references Bunce on music theory i.e. lots of Wanderer action, a lot of it in the [arts of memory](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Frances-Yates/dp/0226950018/) tradition.\n\nReturned to mom's cell's voicemail box my congrats on producing a successful [Chalmers Johnson](http://www.amazon.com/Sorrows-Empire-Militarism-Republic-American/dp/0805077979/) event, pre all this R&R in Washington, District of Columbia.\n\nNews on TV, local six but [on satellite](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/04/upgrades.html), spaghetti & tomato sauce (I rinse 'em too), some coffee, some staying up late to do laundry and blog.",
