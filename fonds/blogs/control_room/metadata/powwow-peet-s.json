Or are we talking the one that [BCCs](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/xtals101.html) with the squashed dodecahedron?Heck, even the cuboctahedron is a tetrakaideca, given the latter simply means 14 (perhaps your age even now?). Funny bumper sticker:  Heck is for people who don't believe in Gosh (OK, only kinda funny).See Synergeo 37796-97 for more on this tetrakaideca business (or go Google?).My thanks to Glenn Stockton for bringing a copy of [The Parsimonious Universe](http://www.amazon.com/Parsimonious-Universe-Shape-Natural-World/dp/0387979913/) to the table -- reminds me of my [Hargittai volume](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/geometry-in-nature.html) snapshot, also @ Peet's (Nick also present today, so some talk of [Stallings](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/12/another-day-in-rose-city.html)).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi0RKl4MRkbVplez3W2XIk5vrKjx-DMALI3DqgbYMB_IUSd-LSBYiNsM-wc7ZVAXt1FgSVCEAyaF_jBFzur_2skumqgkxry8y9kSabwQ24WyzWA-cA2wgUc9SQR04wu4qbyv1Ui/s1600-h/pauling_marsh.jpg)[source](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/38/2/112.pdf?ck=nck)",
