  "content": "As a high school debate coach, your plan might be to let your team lose a few times, as if you had a choice, as a way of getting them motivated but not demoralized. Any sport comes with reality checks. In competitive sports, such as high school debate, those checks may come in the form of the other team.\n\nThe American team has to be ready to take a pro-Russian view as the teams train to argue both sides in some kind of Lincoln-Douglas format. We\u2019re talking a private elite school with plenty of bandwidth. There\u2019s no requirement to fly to Russia or to have the Russians fly here.\n\nThe pro Russian position will likely be that Russia did not \u201cinvade Ukraine\u201d as Anglophones tend to put it, as the oblasts in question were asking directly to be rescued and amalgamated into the Russian Federation, ala Crimea. The lawyers were never able to reach an agreement on the legitimacy of these referenda, and subsequent ratification in the various chambers, and that started this war of narratives. The legal profession has a reputation for failure, although it\u2019s not as bad as the military profession\u2019s.\n\nThe Anglophones will likely stick to their characterization as one of invasion. The relevant data might include: to which side did civilians flee when evacuating their own farms? If the special military operation is actually an invasive onslaught, then Kiev will be able to document how civilians fled towards NATO (i.e. towards the west, geographically) whereas if the population drift were towards Russia (geographically to the east) then that\u2019s called \u201cvoting with one\u2019s feet\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m an older guy and not a debate coach myself. I\u2019d judge the debates as a random parent, which isn\u2019t to say we\u2019re completely ignorant of the art of rhetoric. The Roman heritage we get from being Anglophones includes recognizing many pitfalls and fallacies. Ad hominem arguments usually miss the point and so on. If all the pro Americans can come up with is \u201cPutin is a bad guy\u201d then their ship is likely sunk, in the eyes of the judges, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do better than that.\n\nI did find some debates in the archives, again among elite private schools if memory serves, regarding an earlier chapter, wherein the question was whether to link electrical grids. This is what we were up to discussing back in the Reagan Era, when the Cold War was thawing into a healthier time of warmer relations, featuring Apollo-Soyuz and so on.\u00a0\n\nThen came then unending failures of the State Department, with the successive appointments of deeply unqualified individuals. Obviously that\u2019s just my point of view. I never developed an ounce of respect for those jerks, starting with Secretary George Shultz, the Theranos guy (how I think of him). Madeline Albright was probably the worst.\n\nThe brief peace we started under Casey-Reagan, when the Ollie North types were on the run, was replaced by a long period of juvenile delinquency, culminating in the present class of deeply unqualified numbskulls with less than a high school level of education by today\u2019s standards.\n\nClearly I\u2019m somewhat biased in my outlook and would probably not make a good debate coach, given I just indulged in some ad hominem. The team should use me as a role model for how not to behave on stage.",
