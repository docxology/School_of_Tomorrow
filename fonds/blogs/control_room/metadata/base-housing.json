The guests don't own, and yet they share, the facilities. Ditto on a cruise ship. The opulence is a collective experience, as may be the experience of ownership, as a shareholder.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAll of which is to say:\u00a0 believing in institutional wealth is not \"anti capitalist\" nor \"anti socialist\".\u00a0 This relationship, of self to wealth, is as old as organized religion, with its shared houses of worship and ceremony, feasts.\u00a0 Hello, Father Divine.\n\nWhat \"institutional\" might mean, in the case of housing developments, is a certain amount of uniformity, even conformity.\u00a0 We saw that in the case of Levittown, Long Island, New York, widely recognized as the first modern American suburb.Every Apple Mac or Air of a certain era looks like every other.\u00a0 Models of cell phones look and work the same. Yet when it comes to architecture, we're often encouraged to express our individuality by commissioning a custom home.\u00a0 We're talking about the rich and privileged here.\u00a0 But might we be privileged without being rich?\n\n\"Rich enough to actually own\" is precisely where we don't have to go in the case of \"base\" and/or \"campus\" housing i.e. we might accept the privilege, yet without the curse and/or responsibility of private ownership.\u00a0 We don't need to design the cruise ship.\u00a0 That's for the cruise ship designers to undertake.\n\nThe book Quakernomics tends to idealize the notion of a \"company town\" (or \"corporate campus\") but only because that's what Quakers of the period were idealizing. The more prescient could see and almost taste a future in which those operating the facilities would not experience themselves as under the tyranny of some ruling class.\n\nToo good to be true?\u00a0 A lot of skeptics think so, and believe driverless cars or even \"real AI\" might be easier to achieve. \n\nAfter generations of mobile homes of various design, one might imagine the experimental encampments, the hexayurts or whatever, would not be too much of a stretch.\u00a0 Indeed, we've seen such encampments appear.\n\nBut just envisioning these mirages, as it were, does not replace the hard work of self governance or self management. \n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYzXYHD8RDIaP2YnhN2XQJwBL5HYznqb7tDWwNnaZATrwEfehFfAQ_7F2y0uTDOGcmN58Y-wLgGP2A04LHh-RYvp4SEPkLYUfbyOuZ5_H0LWJSelqx64BB8VHCGDVLfILX787bfjlmO0w9LSkvLSsMdAr8gxV4Cg1Bxxd46_6vP9VpYedHNA/s540/dome_village.jpg)",
