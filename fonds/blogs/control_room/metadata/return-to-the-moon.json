  "content": "Mom pointed out an interesting juxtaposition of stories on the front page of The Oregonian today:  the rural southeast feels bypassed by federal aid agencies; NASA wants to return to the moon.I have Google set to sweep newsmedia for any mention of the [OMR](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/09/omr.html) stadium-shaped city idea.  Turning stadiums into cities seems to be a favored solution to date, but that doesn't seem very practical in the long run.If NASA could build us a spanking new moon base (a dot-mil operation), maybe it could help us brainstorm about new high tech ecovillages right here on Spaceship Earth. We civilians (remember us?) could use some help from the aerospace sector.But NASA may not have the imagination for it, may not have the \"right stuff.\" OK, so how 'bout The Mouse in Orlando? EPCOT used to mean Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, before the language lawyers changed it to Epcot (deliberately meaningless) and disgused the [BuckyBall](http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&q=epcot+spaceship+earth&btnG=Search) with the wave of a magic wand (camouflage?).",
