  "content": "The talking animals in this namespace (\"Noah's Park\") seem remarkably incurious as to the origin of a buried treasure that comes to light.\n\nThe hypothesis it was placed there deliberately to inspire future experiments is one definitely worth exploring, but what else might it mean?\u00a0 Is it a relic of a past civilization?\n\nThat the wings could have metaphorical significance is not proposed, nor does anyone care to speculate as to how this statue actually did come to be in the pond.\u00a0 Is it some kind of trick, like a faux fossil in the mud?\n\nClearly none of the animals present have the skills to manufacture such trophies.\u00a0 If this really is the complete namespace, then divine origins are as good an explanation as any.\u00a0 We may accept \"God-given\" as axiomatic. Honk is right to seek its meaning.\n\nAt least the mysophobic camel takes this sign from God seriously, as some form of communication, and attempts to do God's will, by trial and error.\u00a0 As the dutiful empiricist, seeking his true niche (a cleaner place) he does his homework, practices science.\n\nYes, Honk the camel is the most faithful, the most loyal to God in the face of skeptics who have never felt the tug of the divine.\u00a0 Honk is perhaps the Moor, the Arab alchemist, the Kabbalah scholar who seeks to know God's secrets first hand.\n\nThe authority figure or imam, a frog-faced individual named Ponder, does not dispute the sign's divine origin, nor really offer much of an alternative interpretation.\u00a0 Yet he tut tuts the camel's empiricism, smug in his all-knowing attitude.\n\nThe frog recommends the camel keep the statue once the wings have symbolically broken off (a reminder of the dead-end nature of ego pride), but then seems uncertain as to whether he, a mere frog, has comprehended God's will himself.\u00a0 Any show of humility is more than welcome at this point.\n\nChildren exposed to this material will have an easier time ignoring loose ends, such as \"what did the sign from God really signify?\"\u00a0 Did it foretell that birds, another species, would one day collaborate to form an airline, creating friendly skies for this camel?\u00a0\u00a0 This would seem far fetched but in retrospect apparently it did.\n\nA hidden teaching was in due course revealed:\u00a0 go ahead and give up on dreams of greater powers obtained through your own efforts and loyalty to God, and instead let your friends help you compensate for your obvious weaknesses.\n\nYour approach to God will be indirect, mediated by others (the birds) whom God made to ply the sky.\u00a0 Be satisfied with your base nature (as a camel).\u00a0 Don't aspire to be in some way above your station or \"beyond your light\" (as Quakers might put it).\n\nDepend on your community to prop you up, in exchange for learning your lesson and in future adopting their same incurious / unquestioning attitude, and lack of aspiration.\u00a0 Learn to restate the obvious (\"camels don't fly\") over and over, as a kind of mantra, while avoiding all manner of speculative experimentation as empty vanity.\u00a0 Be a dolt.",
