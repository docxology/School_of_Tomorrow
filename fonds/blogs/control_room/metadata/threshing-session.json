I don't see Josh.\u00a0 I thought he might have a view on all this.\n\nMegge is opening the discussion on whether we agree that the topic is \"how best might Multnomah Meeting address Peace and Concerns issues?\"\n\nWe're back to the water / welling / bubbling metaphor which has been popular in meeting lately, one of our thematic memes.\u00a0 Catholics go through these.\u00a0 Seems the topic wording is more vague than what was put in the newsletter.\n\nSome Friends are too upset by the prospect of killing off Peace and Social Concerns (OK, icing it for a couple years); they want to thresh about their shock and worry about losing it, and maybe to share about their PTSD from being on the committee in the past.\u00a0 We have some PSC veterans here.\n\nVeterans:\u00a0 Joanne Luchini, Carol Urner, Jim Metcalf, Desiree Hellegers, Debbie Averill... so far everyone is speaking passionately about how a Peace and Social Concerns Committee is vital to Quakerism.\u00a0 Jan Kjerne remembers a time thirty years ago when the committee members all wanted to act solo and never attend meetings.\u00a0 That's probably the time this meeting seriously faltered before, in the 1980s.\n\nJim emphasized that such a committee is not about solving all the world's problems, but about supporting people doing serious work in the world as peace workers.\u00a0 The committee provides advice and coaching and is a repository for the meeting's organizational memory.\n\nStill an hour to go.\n\nCarl, clerk of Nominating, finally addressed the question as to why we're even having this discussion, as so far no one has backed Nominating's proposal.\u00a0 Mostly, it seemed to Nominating that Friends were not interested in serving on a reputedly \"falling apart\" committee. \n\nThe idea that people might come to Peace and Social Concerns meetings without going through an appointment process sounded like [a good way](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/innovations-in-role-playing.html) to address this apparent reticence on the part of potential committee members to come forward with concerns and leadings.\n\n\"There's still a Peace and Social Concerns Committee\" Carl claims.\u00a0 That sounds a tad euphemistic to my ears.\u00a0 He used the word \"goofy\".\u00a0 Mom said \"I don't think you're goofy Carl\".\u00a0 Carl:\u00a0 \"well, it may be that the proposal was.\"\n\nEddy is reviewing her career with the meeting, as several Friends have.\u00a0 We have only about nine minutes left.\u00a0 Glee is confused about how to separate her concerns into Oversight and/or Peace and Social Concerns.\u00a0 She's relatively new to Friends.\n\nI don't sense any interest in shelving the committee so far.\u00a0 My guess is the Meeting will move to resume operations as usual, with this vital organ intact.\u00a0 That doesn't settle [the issue of AFSC Liaison](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/06/notes-from-business-meeting.html) though, as I will likely discuss in [a future blog post](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/10/revised-org-chart.html).\u00a0 For today, that's a tiny footnote.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/afscportland/15333262530)",
