Take the following action:\u00a0\n\n1. Call all the Russians you know and leave a message: \"help us, we're turning into mindless idiots in the USSA!\"\u00a0\n\n2. Call the Russian ambassador and apologize for the knee-jerk sanctions applied because RT happens to be better than CNN.\u00a0\n\n3. Call your lawyer and tell her or him what you have done as an American Patriot. Sign the Patriots Roster for brave people only (you know who you are).\u00a0\n\n4. Cut and Paste this to all your friends, especially in Russia, let them know we need their help (\"was the USSR this bad?\")",
