  "content": "The scruffy hacker story, wherein Fancy Bear sparks indignation across the board, owing to connected Wikileaks revelations, meets expectations.\n[](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/feeling-bern.html)\n[Bernie](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/feeling-bern.html) is close to Commie himself right?\u00a0 So sure it makes sense these idealistic \"open sourcerers\" would be seeking revenge over how he was treated by Hilarious Hillary.\n\nLots of geriatrics have fallen for that phishing trick and easily empathize with [poor AOL users](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/10/email-woes.html) and so on.\u00a0 The white hat script kiddies are happy to explain how it all works, to their puzzled parents.\n\nThe other story is about the Internet of Things and how a bunch of wayward appliances all rose up in unison to attack Twitter, Netflix and Spotify.\n\nThis wasn't phishing, but something new.\u00a0 Actually denial of service using bots and zombie computers is not new at all, but we're to understand the scale and focus of the attack was record-setting.\n\nThe scruffy hackers, connected to [the Russians](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/10/email-woes.html) by as much slathered innuendo as possible (no wait, one of the long gone founders of the KGB had his name mistakenly not removed!) have the tamer old fart tech.\n\nFancy Bear is Russia, or at least a branch of the Russian government, \ntaking the gloves off,\u201d said one official in the Department of Defense. \n\u201cIt\u2019s unlike anything else we\u2019ve seen, and so we are struggling with \nwriting a new playbook to respond.\u201d The official would speak only on \ncondition of anonymity, as his office had been barred from discussing \nwith the press the US response to Fancy Bear\u2019s attacks. \u201cIf Fancy Bear \nwere a kid in the playground, it would be the kid stealing all the juice\n out of your lunch box and then drinking it in front of you, daring you \nto let him get away with it.\u00a0 [ [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/meet-fancy-bear-the-russian-group-hacking-the-us-election) ] \nIn contrast, the masterminds behind the toys, the attacking \"things,\" seem to be getting away with their nefarious antics scot-free, with almost no questions asked.\u00a0 \"Few leads\" says The Guardian.\n\nThe Russians seem to be manageable Bernie supporters, geeks in their basements with too much time on their hands.\u00a0 Their motives seem understandable.\n\nThe dot com attackers, on the other hand, seem to still have their off switch and an army not easily stopped.\u00a0 The corporate muggles are admitting their laziness.\u00a0 Yes, their \"things\" may be gamed.\u00a0 Don't forget to change your toaster's password.\n\n\"Nothing survives floods of this nature, existing or theoretical, \ncentralized or decentralized,\u201d Kaminsky said. \u201cIt all falls over. The \nhard questions here are about preventing this sort of exposure in the \nfirst place, and about improving our ability to respond and remediate \nwhen we do get it wrong.\u201d Prevention and remediation are the only \noptions in the kind of attack that paralyzed Dyn, Kaminsky said. [[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/25/ddos-cyber-attack-dyn-internet-of-things)]\nThis second, apparently not-Russian cabal, flipped their switch on and off a couple times, while engineers scrambled to \"mitigate\" the effects, however there's little evidence of real defenses or any actual mitigation.\u00a0 The attacks simply ceased, ready to begin again another day.\n\nSupposedly Homeland Security was looking into it.\u00a0 How about the FBI?\u00a0 In terms of how big a vulnerability was exposed, the scruffy Wikileaks phishing scandal doesn't hold a candle.\n\nDuping individuals is little league compared to bringing down a core name server.\n\nThe upshot is someone with an off switch for the Internet is newly enthroned as Voldemort, while the Russians get to play second fiddle as scruffy hacker idealists, more Snowden types, in league with Anonymous no doubt.\n\nThe implication in the case of Fancy Bear is youthful rebellion on display, whereas the other attack is both more ominous and more unconscious, more sleep-inducing, more forgettable.\u00a0 The corporate persons seem more eager to play dead, or at least roll over.\u00a0 The Russians seem less scary, less a giant to obey.\n\nWe're not really planning a lot of \"who did it\" stories in the latter case are we?\u00a0 It's more a tale of grin and bear it. You're at the mercy of Voldemort, and don't forget it \u2014 now forget it, until we remind you.\n\nOf course there's been some attempt to connect these two stories, I'm aware of that.\u00a0 Wikileaks is getting its revenge for some stale state trying too hard to be a hero.\u00a0 That connection is not widely alleged however, only whispered into the rumor mill (or maybe bull horned if from Alex Jones).\n\nAnother bed time story is \"911 was an inside job\" but there I'd have to say why tell it that way?\u00a0 A cabal of desperate outsiders, feeling powerless, thought this might be a way to seize control, and nothing panned out how it was supposed to.\u00a0 Whatever the point of the plot, it got lost.\u00a0 So much for \"insiders\" right?",
