  "content": "I'm finding [Law Enforcement Against Prohibition](http://www.leap.cc/cms/index.php) to be doing far more effective PR than NPYM Quakers in their [2008 minute](http://westernfriend.org/2008/08/npyms-minute-on-the-war-on-drugs/) on this topic.\n\nThe NPYM Quakers urge decriminalizing marijuana use but still want to prosecute growers and sellers.\n\nWe also call for decriminalization of drug use and possession, though not production or sale, in order to end the injustice...\nHow is that consistent (or just) I wonder?\n\nMJ should already be legally available by now, through any OLCC certified outlet.  [End Prohibition](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/cereal-box-rant.html).\n\nTreat minors differently sure (we already do), by teaching good health habits in school (anyone doing that, in [our Fast Food Nation?](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/07/make-them-fat.html)).\n\nIn general I'm concerned that Quakers have [dumbed themselves down](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/09/dissing-quakes.html) to become just another sect of bland Protestant (blech).  Lets hope they snap out of it.\n\nWe're suffering from a \"high geezer quotient\" in PNW Quaker circles.\n\nThe boomers have grown into 1950s style Good Doobies (aka [Squares](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/mining-cartoons.html)), a tiresome breed inheriting from those [teacuppy Victorians](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/cry-baby-movie-review.html).",
