Someone had the presence to interrupt proceedings and call me out on it, and I acknowledged up front I'd come late and was clueless.\n\nAnyway, I put the camera away and made my exit, using the same bus ticket.\n\nIndigenous migration flows of humans, somewhat mediated by weather patterns, have mixed with the waves of immigration to create a migrant farm worker ecology, with many social ills, hardly a utopia.\u00a0 Now a stronger sense of nationalism is encouraging all nations to wall themselves off.\n\nSome professors of nationalism may think going to wall systems is a return to normalcy, but they're thinking more of castle ramparts, Hadrian's wall at the most.\u00a0 We've never really tried fences.\u00a0 Human migration patterns have always been at odds with political storytellers, or at least often have been.\n\nThe commitment to wallify becomes a new test of humanity's patience for this latest invention of some 200 nation-states, many more if we count the virtual and not-UN recognized.\u00a0 The nation-state memeplex has been swept up by marketing, creating Rogue Nation this (beer brand) and Cyber Nation that (Cyberia).\n\nTwilight zone states, such as Palestine, Tibet, Kurdistan and maybe Cascadia, all cast long shadows in the quantum foam.\n\nAnyway, that Louisiana Purchase was really a good deal.\u00a0 President Jefferson was conflicted in how he might make the nation grow like magic, on paper.\u00a0 Where does the rubber meet the road?\u00a0 Creating more of the USA territory was akin to creating a national bank:\u00a0 smoke and mirrors.\n\nIn this case, a war in Europe led to bookkeepers [sliding Louisiana Territories](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/11/storybook-nation.html) from Spain to France, and France being really hard up for cash, given Napoleonic Wars (right?).\u00a0 Selling spoils of war with Spain to immediate cash advantage, in a war against the rest of Western Europe (including Russia), seemed a shrewd move at the time.\n\nWhy not sell all that land to the Americans?\u00a0 France would still get a piece of the action in New World business (as would Spain).\n\nHumans had learned to think globally and were divvying it mentally into what was theirs and their king's, with not much long term agreement, lots of bookkeeping, narrative accounts.\u00a0 The time zones had not been figured out yet, nor the grid of airports with three-letter codes.\u00a0 Latitude-longitude was getting a stronger grip, with the hexa-pentagon tilings of today (in computer games mostly) still esoteric.\n\nSpeaking of narrative accounts, I'm looking forward to [a lecture on Homer Davenport](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/12/toontown-revisited.html), an influential political cartoonist of his day, and horse raiser.\u00a0 His imported Arabians somehow account for Mr. Ed on television.\u00a0 Maybe I'll get that story straight this time.\n\nHow happy are humans about wallification and fencification?\u00a0 Travel and migration has always been about more than tourism.\u00a0 Getting away from weapons testers is another strong motivation.\u00a0 Drug wars crash lives.\u00a0 Slavers seem to capitalize on owning you in exchange for getting you through some gate.\n\nThe USA is caught in the middle of this questioning as West Region especially has been known for its wilderness and wildness.\u00a0 Walling in the nations will feel more like one global government than ever, but then where will all the rebels go?\n\nDictates of biology beget rebels, dissidents, divergents, geniuses and so on.\u00a0 The nations, with the cushion of virtual nations, need to not be too brittle, which sometimes happens when the logic gets overly calcified (as in skeletal).\u00a0 Credibility is strained.\u00a0 Look what happened to the Soviet Union.",
