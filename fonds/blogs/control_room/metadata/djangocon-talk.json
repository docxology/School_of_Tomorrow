  "content": "I'm in a talk being presented by a team from National Geographic.\u00a0 Justin Quick, Ben Fonarov and Farhan Syed are the speakers.\n\nDjango is a part of their website ecosystem.\u00a0 Their talk is based on their Django module [activitysteams](https://github.com/natgeo/activitystreams) on Github, the open source repository.\n\nAn Activity Stream is like a series of comments, likes, or game actions on a target.\n\nA semantics like \"You favorited a photo\" pertains, with an \"actor / verb / target\" grammar.\n\nWhat's exciting to me is the Neo4j graph database being used by the Horizon service.\n\nHorizon is their Node.js web socket service that takes snippets (like \"likes\") and stores them using Neo4j.\n\nI've been thinking of [a Quaker meeting management API](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/09/djangocon-2014.html) based on activity streams, not realizing what wheels might not need reinventing.\n\n\"Make [actor] [position] vis-a-vis [committee] for [term]\" would be the kind of semantics we need.\u00a0 Example:\u00a0 \"Make Joe Shmoe clerk of Oversight for three years starting June, 2015.\"\n\nAlso:\u00a0 \"Show [actor] and [actor] are married under the care of [meeting] as of [date].\" As I've pointed out on math-teach, said marriage might or might not be recognized by the state in which the meeting is situated (Quakers define marriage their own way, independently of their surroundings sometimes).\n\nThe team made the good point that browsers prefer interactivity to read-only web pages.\u00a0 Given how I generally have comments turned off in these blogs, I'm going against the grain on that score.\u00a0 These are on-line journals more than conventional blogs.\n\nHowever, it's fairly easy to post a link to a blog post and frame it for comments elsewhere, such as on Facebook.",
