  "content": "At our [School of Tomorrow](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/06/the-school-of-tomorrow.html), we use tomorrow's learning methods today.  One of those methods:  create a new Python3 Jupyter Notebook from scratch and start filling in (a) Markdown cells and (b) code cells about a topic you want to know more about.\n\nThe premise is, if you're learning Python, here's a excuse to practice.\u00a0 If you already know Python, might you still learn more matplotlib?\u00a0 I certainly fall into this category.\u00a0 I'm pretty deeply into Python, including metaclasses and asyncio, but the APIs for these data science objects are somewhat gargantuan, not to mention alien.\u00a0 However I wade in, armed with my Python knowledge.\n\nBeyond the nuts and bolts of data visualization, what do I really want to know about.\u00a0 In The School of Tomorrow, we focus on syntropic versus entropic processes.\u00a0 Syntropy is a local phenomenon, against a backdrop of Expanding Universe.\n\nWe might credit the sun for Planet Earth's yearly funding.\u00a0 Give us this year our yearly solar gradient.\u00a0 In this Youtube I look at making food last longer, even though it's in the process of decay.\u00a0 I also look at irradiation as fomenting decay versus postponing it.\u00a0 It's all about dose and effective dose (which we're at pains to distinguish).\n\nAgain, if you're a student with the school, think about creating that Github account or something similar and start getting those Jupyter Notebooks out there.\u00a0 Or just serve them locally on localhost.\u00a0 Either way, making them yourself is the process to engage in.\u00a0 Treat my example as a model to imitate and improve upon.",
