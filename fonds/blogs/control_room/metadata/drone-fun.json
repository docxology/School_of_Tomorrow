Mostly flat farmland is a perfect setting for drone training.\n\nGiven GST\u2019s immersion into Active Inference, I was quick to appreciate the \u201csensory input\u201d versus \u201caction output\u201d model, with a Markov blanket wrapping that me-ball self, controlling the aircraft. I brought that up with the Institute during the most recent Coda session, and sure enough, the \u201cdrone model\u201d as already well developed, in the Julia programming language.\n\nHowever Markov comes up in another way where drone action is concerned. Quadcopters easily take the place of \u201csea turtles\u201d in those \u201crandom walk\u201d demonstrations. When only the present position counts, in terms of imparting momentum going forward, then notions of randomness come into play, as what we have is always a probability distribution, perhaps sharp, perhaps diffuse. Markov chains enter the picture, along with some history of Russian greats.\n\nThose sea turtles, you may recall, all start at (0,0,0,0) but then each picks from twelve options, or thirteen if \u201cstaying put\u201d is an option. Role the dice. To each option, a permutation of {2, 1, 1, 0}, there corresponds a hop through space to a neighboring zonohedron, with twelve compartments or \u201cvoxels\u201d around each. Each hop is through a diamond faced center. We call them K-points, as they\u2019re where the closest packed spheres \u201ckiss\u201d.\n\nSo the goal here is to have the drones hover in such a matrix, with illumination patterns signifying the wandering sea turtles, four of which make a tetrahedron. Drones light up or go dark depending on whether the corresponding zonohedron, conceptual only, would be occupied. Variations on that theme. I\u2019ve cast the neutral buoyancy IVM nets in other action frames. In both cases we might take advantage of unique (a, b, c, d) whole number addressing for matrix positions.\n\nAn ideal gas may be modeled in a static moment as gas molecules in IVM positions, with random offsets, although you\u2019ll likely put science mag editors in an uncomfortable position if you do that; \u201cIVM\u201d (or \u201cisotropic vector matrix\u201d) is verboten terminology within the sphere of capitalist realism. Don\u2019t say \u201cA-\u201d or \u201cB-particle\u201d either, or risk accusations of promulgating \u201cthe BEAST\u201d (a specific geometric vocabulary, considered",
