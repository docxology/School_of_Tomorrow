  "content": "I rarely talk (or write) about my Uncle Earl.\u00a0 As is the case with Uncle Bill, I'm using ancestry shoptalk in a shorthand, as both uncles are actually siblings of grandparents, not parents.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEarl was the in-law of my grandma Margie's sis Betty. I recall the last name was Poole or Poolton, I'll ask Bill if he remembers, probably not.\u00a0 Carol might.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMy dad's side did not get to meet all of my mom's side, but isn't that usually the case?\u00a0 We meet the most of our respective clans at weddings and funerals, oft times.\n\nAnyway, I recall this conversation with Earl, who seemed enigmatic, yet good humored, happy to have time with me, asking why we say \"the campus\" instead of \"Campus\" or something like that.\u00a0 Why wasn't Campus a proper name?\u00a0 But for what?\n\nI have only this dreamy recollection, which includes the room.\u00a0 Then along comes this \"the universe\" versus \"Universe\" talk with respect to the Bucky stuff (R. Buckminster Fuller).\u00a0 These seem to be grammatical investigations.\n\nWhere I come out, almost as a sum of these data points, is with Global University in place of and/or as a synonym for Spaceship Earth.\u00a0 We say Earth as often as \"the earth\" it seems to me.\u00a0 So we might say Campus and mean Earth, as in \"the planet\" (the one we're on).\n\nCampus in Universe.\u00a0 Works for me, why not?\n\nI'm fine imputing a subjectivity to these terms, thinking of a passage in Synergetics wherein a Universe is like a complete game of how it might have turned out, something subjunctive flavored like that.\u00a0 There's a wistful \"could have been\" to one's own world (shades of Wittgenstein again).\n\nOn a rather different subject I'll chronicle here that I got up early and started taking in high volumes.\u00a0 The complete Silva Ultramind commercial, and then free episodes of the new Showtime documentary on Bill Cosby.\n\nAnd William James Sidis, the smart kid who just wanted to be left alone to think, therefore to be, not unlike Descartes, always pestered by his \"friends\".\u00a0 Later they found a manuscript he'd been thinking on (i.e. writing) and it seemed to be about thermodynamics in some way.\u00a0 They ran it by Bucky Fuller for his assessment.\u00a0 Small world.",
