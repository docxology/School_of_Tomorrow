My inbox is always humming with job offers, none of them usually at all a good fit.\u00a0 This one leapt out at me.\n\nAlthough I've read up on React (the client Facebook pioneered to make their complex update cycle work), the better to teach at O'Reilly (this was years ago), I don't promote myself as a Reactionary (joke, they don't call themselves that, I'm pretty sure).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe Angular people could call themselves Crooks (as in crooked).\u00a0 Angular meaning \"bent\".\n\nI'd say I submitted my resume as a sign of respect.\n\nAlthough the world domination fantasy is always inspiring, it's the kind of self discipline / self mastery it takes to get there that's appealing, whether one ever gets there or not.\u00a0 You get a great set of abs by trying (that's a metaphor).\u00a0 My belly shows off that other kind of six pack.\n\nLinux was the same way, the eternal underdog against the behemoths.\u00a0 That's somewhat of a romantic telling, as the giants got on board in the Giant Wars.\u00a0 IBM wanted its revenge against Microsoft, which had veered away from OS/2.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMore to the point, when you're a behemoth with expensive proprietary products (e.g. Tivoli), what you want most is for your clients to run a free open source operating system (low barrier to entry) with no vendor lock in.\u00a0 All the better to lock them in then.\n\nHowever Urbit doesn't need to dominate the world any time soon, in order to start making a positive difference in the world.\u00a0 The joy of Hoon + Nock is you get to think like a computer scientist.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou have a binary tree in your head as you code (\"the subject\") and your tiny set of nock codes go against it, computing the effects of your Hoon expressions.\u00a0 I've only climbed this steep learning curve for a week and already I feel smarter.\u00a0 Wing expressions.\u00a0 Runes (like bar-tiz or |=) for starting a generator of one arm, i.e. a gate i.e. a (battery payload) cell.\n\nThe effects get applied, in an atomic manner, and your whole machine is now updated, shades of Smalltalk, with its self-saving image.\n\nThe new media campaign is around the Crystal Ball Sequence, at OEIS, which links back to my websites. The idea is public schools with sufficient imagination to live up to our American heritage, will also share it (and by American, we're free to mean planetary, the same way we mean Chinese or Russian in the Global U). \n\nVirtual. USA OS.\n\nSome of the Urbit nouns seem to be German. \n\nI already feel somewhat on the hook to a queue of clients and don't think my resume will actually percolate to the top, what with 18 other applicants, especially sans a cover letter, but I'd clear the decks and dive deep into React should a tour of duty call.",
