Perpetuate slavery. Practice eugenics (war against the weak).\n\nWhether Michael's country will bounce back or not is one of the major soap opera concerns of our time, and if Wagner were alive he'd likely have given us some great Hollywood soundtracks about it.\n\nI'll settle for Weird Al.  Like John Oliver, he's wondering if this really could be hell that we've entered, have actually been in for quite awhile maybe.\n\n[Carol](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/10/mystics.html) has been especially eager to see this latest major box office Michael Moore flick.\u00a0 She watched it from the big chair, wrapped in a quilt, eating popcorn.",
