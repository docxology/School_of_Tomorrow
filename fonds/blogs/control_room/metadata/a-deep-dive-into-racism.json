  "content": "The Bellingham Museum of Civil Rights sets the stage for this scenario.\n\nMy usual banter about race is the annoying cleverism \"a racist is anyone who believes in races\".  That doesn't get me very far on some dates (just kidding).\n\nHowever in my two part lecture below, plus addendum, I go for some deeper history, and no, I don't mean [the story of Noah](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profiles/blogs/a-sermon-on-racism) again.\n\nWe've connected racism to some related concepts:  eugenics (considered as pseudo-science); and labeling more generally.  Edwin Black also wrote about the evolution of database technology in connection with denying people privileges.\n\nMy addendum gets into the specifics of the \"bridge\" we're using across the C.P. Snow chasm.\n\nI wrote a companion [Racism: A Study Guide](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/racism-a-study-guide-c3287e951f60), as a companion Medium story for these videos.",
