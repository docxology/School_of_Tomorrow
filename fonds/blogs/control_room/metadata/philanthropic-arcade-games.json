A percentage of winnings funneled through a \"public switchboard\" seems like even more direct control than we get over our taxes (like sales taxes), how they're spent by non-transparent legislatures (where are their billboard-sized displays?).Here you get to commit some casino profits yourself [through another colorful game](https://wanderers.pbwiki.com/CoffeeShopsNetwork) i.e. here's one more reason to stick around and play the slots, feeling good about yourself and your legacy (more salmon!). But that's just one application.  No one says your CP [Cafe Philanthropique] has to be anywhere near such a place, might be in Cape Town.",
