  "content": ":: future of the image ::Whereas Pycon was a boost, I'm still anxious about sluggards in academe needing it handed to 'em on a golden plate, whereas [the art colonies](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/storyboarding-tomorrow.html) have already come through, reproducing [the Fuller Syllabus](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3397588995/in/set-72157616066135225/) almost verbatim as both [museum quality](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3398325858/) and [shovel ready](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/shovel-ready.html).So [where's the buzz](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/serving-buzz.html), outside our little [OCN](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/) / [CSN](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/) \"meme machine\" I wonder?Last night I got an inkling:  a recognized art critique played off some French intellectual's [futuristic counterpoint](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3406658508/), invoking the [animist themes](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-quaker-animism.html) familiar in these writings, plus claiming a priority for [the graphical over the lexical](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/text-drives-graphics.html), while meanwhile cleverly obscuring their distinction.He knew this was [Obama country](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/ieee-presentation.html), so we experienced some shared mirth at the expense of certain neocon bloggists who've only just begun to discover how Shepard Fairey's work [plays off](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3405825225/) of Sino-Soviet socialist realism, [by going one better](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/05/other-russia.html).Those of us tracking [the Obey Giant campaign](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/on-mountain.html) all these years have no trouble understanding why such art would come in handy, come time to focus on something as real as the USA's presidential contest.  Speaking of which, I should have said \"gaggle of geese\" not \"[gander of geese](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/grunch.html)\" (thx to Haim, erstwhile [spar partner](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3406642044/), on Math Forum).[Dr. W.J.T Mitchell](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3406637586/) started as he ended, by invoking popular culture, Jurassic Park and The Matrix in particular (the latter presages the image \"going away\" leaving nothing but transparent data -- one of two ends in a spectrum, so then we steered in between).For those from the philosophy department (moi included), there was plenty of thinly veiled Platonism, tinged with Nietszsche's aphorisms (more a \"tuning fork\" than a \"hammer\" in this new twilight zone).I'm grateful to Glenn for getting me out of my cave and onto the Max down through Old Town.  We stumbled upon Phyllis Cole, my co-worker at CUE, friend and neighbor in Brooklyn (pre Richmond, where Dawn and I first started [this business](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/civil-unions.html) together).  Phyllis is [with Metro](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/11/town-meeting.html) now.  Cool.We went out to [Low Brow Lounge](http://www.yelp.com/biz/low-brow-lounge-portland) after the talk for a gear shift, noticed other art students doing the same.  Glenn and I both have art talks that'd fly with this crowd (Portland's young intelligentsia).  I could do one tomorrow if called upon, have a couple others already scheduled through spring.",
