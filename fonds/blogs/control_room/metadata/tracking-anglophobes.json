  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/5846000399/in/photolist-ZHXsVB-cYLStw-c5RPLS-9UAhfk)\n\nKind of [like Chuck Fager](https://afriendlyletter.com/lyndon-la-rouche-and-me-part-i/), prolific publisher of materials relating to our Sociedade Religiosa dos Amigos, I track the Lyndon LaRouche affiliated organizations (and anti ones too, some of them).\n\nTo be fair, I track the Nader founded Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs), such as [OSPIRG](https://ospirg.org/) (which I've supported).\u00a0 Nader is an alum of the same university.\u00a0 I've been at events with the guy.\n\nIn other words, I'm not saying I use \"track\" in a negative sense.\u00a0 It means \"pay attention to\" or \"is on my radar\".\u00a0 I admit to not tracking much more than I track, such is the finitude of one's radar. Omniscient are us, not.\n\nLyndon, of Quaker heritage (like US president Nixon), developed a sustained anti-British polemic centering around London's Venetian heritage, going back to Phoenicians (aka Puns).\u00a0 He distrusts their way of banking.\n\nErgo, when I'm wanting to tap into anti-Brit sentiment, a check in with LaRouchePAC.\u00a0 Indeed, they're out on the streets with signage, in some cases, telling some Youtube journalist with a camera what they're on about. \n\nAs is to be expected, they're all about Trump staying friendly with Putin, which on a personal level has not been a problem.\n\nThose who would appear to wish to throw [a monkey wrench](https://youtu.be/qbcTx4nBaio) into this relationship, get singled out for special invective.",
