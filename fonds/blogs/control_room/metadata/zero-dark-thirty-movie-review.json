  "content": "I thought I might miss this one but JS at the Meeting said it was good and not all that biased in his view.\u00a0 Not sure what to make of that, my curiosity piqued, I made time after a Hilton lunch at ApacheConNA, where Alexia and [Christine](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/03/argo-movie-review.html) and I joined up with director Holden.\u00a0 Christine had her own truck and took Alexia onward, while I ducked into the Regal in Fox Tower.\n\nKatherine Bigelow has already made a name for herself in the war movies department, [with Hurt Locker](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/11/hurt-locker-movie-review.html).\n\nEveryone gets what they want to some level.\u00a0 Letting the solo agent make the positive identification of UBL was a good touch.\u00a0 Did she have much choice in that being who he was at this point?\u00a0 The big plane seems a little hollow at the end, when the whole point of her career until now has been to reach this point, so now what?\u00a0 Make a movie about it?\n\nPakistan is properly alert to having some airspace invaded.\u00a0 Choppers always have problems so don't call me a spoiler.\u00a0 It's not like the U2.\u00a0 Remember the President Carter thing with the helicopters?\u00a0 The movie makes some literate allusions into the lore,\u00a0 [Charlie Wilson's War](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/charlie-wilsons-war-movie-review.html) isn't far in the background.\n\nHad UBL actually died years before, this would have been the better story then too, and there would not have been much to cross-check its authenticity.\u00a0 This movie is far from claiming to be an historical rendering of events.\n\nThat followup movie would talk more about who got what out of the deal.\u00a0 The CIA is portrayed as having been made to look bad after 911, when it falsely claimed WMDs were being stockpiled (remember that dog and pony show at the UN?\u00a0 They watch that in grad school now and learn that NATO intelligence was clearly inferior, jealous of UNSCOM and Scott Ritter).\n\nSo now it was all up to this [Lindsey Moran type](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/methodist-morning.html) to not be so wrong this time.\u00a0 She needed her loyal fans.\u00a0 The (movie) director counts on at least some being won over.\u00a0 She's the UBL hunter, straight from high school.\u00a0 Not necessarily a gun nut either.\n\nSpeaking of the director, the actor, Gandolfini (Tony Soprano), looked [not unlike Panetta](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/wading-around.html) as CIA director I thought, if maybe rounder.\u00a0 The NSA had a role too, as a skeptic and reality check.\u00a0 We were back to the embassies and [Fortress America](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/team-america-world-police-movie-review_04.html) (I remember those under-car mirrors).\u00a0 Not too hard to understand.\u00a0 The US president was close at hand, was the feeling (as thoughtful, analytical).\u00a0 The narrative looks for its boosters within White House circles.\n\nMaya is not totally unsympathetic (more would say the exact opposite) in that she does net better treatment for the first torture victim, who starts getting some decent treatment eventually, though not Hilton quality certainly.\u00a0 Being truly amicable goes a long way.\u00a0 Not that we see much of that in this film.\u00a0 USAers are an unfriendly bunch for the most part, as cast, eager to detain you or at least snatch your cell phone at gun point (not shown).\n\nAlthough persistent, Maya is not expected to have paranormal abilities (Casey was known to look for ESP on one's resume), there's no remote viewing except what comes in from satellites, nor does she need to speak or read other languages.\u00a0 She has to go through translators and her collection of torture CDs would need to be dubbed.\u00a0 She's an attainable role model maybe.\u00a0 There's no assumption she's expected to bed-bounce her way to the top either.\u00a0 She's more like a good Muslim in that way.\n\nThe birthday cake plot element again seemed to echo back to Iran and Ollie North during Reagan's term.\u00a0 They (he and McFarlane) were hoping to butter up some arms trader in that storyline.\u00a0 Or was it Ayatollah Khomeini himself they were hoping to charm?\u00a0 I'm Googling old articles as [I think back](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/on-job.html) to [those days](http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/53099/eliot-a-cohen/a-spy-for-all-seasons-my-life-in-the-cia).\u00a0 There's a sense of betrayal.\u00a0 Iran is a still a \"bad guy\" in Washington's simple \"friend or foe\" neural logic (simpler than Drosophila's probably).\n\nI should see that other new spy movie about that op (rescuing hostages), which I remember learning about closer to the time in early public accounts.\n\nAnyway, the movie hopes we're at least friendly enough to buy some of these images of who and what Americans are supposed to be.\u00a0 There's this hunt for UBL.\u00a0 Now it's over.\u00a0 They shoot a lot of parents coldly, telling the children it's OK.\u00a0 The Pakistanis aren't so sure this is acceptable.\u00a0 They're told to stay back.\n\n[US military helicopters](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-love-song-of-rbf-movie-review.html) have become a cliche and/or trope, thanks to Vietnam War movies.\u00a0 This film takes the challenge of the chopper sound to heart and explores \"stealth chopper\".\u00a0 Can a helicopter be made quieter than a dog barking?\u00a0 The soundtrack poses that as a kind of physics question, testing our willingness to suspend disbelief (another variable, a wild card).\n\nI know many of the events mentioned were real enough.\u00a0 Nancy Irving herself told me what it was like [at Friends House](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/london-knowledge-lab.html), after that bus explosion in London.\n\n[Tony Soprano](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/09/my-character.html) is perceptive, noticing the ISI is close to UBL's secret hangout. There's a negotiated flavor to this settlement.\u00a0 Something for everyone.\u00a0 Washington DC continues to play some imperial headquarters full of bossy types.\u00a0 The film suggests [spunky women](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-affairs-afghanistan.html) (who know when to cuss correctly) have a bright future at Langley, [token blacks](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/11/spook-who-sat-by-door-movie-review.html) too, and OK to be Muslim (Wolf a nice touch).\n\nI returned to ApacheCon in time for the whiskey social.\u00a0 A lot of the guests are from other time zones and some are furiously working on their talks.\u00a0 I empathize. \u00a0We later joined Ashley at Rock Bottom. \u00a0Both her parents were or are in the military. \u00a0Mom is a medic.",
