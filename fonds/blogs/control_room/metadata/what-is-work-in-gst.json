  "content": "I was blessed with a visit from Sam Lanahan today.\u00a0 He was fresh from a concrete convention, which had worn him out.\n\nTurns out Flextegrity has applications as a replacement for rebar.\u00a0 Asian markets may understand it best, given they're in surge mode while a wartime economy (what the US enjoys) of necessity involves throttling back (applying the brakes, in other words). By Flextegrity I mean to include C6XTY. See the newest version of Sam's book.\n\nMostly I'm cramming on statistics, going back to high school days and relearning about how sample variance and population variance each need their own formula.\u00a0 I'm moving into linear equations territory (y = wx + b and back propagation by means of gradient descent i.e. multi-variable calculus and machine learning) not because I expect to become a data scientist, but because I'm a Python instructor.\u00a0 Like a piano teacher, these are the pieces I'm expected to play and relay.\n\nRemember, statistical (stochastic) algorithms were developed in the social sciences and ported over to thermodynamics.\u00a0 If \"entropy\" still has the flavor of \"political chaos\" there may be reasons why.\u00a0 Sometimes \"entropy\" is a positive, as in cryptography, as true randomness proves problematic in a deterministic universe.\u00a0 A legitimate source of chaos proves a godsend.\u00a0 By God's grace alone are we liberated from our own robot-hood.\u00a0 Automaticity rules, a sin which can and will be used against us.\n\nThe many jargons (shop talks) bleed in both directions across their bordering membrane barriers, I can hear Peter Sloterdijk intoning, in native German.\n\nFor example: energy the way the physicists mean it, as work, has to mean something in terms of economics (having a job, or jobs) as well.\u00a0 Take the Latin word \"tractatus\", a root for \"traction\" \"tractor\" and even \"tract\" as in \"opera\" or \"opus\" i.e. a dramatic \"work\" (Gilbert & Sullivan).\n\nPeople work hard to star in soap operas (an expression of their wish to remain clean?).\u00a0 The meaning of \"work\" is not a constant, in that \"joules and calories\" vie with \"dollars and yen\" to express work's value.\u00a0 \"To keep up this rate of energy expenditure (horse power), I'll need to be fed\" -- that's just physics.\u00a0 Capitalism fantasizes not being responsible for human welfare thanks to robots.\u00a0 But what can robots really do?\u00a0 That's an ongoing exploration.\n\nAs general systems theory (GST) authors (Kenneth Boulding etc.) would sometimes talk about:\u00a0 current and currency have much in common, in terms of the cyber metaphors applied.\u00a0 Both dollars and electrons \"flow\" and without a steady flow of dollars (US, Canadian...), or other denomination, the \"machinery\" grinds to a standstill.\u00a0 Cash liquidity is like oil:\u00a0 grease the wheels.\u00a0 We have our ways of repaying favors.\n\nA big problem (challenge) around World Game is ivory tower types devise the ground rules and spin out these board games, theoretically playable. However, given still emerging facts about human psychology, animal psychology, physics, other sciences, it turns out these games aren't always that playable as envisioned.\u00a0\u00a0 The ivory tower, full of know-it-alls, turns out to be not so all-knowing after all, an old story.\n\nIn practice, the rules need to be tweaked, if not overhauled, and pretty soon we're in some unknown territory where in people draw upon their own moral compasses regarding what's ethical.\u00a0 They're disobedient.\n\nThis state of affairs is associated with higher entropy and \"[corruption](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/05/wanderers-2010511.html)\".\n\nPeople are not following the edicts properly.\u00a0 They're in violation.\u00a0 A scandal.\u00a0 History then turns into a procession of scandals, as the game architects continue to spin out one unplayable game after another.",
