  "content": ":: Clocktet ::This was one of my first ever Internet collaborations, back when the Web was still pretty new.  Richard Hawkins had a high end (for the day) SGI computer graphics workstation, and could pump out these amazing geometric cartoons, an original inspiration for [my hypertoon concept](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/new-toyz.html), which he encouraged me to write-up for a contest SGI was holding (I might have won a machine like his).Anyway, I'd write these little \"screenplays\" about scenarios I'd like to see, and he stitched them together, added his own, picked the perfect sound track and voila:  ClockTet.  I remember showing this as the \"cartoon feature\" in San Diego's Balboa Park during the [1995 Fuller Centennial](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/geni1.html).  People packed into that little theater to see movies about Bucky, and I did [a live show with this ClockTet](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/geni3.html) on VHS tape, just to warm up the audience.Just to explain something:  the title derives from the fact that 3 o'clock is a 90 degree angle on a standard dial clock, which 2 o'clock is 60 degrees.  From the former we develop the cube, from the latter a tetrahedron, then we show all these relationships characteristic of Fuller's approach to geospatial literacy, involving the Jitterbug, [duo-tet cube](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/volumes.html) and so on.Richard went on to make many more mathcasts of this kind, focusing on A & B module dissections especially, but not exclusively.  Many of these were warehoused at [the New Civilizations web site](http://www.newciv.org/Synergetic_Geometry/).",
