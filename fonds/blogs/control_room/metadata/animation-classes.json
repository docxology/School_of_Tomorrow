  "content": "The curated clips of high schoolers walking out in protest, in the Michael Moore film [reviewed below](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/10/fahrenheit-119-movie-review.html), gets me thinking more about possible high schooler lifestyles.\u00a0 I'm thinking beyond such questions as to whether to arm the teachers.\u00a0 I look at the role of firearms in other writings.\n\nLifestyle and curriculum content are not wholly separate, by any means.\u00a0 Suppose you learn at home three days a week, visiting community school buildings less hours.\u00a0 Does this make you a \"home schooler\"?\n\nMaybe some of your time is [in a studio](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=10168568) for making videos, doing [cooking shows](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/community-kitchen.html).\u00a0 Video editing, camera work, health and nutrition, kitchen procedures (recipes and algorithms), all mixed together.\u00a0 Store the videos to the school server.\n\nNot every video has to go to Youtube.\n\nI'm picking up two animations classes this week, 2D and 3D, in two different schools.\u00a0 We think in terms of age levels and running in parallel to existing curricula.\u00a0 The early grades seem to be plane geometry intensive whereas later we go spatial?\u00a0 That's a rough approximation.\n\nIn 1997 I attended the ISEPP-organized [Math Summit at OSU](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/mathsummit.html).\u00a0 There, I heard a talk by Dr. Keith Devlin encouraging more connections [between movie-making and calculus](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/10/tweening.html).\u00a0 A tiny delta t is like a frame of film, encapsulating some action.\u00a0 Literally, action per time frame, in mechanics, is mvd/t, which is energy units (E).\u00a0 But then how fast is the film playing?\u00a0 Enter E per t, or Power.\n\nIntegration means accumulating small differences as governed by the changing variable, the dx or dt. I think of how [Fibonacci numbers](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2018-October/012024.html) are accumulative.\u00a0 What [continuous curve](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FibonacciPolynomial.html) fits those, I forget?",
