The narrower framed pair were advertised with the slogan \"[they'll think you know everything](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3223282683/)\" -- more consistent with the professorial look, courtesy of Mens Warehouse.I realize the haircut (by [Bishops on Hawthorne](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/blind-spots.html) (\"obey!\")) is [not regulation](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/05/gates_defends_soldiers_pink_un.html), however we \"long hairs\" get special privileges, so we'll mix more unobtrusively with our peers, i.e. the more \"ordinary\" ([less nutty](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/saying-cheese.html)) professors.",
