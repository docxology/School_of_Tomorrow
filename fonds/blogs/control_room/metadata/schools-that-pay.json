Coss\u00e9 .  However, the FSF has not seen fit to give its endorsement.\u00a0 They may have a problem with Github.\n\nSo I've exchanged more than 50 emails with the FSF over the past year, imploring them to help make this project better, or publicly endorse it, or something.\u00a0 Anything.\u00a0 After all, a solid 50% of my goal with the project has been to make FS4E development appealing and viable by creating incentive.\u00a0 (FS4E = Free Software For Education).\u00a0 Last month Richard Stallman told me that FSF could support the project IF we found an alternative to the Raspberry Pi and didn't use Debian.\u00a0 Uhh.\u00a0 Of course that side of the project is not the part that encourages FS4E, exactly, so that feels like overstepping their position just a little.\u00a0 However, why not keep trying? I asked myself, and so I offered to oblige them on those points as best I could.\u00a0 Yesterday I got a new transmission from FSF and it turns out that the promotional video I put up last month cannot be on YouTube in order for FSF to support the project.\u00a0 But that's not all!\u00a0 They also object to having the project on GitHub!\u00a0 They advised me to fix all these things and then get back to them and \"convince them to support the project\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI believe this puts the project back on \"hold\" until further notice.\u00a0\u00a0\nNetDispenser is not exactly the same model as described above.  It's about students earning more discretionary time on the internet in exchange for passing various tests, running various obstacle courses, designed to be fun and educational by game developers.\n\nThe router actually restricts access to only a few websites once the student's account has been depleted.
