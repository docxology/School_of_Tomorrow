Abuse by adults is rampant.\u00a0 Not a pretty picture.\n\nSo even if the Pizzagate conspiracy is a lot of thin ice, tough to defend in the full light of day, it's a hot topic of conversation among the abused and semi-defenseless.\n\nSo why squelch it?\u00a0 Why bully the kids into silence about topics that obviously concern them (e.g. pizza)? Vector the energy in a positive direction why not?\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/31403272246/in/dateposted-public/)",
