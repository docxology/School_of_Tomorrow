  "content": "Like the Madagascar series, with which this series has much in common, the characters are still evolving and branching out, with movies of their own.\u00a0 Madagascar spawned [the Penguins thereof](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/12/penguins-of-madagascar-movie-review.html), and the two Despicable Me films, which I saw out of order, have set the stage for Minions, not out yet as of this posting.\n\nA similar plot element pops up frequently in movies these days, given our fear about \"franken-food\", GMOs etc.\u00a0 The baddies are into genetic modification or transmogrification or monsterfication (monsterization) -- but then is that really a new activity?\u00a0 No.\u00a0 The evil genius has always been into making monsters, only reality has changed.\n\nGru is an interesting character, compared by some to Boris of [Boris & Natasha](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/quiet-first-day.html) from Rocky & Bullwinkle days.\u00a0 He's extremely flamboyant in ways completely inconsistent with the usual idea of a \"spy\":\u00a0 someone living \"under cover\".\u00a0 He has many good qualities.\u00a0 A lot of the best humor, though, comes through his minions.",
