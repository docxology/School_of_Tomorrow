  "content": "Great voyeur camera, inviting us to judge, then challenging our judgments.\u00a0 I stuck around for the comments track, or at least some of it. \n\nThe two best parts, dialog-wise:\u00a0 the riff on the impending Apocalypse, to the security guard; and the encounter with the two Scots, maybe brother and sister?\u00a0 [Language barriers](https://youtu.be/IdRHaDi2E9c) among Anglophones.\n\nBoth skits were hilarious.\n\nApparently the director has evolved a technique for \nworking with actors, based on lots of improv and rehearsal, that keeps them in the dark about the big picture, \nhelping them stay innocent of the corrupting omniscience of filmic consciousness.\n\nThe film is billed as a comedy, but then isn't Kill Bill likewise over the top?\u00a0 Gothic funny.\u00a0 Like [Psychoville](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305562).\n\nI got a strong Eleanor Rigby vibe, watching all these lonely people, their comings and goings.\u00a0 The anti-hero is definitely a wanderer, and very British (like Eleanor).\n\nAs observer, I got into like an [R. D. Lang mode](http://www.psychologistanywhereanytime.com/famous_psychologist_and_psychologists/psychologist_famous_r_d_lang.htm).\u00a0 He was the psychologist who moved in with his patients, the better to \"get crazy\" from the inside.\n\nLang was a boyhood hero of mine, back when I imagined growing up to become a psy something-or-other.\n\nRated NC-17 or thereabouts, for nudity and language.\u00a0 Not a recent film.\n\nPicked at random, because Movie Madness gives me the freedom to do so.",
