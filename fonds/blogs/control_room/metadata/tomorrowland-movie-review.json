  "content": "There's precedent in these blogs for me breaking a review into two or having another review come to me later, more analysis or whatever, and that's the approach I wanna take here.\n\nWillamette Week, a witty paper, had me all prepared to not like this, for the right reasons, but I ended up admiring it a lot, for all the archetypes and love knots it takes on.\n\nRemember I go by Chief Marketing Officer for some Coffee Shops Network that has Athena very much in its heraldry, and this film has an Athena.\u00a0 The dad-daughter relationship there is encoded in Greek mythology as well:\u00a0 she sprang from his head directly.\u00a0 There's some Gnostic potential there.\n\nSo yeah, lots to think about and really well made.\u00a0 Good work.\u00a0 I will follow up at a later date with more thoughts.\u00a0 Hey, I'm still thinking about Mad Max.\u00a0 These movies are like time release pills.\u00a0 They're not over when they're over, if you're like me.\n\nAlexia, sorry if we'd planned to see this together, I was just pretty sure it was a dud going in and my evening was geared to Starlight Parade.\u00a0 You and I would have others to choose from.\u00a0 As it happens, not a dud in my case, and I missed the parade this year, hope to catch it next time.",
