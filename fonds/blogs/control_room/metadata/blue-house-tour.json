  "content": "Lets focus on the office spaces in this one.\u00a0 I'm not showing the Raspberry Pi 3 workstation in the basement because it's accessed through the local network.\u00a0 No one needs to go down there to see its screen, which I may just unplug and use elsewhere.\u00a0 Or not.\u00a0 It's usable as a temporary office as is.\n\nThe Winter Office might sound like it's for winter use, and that would make sense, but I'm thinking it more as the cold office that has links to the outside world.\u00a0 It's under the upper deck we restored.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30939261943/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nBecause the Winter Office may run at freezing temperatures, I keep it behind a closed door, running a space heater to heat the Downstairs Office (there's a whole-house furnace but in this day and age I consider running that an unnecessary luxury).\n\nA fish tank right outside has only a small heating device, so I abet that with warmer ambient air, though on a fluctuating schedule.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30907265034/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nFinally, the Upstairs Office: also with a cold blooded creature, the pet snake.\u00a0 This is where I do a lot of my work.\n\nI'm able to sleep there on a futon if I need to, turning my bedroom into more of a guestroom if that's desirable.\u00a0 I've had a few guests, from Brazil and [Indonesia](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/08/basement-revolutionary.html).\u00a0 The upstairs has its own restroom.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/31711486906/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nUnder the guest room (the Downstairs Office also doubles as a guest room), I have a large workspace equipped to share media.\u00a0 People come over to watch DVDs sometimes.\n\nWhen the temperature is suitable, I may quit my office and work there instead.\n\nWhen others come over to work on projects, a question is whether they need a computer.\u00a0 In that case, the Winter Office might be a best bet, as it has a guest account already set up.\n\nMostly I'm just supplying fast Wifi, including 5G in the Upstairs and Winter Offices.\u00a0 We share a smaller bandwidth channel elsewhere.\u00a0 People bring their own devices (BYOD), like at a coffee shop.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/31376209920/in/dateposted-public/)",
