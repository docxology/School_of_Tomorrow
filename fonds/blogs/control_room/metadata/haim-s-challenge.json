  "content": "In chapters passed, I tried to dispute Haim's Challenge, which he [re-introduced on math-teach](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=10152455) again recently:\n\nThank you for the opportunity to re-introduce \"Haim's Challenge\",\n[http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6300122&tstart=0](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6300122&tstart=0)\n\"There are no important open questions in math pedagogy.\"\n\n(The\n Challenge is to prove the premise wrong by pointing to even one \nlong-term, ongoing examination of open questions in math pedagogy, by \nany group of people, anywhere.  The context is K-12 mathematics.)\nI'd bring up A&B modules, T&E modules, clearly referencing Synergetics for its pedagogical implications.\u00a0 Of course the K-12 curriculum should be adjusted, here and there!\n\nOf course I do not discuss math pedagogy, for the simple reason that there is nothing to discuss.  Or, so I believe.\n\nI believe:\n(1) We know everything there is to know about school mathematics (i.e., K-12 math), and\n(2) We know everything there is to know about how to teach it.\n\nSo,\n the only really important question is why don't the schools do what we \nknow they should do to most effectively teach math to the most students?\n\nThe\n answer can only be found by exploring the politics of education, not \nthe mechanics of long division or anything like that.  We know the \nmechanics of long division.  What is less clear is why the schools don't\n teach it well, if at all.\n\nI realize now that actions speak louder than words, and [Haim well explains](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/12/seeking-work.html) many phenomena I observe in the ambient culture.\n\nWhether I agree with Haim's challenge (more like a claim) or not is immaterial.\u00a0 My sphere of influence is definitely limited.\n\nPeople treat mathematics as a static aspect of their environment.\n\nHell would freeze over before \"tetravolumes\" would rise to the level of attracting the attention of grade school math teachers, let alone prove share-worthy, with coming generations. \n\nI get it.\u00a0 That's certainly not a decision I'm comfortable with, which accounts for my somewhat non-mainstream ethnicity.",
