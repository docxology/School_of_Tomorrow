Buckminster Fuller, the dome guy. [@BuckyFullerInst](https://twitter.com/BuckyFullerInst) [#4D](https://twitter.com/hashtag/4D?src=hash)\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [October 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/784047974938611712)\n\nUVT means you get a conceptual kit of spatial shapes with nice whole number volumes. Kepler's fave, rhombic dodeca, has volume 6. Wow, easy.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [October 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/784047614807318529)\n\nEven a relatively shallow understanding of US history requires studying the Cold War, the DEW line radomes, the hippie Whole Earth movement.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [October 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/784046423805272064)\n\nHey kids, not your fault if Pearson censors UVT (unit volume tetrahedron) from your high school math textbooks.

That might be it.  Check your math textbooks.  UVT?  Even just in a sidebar?\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [October 6, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/784045761352699904)",
