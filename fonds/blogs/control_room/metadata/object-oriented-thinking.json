  "content": "I was hanging with Deke (@dekebridges of Twitterverse) the other day.\u00a0 You don't get 50K followers or whatever it is by being a bot.\u00a0 Deke is a Penrosian Node in a non-computable space, a neural net given over to meme filtering, amplification, and propagation.\u00a0 He's an instrument of the Zeitgeist.\n\nI'll call him Lawn Mower Man for short (just kidding, insider allusion).\n\nThe thing about Deke is he likes Wendy's and one in particular.\u00a0 He's brand loyal, to this instance (the special case), and to the class or template, the species.\u00a0 This is Python talk, the computer language, just like Java jive at this level (Smalltalk, C# or whatever).\n\nThere's the pie-in-the-sky Platonic Wendy's in a Platonic strip mall (which need have nothing to do with stripping or strip bars, no need for see-no-evil monkeys to avert their eyes), and then there's the actual brick and mortar on-the-ground site-specific Wendy's, which typifies the ideal in an actual instance.\n\nIt's a Wendy's with a self, to continue the Python talk.\u00a0 And it's not just a mindless affiliation in Deke's case.\u00a0 He sincerely likes the chili f'rinstance.\n\nAnyway, as we were driving around he suggested we might stop at Wendy's.\u00a0 I said \"I'm a Taoist, I don't fight the Way, when with Deke, go to Wendy's\" and we did. \n\nDeke just called.\u00a0 Gotta go.",
