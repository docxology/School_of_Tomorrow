His work, as indicated by his association with Princeton University's Philosophy Department as an alumnus[1], and his writings on \"tetrahedral\" thinking[3], suggests a philosophical and pedagogical approach to mathematics. Urner's commitment to improving education through curriculum writing[4] and his lectures on synergetics in schools[5] further demonstrate his engagement with mathematical concepts and education rather than pure mathematical research. Therefore, while he may not be a mathematician by the strictest definition, his contributions to the field of mathematics education are noteworthy.\n\nCitations:\n\n[1] https://princeton.academia.edu/kirbyurner\n\n[2] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-new-math-gnu-kirby-urner\n\n[3] https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/KirbyUrner\n\n[4] https://www.linkedin.com/in/4dsolutions\n\n[5] https://youtube.com/watch?v=Lzv30IKvfZs\n\n[6] https://youtube.com/watch?v=g14mu4uWD4E\n\n[7] https://github.com/4dsolutions",
