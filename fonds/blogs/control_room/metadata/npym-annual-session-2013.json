\n\nWhy?\n\nOne actually strengthens and develops as a result, and so prospers psychologically.\u00a0 Doing the work that needs doing, if one can swing such a thing, tends to be satisfying, even when there's too much to be done and one is always facing inadequacy.\u00a0 There's team work, there's relationship, and there's a shared sense of purpose.\n\nSo lets not talk of \"great sacrifice\" in the sense of giving up high living standards.\u00a0 You may not be as physically consuming, but for a lot of us that's healthier anyway.\u00a0 Malnourishment is a much a matter of consuming too much as too little.\u00a0 \"Affluenza\" they call it.\n\nI've mostly been hanging out with the old timers, like Sonya Pinney, whom I've known all my life.\u00a0 Her kids are my age, and their kids are going to college (as is mine).\u00a0 Gail Sanford.\u00a0 Barb Janoe.\u00a0 We sat outside during dinner, comparing notes.\n\nAlthough I tell people I'm on retreat, I'm actually working full time, not having gotten off teaching.\u00a0 Given my students are online, all I need is a not-too-choppy Internet connection.\n\nSpeaking of which, my 4dsolutions.net disappeared for awhile when Webfaction moved it and set the wrong DNS numbers.\u00a0 I contacted them from my single dorm room in Clark and they realized their mistake.\u00a0 I'm about to re-up with the registrar as well and momentarily wondered if the DNS issue was related to that (a company called Jumpline, Inc. is registrar for 4dsolutions.net).\n\nCarol has been working hard with her doctor and Apria to make sure she can get some portable oxygen equipment in early August.\u00a0 I helped her fill out and return a PDF on-line, harder than it sounds once you factor in all the settings Windows has regarding Wifi authentication.\n\nTara is maybe doing a few things for The Open Bastion.\u00a0 Her summer has included working with them, Patrick in particular.\u00a0 TOB produces Djangocon and Apachecon among others.\n\nSometimes I look up from my Python and post something math related.\u00a0 Tonight that was [to edu-sig](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2013-July/010862.html), but earlier today, [to math-teach](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2581851).\u00a0 Will my postings get through though.\u00a0 I invest considerable time in those and yet sometimes they don't make it through the moderators.\u00a0 Sometimes I park them elsewhere then.",
