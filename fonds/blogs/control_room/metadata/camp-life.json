These numbers are not precise, nor are the definitions (what's a city if not a more permanent kind of camp?).\n\nAfter an increase of five million last year, the number of people displaced by conflict \u2013 refugees, asylum seekers or those displaced internally \u2013 was at an estimated 65.3 million by the end of 2015.\u00a0\n\nIt is the equivalent of one in every 113 people on the planet, according to the UN Refugee Agency, and if considered a nation would make up the 21st largest in the world.
