Subsequent\nprobe indices are computed as explained earlier.\n\nAll arithmetic on hash should ignore overflow.\n\nThe details in this version are due to Tim Peters, building on many past\ncontributions by Reimer Behrends, Jyrki Alakuijala, Vladimir Marangozov and\nChristian Tismer. \n\nHaving a link directly to Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming in the comments for the Python dict object grounds a specific source code implementation in the computer science behind it.\u00a0 Great for digital mathematics teachers in need of heuristics.\n\nI have that Knuth volume upstairs.  What a great way to learn.  Plus I have the Python REPL (pronounced \"reh-pull\") open in another window.\n\nIn going over the set data structure and its operations, I was thinking back to New Math and elementary school, when set notation was making its early entry into kid consciousness.\u00a0 This was unfamiliar material to most teachers and much of it was junked in the ensuing backlash.\u00a0 But we had no REPL back then (a few lucky college kids [had ISETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SETL) maybe?), what if we'd had one?\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/22085060961/in/dateposted-public/)\n\n:: a duck is not a mammal! ::\n\nBut in 2015, why not boot a Python interpreter at some point when typing has been mastered?\u00a0 Learn about union, complement, difference, intersection all over again.\u00a0 It's just like New Math, but with more machinery to back it up.\u00a0 I call it [Gnu Math](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/search?q=gnu+math).\n\nSpeaking of typing, [my friend Glenn](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/07/about-factory.html) reminded me why he can't type effectively, even after a lifetime as a typist:\u00a0 most keyboards don't allow resting fingers on keys whereas in his time with NSA he had to pound through ten-ply fan-fold.\u00a0\u00a0 When he tries to type on a keyboard, he floods his own text with errors.\u00a0 So frustrating!\n\nMaybe there's some steampunk solution where an old mechanical Royal typewrite type keyboard is wired up as a USB peripheral?\u00a0 My retired college [professor friend Chuck Bolton](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/09/some-family-history.html) never seemed to master the new keyboard either.\u00a0 The Royal sits proudly in the living room.\n\nIn sharing Python with art history students or journalists, what's more important than exhaustive practice or keyboarding is an appreciation for the layers of culture, the ecosystem.\u00a0 How does C source code relate to Python and what's a hash table?\u00a0 That's enough of a story for one article.\n\nWhy I'm addressing art historians these days has to do with the '4D meme' in the art world since the late 1800s, the core topic of another book I sometimes [reread and review](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/10/art-history.html):\u00a0 Linda Dalrymple Henderson's The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean Geometry in Modern Art.\n\nThrough Python, I introduce art history students to the topic of Quadrays or Q-rays, needing no more than some high school XYZ mathematics, thereby helping to anchor the '4D' meme as Fuller used it. I also introduce [Q-rays](http://www.4dsolutions.net/satacad/martianmath/mm17.html) in [Martian Math](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/10/so-you-wanna-be-martian-math-teacher.html) a curriculum field tested with high and middle school students at the Reed College and [Portland University](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/08/adventures-in-teaching-and-driving.html) campuses.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/21738915279/in/dateposted-public/)",
