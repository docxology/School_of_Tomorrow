(more digits).\n\nS & E are both slivers, splinters.\n\nThe topologically minimum container in ordinary space and ordinary language, is the tetrahedron.\u00a0 You don't have a volumetric \"cage\" with less than six edges, if constrained to constructing with sticks.\u00a0 Fuller accounts volume using aggregates of these slivers, which he names:\u00a0 A, B, T, E and S.\n\nYou can [look them up](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/findex/fx0900.html). They have plane nets and everything. A, B and T all have the same volume (1/24).\u00a0 E outweighs T by a tad, has the same shape.\u00a0 S is for Skew.\n\nSo VE:Icosa :: S:E is a volume thing.\u00a0 David Koski has been [playing with these blocks](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica5.html) and making lots of discoveries.\u00a0 Low hanging fruit (i.e. trite fruit) is plentiful in this [4D domain](http://4dsolutions.net/).\n\nLets do it in Python:\n\ne3 is simply Evol shrunk by 1/[phi](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2014/12/freaking-about-phi.html) i.e. all edges are .618... of what they were, with volume decreasing as 3rd power of that amount.\u00a0 Edges:Area:Volume grow and shrink in a 1, 2, 3 powering relationship when a shape changes size (duh).\n\nI agree this is [all pretty easy and accessible](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/06/math-avoidance.html), which in some circles is a mark of inferiority, of triteness.\n\n[ The fact that floating point numbers have noise digits on the end owing to base conversions etc. may be off-putting to \"[real numbers](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9742355)\" fans. ]\n\nClich\u00e9 Math we could call it.  Cut and Paste Math.\n\nSpeaking of which, the source code for studying the above modules is [available here](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2014-May/011026.html) on [edu-sig](https://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig/). \n\nThe source to render the above graphic is [also available](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2015-March/011203.html), but you'll need the free / open source [POV-Ray](http://povray.org/) ray tracing engine to get the final result.\n\nRejected, too-trite and/or [incomprehensible](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/incomprehensible.html) papers: \n[Bridging XYZ and IVM Volumetric Accounting Systems with the Square Root of 9/8](http://4dsolutions.net/synergetica/bridges_paper_final.pdf) by Kirby Urner\n[Revisiting R.B.
