  "content": ":: tweeting metaphysics ::\n\nI'm really not sure anyone cares about my Tweeting habits, least of all me.\u00a0 Actually, me more than most, no doubt, and that's not a lot.\u00a0 I would be sad to lose what I've tweeted so far.\u00a0 I don't go back and delete tweets, although I might right at the time, if I hate the typo that much.\n\nMy go to guy for Tweet advice has been Derek in large degree, a treasured blog character who does high level social work for very little direct compensation.\u00a0 I tell more of his story in my Food Not Bombs video, where I get in to what's been happening for me since my \"PhD years\".\u00a0 I'm back into meat and plastic a lot more, with less bicycle.\n\nI do have a bicycle though and use it.\u00a0 Dr. D. and I did the 14 miles, somewhat abbreviated as we came back on Division.\u00a0 That was the first time.\u00a0 The second time he got that flat and took the bus the final leg.\u00a0\n\nWe went from Blue House (old FNB shoptalk) to Springwater Corridor south through Oaks Park, across Sellwood to a continuation of said Corridor out to I-205, left before going under it, back across SE Powell (Hwy 26) to Division (or on to Mill to coast up the south side of Tabor, when I was younger and more fit).\n\nBack to tweeting:\u00a0 I used @thekirbster and @4DsolutionsPDX.\u00a0 I don't pay a lot of attention to DMs or bother tracking who's blocking whom.\u00a0 That's a \"board game\" I never really got that into.\u00a0 But that's not casting aspersions on those who did or do.\u00a0 We all choose our multiple playgrounds and partially overlap here and there.",
