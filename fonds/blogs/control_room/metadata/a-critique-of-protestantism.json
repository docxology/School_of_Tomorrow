  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/28634368460/in/album-72157665970258116/)\n\nHere's my theory, about Christianity more specifically, because of my own experience with that religion (I'll claim ignorance with respect to many others -- life is finite):\u00a0 one gets groomed to think \"rendering a moral judgement\" is ultimately what's called for.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAt the end of the day, we're waiting for some verdict.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nElon Musk is good.\u00a0 Elon Musk is bad.\u00a0 My attitude is more:\u00a0 who the fuck cares about your moral judgements in this matter; there's lots more that's more interesting to talk about.\u00a0 Including with respect to Elon.\n\nKinda like that.\n\nNow I may have the impression the Catholics are less judgemental, hence their name (\"catholic\" as in open minded, worldly, cosmopolitan), whereas Protestants are all about raining \"fire and brimstone\" (whatever that is) upon their moral inferiors.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAll that resentment about a \"holier than thou\" attitude traces to English pricks right?\u00a0 I'm kidding.\u00a0 You'll\u00a0 find pricks in every culture.\u00a0 Tea cuppy Victorians (soccer moms) and like that.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs if your moral pronouncements were what the big drum roll was all about.\u00a0 We were all in suspense about if you thought it was good or bad.\u00a0 That's such an arrogant attitude.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIt's not that we don't care what you think, it's that you just assume it's your moral attitude, your ethnic bias, that we're interested in.\u00a0 Why not ask us what we think matters?\u00a0 At least once in awhile?\n\nWhy do we have to care if such and such offends you.\u00a0 Were you asked?\u00a0 Entitlement.\n\nMaking Judgement Day the most important day in eternity, seems to be a hallmark of Protestantism especially.\u00a0 Why not Easter?",
