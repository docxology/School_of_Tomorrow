We shall see.\n\nAs I posted on Facebook recently: \n\n Our Multnomah Meeting spawned a Quaker Economics Group under Joe Havens for awhile, huge\n interest and attendance, but no one thought to coin \"Quakernomics\" as \nanything special at least that I can recall.  So hats off to these PR \ngurus and their new branch of economics.  May they live long and prosper\n (Spock sign).",
