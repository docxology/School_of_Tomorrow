  "content": "Although many Friends don't think of it this way, keeping accurate and complete records falls under the Truth Testimony.\n\n\"Are these records to be believed?\"\u00a0 If the answer is \"no\" then we may conclude:\n\n(A) they're meant as fiction (storytelling) perhaps with embedded teachings\n(B) they're obsolete (out of date) and in that sense misinforming\n(C) they're deliberately misinforming\n(D) the records are riddled with [outright lies](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/01/more-geopolitics.html).\n\nIn moving from A-D, I'm escalating the severity of the untruths.\n\nMany not-truthful records fall into category (B) within NPYM.\n\nWe have creaky, obsolete ways of conducting business.\u00a0 Collectively, we lack discipline as a business.\n\nSaying a nonprofit or 501(c)(3) \"is not a business\" is probably a grave error, one that kills off serious Quakerism by suggesting that our \"business\" (as in \"Meetings for Business\" -- a core activity) is not really business, and so the idea of applying serious \"business logic\" or \"business rules\" need not apply.\n\nThe lack of discipline in our record-keeping is thereby justified.\u00a0 \"Everyone knows non-profits are dysfunctional\" -- a belief I've encountered often.\n\nPerhaps it would be constructive to use the term NGO (for non-governmental organization) more assiduously?\u00a0 Personnel in the global development business know that [not all NGOs](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/06/visa-commercial.html) are slouches,\u00a0 Some NGOs have their act together, including with respect to record-keeping.\n\nWhat holds us back is the stereotype of a \"non-profit charity\" as a loose ship run by mostly volunteers, a hobby activity.\u00a0 The outcome:\u00a0 recreational Quakerism, not all that serious and typically middle class Christian, a religion being something people engage in \"on Sundays\" and on some holidays.\n\nThanks to the connotations of \"non-profit\", our \"business\" takes a back seat, including record-keeping, as Friends indulge in what they consider \"more spiritual\" matters.\u00a0 Record keeping is not sexy enough.\n\nNPYM Friends fall further and further behind, in terms of relevance, as they allow their \"business culture\" to continue to degrade.\u00a0 Quakers reached their peak in power and credibility sometime [in the late 1700s](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-quaker-arc.html), when they actually ran legitimate businesses.\n\nThe very idea of a \"[sectarian business](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/)\" is fairly unusual by now, at least as a marketing ploy.\u00a0 Everyone knows that Quaker ([the commercial brand](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/11/go-humans-go.html)) does not mean Quaker (the religious sect).\n\nWhen the Rajneeshis tried to start their own company town in central Oregon, they opened some storefronts in Portland, like a bakery, but those all were shut down, leaving a bad taste with many Oregonians (a twisted tale).\u00a0 Churches sometimes have gift shops at least.\u00a0 Christian supply stores abound like at The Grotto in Portland.\n\nAt some point, with the passage of time, the neglect starts to seem more willful and we move from (B) closer to (D) along the Scale of Untruthfulness.\n\nNot lifting a finger to become more up to date eventually becomes a way of lying, with lying becoming a way of life.\u00a0 Externalizing \"future shock\" so that others must endure it, but not oneself, is a way of postponing the day of reckoning.\u00a0 Answering the call of the Zeitgeist to \"shape up\" means keeping up with best practices around curating and record-keeping.\u00a0 [Graph database](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/graphing-relationships.html) anyone?\n\nI don't believe we need hirelings when it comes to the basics of Quaker record-keeping though.\u00a0 In today's world, these basics include knowing something about Structured Query Language (SQL) and databases. People in a clerking role should bone up on the relevant technology.\u00a0 It's not all ledger books and quill pens anymore.\u00a0 We do not live in Victorian England.\n\nBottom line:\u00a0 software engineering is not \"outside\" the spiritual sphere, but is rather at the core of our practice and has to do with the Truth Testimony.\u00a0 [Engineering is a spiritual activity](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/05/engineering-as-moral-enterprise.html).\n\nI'd like to address issues of lax discipline around \nrecord-keeping in the context of joining said standing Discipline Committee.\u00a0 The \nrole of \"clerk\" involves attention to records.\u00a0 Keeping our information \nup to date is a shared responsibility of clerks, not something to \noutsource or lay at the door of some paid person.\n\nAs the Technology Clerk, new position (unpaid of course), I've been agitating\n for ex oficio status on the Discipline Committee.\u00a0 I want our practices\n to improve [with respect to record-keeping](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=206&messageID=7344243).\u00a0 Lets see where that goes.\u00a0 I'm getting the feeling my proposal is not taken seriously yet.",
