  "content": "Two videographers capture the same performance in 2009, a Burning Man related event in Portland, Oregon.\n\nI was videographer #2 with the trippy wandering camera.\n\nVideographer #1 took an unwavering shot and got better sound.\n\nViewing suggestion:\u00a0 roughly synch and play both at once, while muting the sound on #2 using the Youtube speaker control (then unmute #2 if you want to continue a little longer). \n\n:: video 1 ::\n\n:: video 2 ::\n\nThe performer, Lindsey Walker, had recently moved from Savannah, Georgia.  She came in a Nissan with her own PA system (Bose), a keyboard, and a cat.\n\nHowever, for this performance she made use of the house sound system.\n\nWhat you're hearing though, is hand held camera pickup, hardly studio quality.\n\nI treasure this song all the more now that she doesn't play it anymore, or at least not in this form.\n\nLindsey still performs in and around Portland, sometimes as a street musician.\n\nYou will see her (briefly) in [the movie Occupation Nation](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/04/occupation-nation-movie-review.html) by Portland's B-Media Collective.",
