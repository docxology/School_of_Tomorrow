  "content": "Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based psyops firm, with state of the art \nalgorithms, tricks Facebook into divulging the data of millions (for \nwhich it now [faces fines](https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/facebook-cambridge-analytica.html)). Bannon is vice president, working closely \nwith Trump. [ Cambridge Analytica](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/02/keeping-tabs.html) has meddled in the foreign affairs of \nother countries as well.  It's one of these new technology PR = covert \nops manipulation companies.\n\nThe dupe Americans, though told this story (free press!) are Pavlovian creatures, trained to snarl and show\n fangs when Russians are mentioned, but flip over and show their cute \ntummies if ever a Brit needs a pet.  So even though Trump overtly \ncolluded with a foreign power, the FBI carefully said nothing about it. \n The story was 100% redacted from the Mueller report.\n\nCongratulations Americans!  You've fooled yourselves again.  Lincoln was right about you (before the Brits had him snuffed).",
