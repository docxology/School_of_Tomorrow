  "content": "Carol (mom) and I are about to drive across the river, against traffic (meaning with a faster trip time), for a dinner with Physicians for Social Responsibility.\u00a0 As [a veteran WILPFer](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/02/wilpf-on-road-was-tax-time.html), she's worked with the Oregon PSR rather closely, most especially on the Hiroshima - Nagasaki commemoration event, a time to pledge never again to indulge in nuclear war.\n\nSince WW2, the planet has endured several nuclear catastrophes, beginning with [so-called \"testing\"](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/golden-rule.html), which irreparably harmed the ecosystem, followed by nuclear meltdowns. The meltdown in Chernobyl was such that brave and selfless human intervention was possible.\n\nA tunnel was dug in record time to intercept the melting mass before it reached the water table.\u00a0 In the case of Fukushima, human bravery is irrelevant and the Pacific Ocean is becoming increasingly contaminated, and by extension the planet.\n\nThe responsible jobs, going forward, have to do with cleanup and disaster mitigation. Humans floating around on military ships, threatening each other, saber rattling, is a lot of toy story nonsense wherein humans refuse to grow out of their kindergarten stage.\n\nWe'll have to leave them to play those war games, as they insist, and have the weapons to stop us from stopping them, but we don't have to treat them as mature adults.\n\nI think a lot of the slowness to respond is about theater ([the T in PATH](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/05/telerama.html)).\u00a0 People used to think Kings (a few Queens) had divine powers. Even when that illusion exploded, politicians managed to keep up an illusion of being in control.\n\nThat these people actually do any [real work](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/07/what-is-work.html) is becoming less apparent.\u00a0 But then \"work\" in its physics meaning simply means \"to expend energy\" which we all do, of necessity, just to breath.\u00a0 Any meaning beyond that tends to be tinged by moralizing, with Protestants (Christians known for their protesting attitude) among the first to chime in.\n\nI need a haircut.\u00a0 My gray hair is bushy and I'm wearing a maroon turtle neck with not such fancy pants. I'm in the ballpark of \"frumpy academic\" I suppose, though I'm closer to [a Quaker crime boss](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/11/identity-politics.html) (it's considered traitorous to laugh at politicians is it not?).\u00a0 I've been posting [to Forum 206](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/06/from-forum-206.html) quite a bit. Does that make me a math teacher?\n\nSam Lanahan was by today with a truck load of C6XTY.\u00a0 I'll be able to organize workflows for kids, having them construct soccer ball looking things from six curved pieces held together with eight screws. Then come the arms, suitable for interconnecting them in a lattice.\n\nWhat's all this for?\u00a0 Do you know what the isotropic vector matrix (IVM) is?\u00a0 Octet truss?\u00a0 CCP?\u00a0 FCC (no not the government acronym).\u00a0 Maybe we're just sharing some memes at first, basic STEM.\n\nIt'll be awhile longer before humanity grows up.\u00a0 We're a work in progress.\n\nSome of us don't think we need to learn about hard stuff, like science and math, as long as we have our politician parents to take care of us.\u00a0 They'll protect us from the laws of physics, right?",
