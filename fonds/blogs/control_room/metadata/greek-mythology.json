  "content": "My standard rap when it comes to marketing and Python, is the Monty Python angle is certainly edgy, a stroke of brilliance on Guido's part, to go with something both snarky, contemporary, and with longevity, as even without the troupe of comedians in the foreground, we have an informative and entertaining backdrop [in Greek mythology](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2018-July/011975.html), with its Python.\n\nI speak, of course, of Mt. Parnassus and the story of the Delphic Oracle.\u00a0 She and her Cult of Athena temple nymphs were able to prophesy thanks to Python running inside their Virtual Machine (how I think of whatever VM their Python is running on -- a kind of mountain).\u00a0 Apollo sought to impose rationality on the beast (meant kindly), to slay in the sense of dominate, not render useless (closer to \"harness\" in English).\n\nPeople will take it in different directions.\u00a0 I'm at OSCON again, which I've linked to Gibson Guitar (actually Gibson [sent a bizmo](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/of-math-and-mythos.html) some years back, so I'm not saying I acted alone) and the Nashville music scene, noting the proud Temple to Athena in that city, her Python curled in her shield, Nike in hand.\n\n\"Just Use It\" is one of our slogans, testing reader understanding of the allusions.\u00a0 I've posted about a sign or poster in the Iceland airport, or somewhere else along a moving sidewalk.\u00a0 PSF would need to sign off in this use of the logo.",
