  "content": "\"everything is awesome!\" (so much gold!)\n\nSo King Thorin has a serious headache with all that gold, inherited from the [nasty dragon](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/09/leveraging-python.html).\u00a0 If he just lets it out the door then pretty soon it won't be that scarce.\u00a0 We saw how the villagers treated it, but how long would that last?\u00a0 It would have to be meted out, and you would need to be an Einstein, or [Milton Friedman](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9666526), to figure out the velocity of money issues.\u00a0 How fast would be the military build-up?\u00a0 Would inflation lead to food riots, with wheel barrows of gold barely buying a zucchini?\n\nWhat are orc children like?\u00a0 Did we see a hatchery in a back episode?\u00a0 Do Mr. & Mrs. Orc ever party, and do they form nuclear families at all?\u00a0 They don't appear to have much use for money in other words, or the finer things in life.\u00a0 That's probably why Smaug's Mountain has to be \"strategic\" in some battle ground, as a bunch of gold is not attractive enough.\n\nIndeed, what can gold buy you?\u00a0 The Elves have what they need so remain aloof.\u00a0 No HDTV, no iPhones... there's precious little money can buy back then, and one gets tired of mere jewelry and gold bricks used for street pavement.\u00a0 So what?\u00a0 What's so \"wealthy\" about streets paved with gold when you get right down to it?\u00a0 Slippery, impractical.\u00a0 Back to Thorin's nightmare.\n\nOne can almost read Gandalf's lips there at the end when he says Bilbo is a terrible liar.\u00a0 We all know he's got the ring and Gandalf understands the Shire is the best place for it as the saga continues, with Mordor on its military build-up, post face-off with the [elvyn chyk](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/unconference.html) (tail tuck time).\u00a0 We know that in the audience as well, that Gandalf is just biding his time, plus the book readers among us even better understand how the ring is increasing Bilbo's willingness to lie, never mind how bald facedly i.e. badly.\n\nThe first of the three Hobbit films got me claustrophobic and I'm reminded by last night's Solstice banter that the book is that way too.\u00a0 Now that I've seen [the Snowden documentary](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/11/citizenfour-movie-review.html), I can't help but make the pun \"snowed in\" and draw the parallel of getting stuck in some hotel room in Hong Kong for N hours.\u00a0 Lets just start on some adventure already!\u00a0 People should let up on Assange.\u00a0 In general, lets be a lot less Mordor-like, less Orc-like, if we really think [the Hobbits](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/intourist-pdx.html) won or deserved to.\n\n[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/3273/1616/400/mffront.1.jpg)",
