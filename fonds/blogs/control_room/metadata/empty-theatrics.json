  "content": "Lots of laughter in Portland as the Water Bureau drains a bazillion gallons because somebody peed in the reservoir.\n\nIs there any science behind it?\n\nI was up there today and watched them hose out a swimming pool the size of a lake.\u00a0 Ducks poop in that water too, but no headlines then.\n\nI think the point is to:\n\n(a) get some overtime pay, not a problem\n\nand\n\n(b) remind shallow non-thinkers why we need to take the best water in any municipality, fresh from Mount Hood, and turn it into the same underground / canned stuff everyone else has (piss poor).\n\nPeople hear about Portland having better water and get jealous.\n\nThe EPA doesn't like that, makes other cities look bad, raises questions, so the better thing, they think, would be to just make Portland's \"best water\" reputation go away.\n\nDraining the lake for no good reason is part of the campaign.\n\nBut are Portlanders buying it?\u00a0 Clearly not.\u00a0 It's a joke.",
