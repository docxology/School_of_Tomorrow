I might not be in Portland as frequently as I have been.\n\nMy daughters, friends and family would be welcome here, perhaps in some admin capacity.\u00a0 Tara is next in line to help design the circuit.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe family business is merging with the Global U in a way that keeps logistics non-onerous.\n\nI'm a big believer in institutional wealth.\u00a0 You don't need to own an aircraft carrier or submarine to live on one. Ownership of the supersonic jets, the space station, the racetrack, is likewise not my forte.\u00a0 On the other hand, I'm into storyboarding, like an investment bank, or movie-maker.\n\nAs one more student-faculty member, I'm into enjoying the Global U responsibly.\u00a0 That's how I bring credit to my school.",
