  "content": "I continue brainstorming about [remote technovillages](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/project-earthala.html) wherein we'd showcase tomorrow's lifestyles today, including through reality television. One model is Oregon's [Breitenbush](http://www.breitenbush.com/), where a year round community provides the staffing for the visitor facilities -- all very laid back and rustic.Lots of public school teachers'd come through on the public dime, as a part of their inservice training. They'd go home full of new ideas, about [Pythonic mathematics](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-pythonic-mathematics.html) and such.Culturally speaking, it's difficult to win budget for such [USA OS](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html) facilities, as anything so kwel and cutting edge gets appropriated as lures by the military's recruiters. Civilians aren't supposed to get out in front when it comes to high tech toyz, especially given the brokeback army and overstressed marines, with two whole foreign countries to keep safe from competing fundamentalisms (or whatever the mission, I've lost track, but anyway it's ongoing job security for a lot of career [Iron Mountain](http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/iron.html) types, helps 'em stay outta trouble).Of course the compromise is to make these showcase remote techie towns [paramilitary](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/12/action-figure.html). Marines could train on their new biodiesel dirt bikes, preparing to protect the desert medevac communities we'd like to rapidly deploy to Darfur and such places, to get civilians out of their death camps and into something more comfortable.If the USA were to source disaster relief in high gear, as it started doing during the South Asian Tsunami, that'd improve national security, as enemies wouldn't have such an easy time pointing to an out of control blundering idiot, mindlessly spazzing out around the globe, destroying civilian infrastructure, scaring everyone witless. Nobody loves Moron Nation, the puppet of a dying LAWCAP (what our gentle genius [Medal of Freedom winner](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/02/valentines-day-2006.html) called the loser paradigm).New Mexico would be a good state in which to get going with these experimental prototype communities of tomorrow. I would have said Florida, given Walt Disney already had the right idea ([EPCOT](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/09/return-to-moon.html)). But LAWCAP's top management took over The Mouse and pretty much destroyed Disney's dream, turned it into another dreary moneymaking enterprise.",
