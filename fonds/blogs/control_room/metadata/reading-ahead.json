You're not doing Orientation, Kick Off Talks, Chirality... exactly, but no matter, nevermind.\u00a0\n\nYou've discovered the curriculum is multi-modal, a fancy way of saying multi-medium.\u00a0\n\nYou've become more of a devotee of the blog genre anyway, and so here you are, let us say.\n\nI'd reward you then, with some previews.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nJ. Krishnamurti in particular has a language not unlike Ouspensky's in recognizing the botness of we hubots. We Are the Robots (Kraftwerk).
