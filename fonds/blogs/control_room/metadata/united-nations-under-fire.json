  "content": "A cabal is firing up its bots (paid stooges) to hate and fear the United Nations a lot more.\u00a0 The main issue is of course Israel and the UN's attempt to figure out what's \"legal\" with regard to forced colonization and land seizures.\n\nThe US well knows that it would be nowhere near its present size were the UN around in the good old days.\u00a0 Tribal nations would have asserted their rights and come to some settlement.\n\nIsrael's current plan (such as anyone has one) is to play by those older rules.\u00a0 That's what makes the drama all so Biblical in the minds of many Christians, not to mention apocalyptic. Relive the wild west. One can almost hear the player piano.\u00a0 Welcome to Westworld, where people and bots are really hard to distinguish.\n\nThe question as to whether nation-states must be taken seriously gets a variety of responses, depending on context.\u00a0 Many of them are broke on paper and dependent on the largess of transnational enterprises for continued solvency.\u00a0 Greece and the US are in the same boat on this one.\n\nGiven the rise of Trumpism in the US, more people are willing to admit that particular soap opera is over.\u00a0 Planet Earth is a single ecosystem inhabited by reprogrammable humans.\u00a0 \"How reprogrammable?\" is the core question, i.e. will our belief systems adapt to new circumstances?\n\nPsychometrics firms are busy discovering answers.\u00a0 Social media have been added to the equation.\u00a0 Theories swirl that Russian intelligence is powerful enough to tip elections, with firms such as Cambridge Analytica claiming similar powers.\u00a0 How much of such claims is marketing hype and propaganda?\n\nTV has been the reprogramming device of choice for several decades and still is.\u00a0 Radio too.\u00a0 When it comes to shaping public opinion using psychological techniques, sophistication has improved with the evolution of broadcast advertising.\u00a0 The Internet allows for more specific targeting and individualized data collection.\n\nThe word \"programming\" and verb \"to program\" have a unifying aspect when applied to both TV and computers.\u00a0 We program both.\u00a0 Humans are already trans-human in the sense of a \"cell-silicon interface\" i.e. our brains have already been augmented.\u00a0 The synergetic effects have been amazing.\n\nWhere does the Jungian notion of a collective unconscious fit in?\u00a0 I think in that idea we have something of an antidote to paranoia about any one specific cabal or conspiracy steering the show. A lot of content wells up within each individual.\u00a0 In some sense, we're all wireless devices.\n\nAnother reason the UN is coming under fire has to do with the Treaty to Ban Nuclear Weapons, connected to the ICAN campaign, Nobel Peace Prize (2017) and so on.\u00a0 DC and [Jerusalem](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profiles/blogs/jerusalem-world-capital) need to harden themselves for their Cowboys versus Indians role, wherein the cowboys are (a) outnumbered but (b) have nukes (or think they do).\u00a0 Stay tuned.\n\nUltimately [the sun powers the planet](http://grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html), in terms of energy.\u00a0 Even fossil fuels trace back to ancient sunlight.\u00a0 Agriculture is a solar energy business.\u00a0 For any human institution to insert itself and take credit for all the wealth is of course absurd.\u00a0 Our shared wealth has extra-human origins, which is not to make any claims regarding ETs.",
