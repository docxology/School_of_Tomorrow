  "content": "I'd already planned to leave the Nissan in the shop when I went to California.\u00a0 They told me last time, something about needing valve cover replacements or something.\u00a0 Well, I waited a little too long I guess because those lights on the dash meant what they said:\u00a0 I was eating through the battery; mom and I pulled up the driveway from Old Wives Tales, after the AFSC meeting, with zero Joules to spare.\u00a0 Trying to restart confirmed:\u00a0 battery dead.\n\nFortunately, I'm up to date [with AAA](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/10/future-of-friends.html) and my annual dues covered the tow to Gladstone, near Oregon City.\u00a0 That was Thursday morning.\u00a0 This Monday, all was repaired, including the new alternator.\u00a0 The spray or leakage from the decayed valve covers is what had damaged the alternator over time.\u00a0 Front and back brakes were down to 10%.\u00a0 Other repairs needed.\u00a0 The grand total was over $1800 2013 US dollars, paid against a standing loan (the credit card).\u00a0 Why I put it on the non-mileage VISA I'll never know.\u00a0 My right and left brain don't always talk I guess.\n\nI've been concerned about the python, with which I share an office.\u00a0 The dog comes by quite often as well.\u00a0 During office hours, I'm more with non-humans than not, but the snake has been very balled up in his box, his shack within the larger aquarium.\u00a0 Tonight, he came out.\u00a0 I'd sneaked him a test mouse earlier, picking one up on the way back from Gladstone.\u00a0 He passed the test.\u00a0 I should give him another one before leaving for California.\u00a0 Must dry clean the jacket.\u00a0 Works out.\u00a0 Mouse store and dry cleaner are adjacent and within walking distance.\n\nLindsey professes to despise the [Blue House Party Mix](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/10/blue-house-party-mix.html), though I think both videos were new to her.\u00a0 Dumb uninteresting beats, is her take, as a musician.\u00a0 I guess that makes me easy to please, although I do like her more off beat experimental stuff sometimes.\u00a0 We didn't get to that \"[all video-game sounds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYxfxf3wTLM&feature=share&list=RD15C_0qCrZW4kY)\" version of [Gangnam Style](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/10/corrupting-oldsters.html), just as well.\u00a0 114/94/SAT was my work today, a shorthand I've developed, chicken scratches.\u00a0 Patrick would know what I meant.\u00a0 He chauffeured me past Cleveland High School, Tara's old haunt, and Oak's Bottom, Dawn's and mine, in route to Gladstone.\u00a0 We at first missed the Nissan repair place because I'd misremembered the Nissan layout.\u00a0 No biggie.\u00a0 We drove home separately, reunited at The Open Bastion.\n\nWhat Marx called product fetishism is real enough, as is consumerism as a lifestyle.\u00a0 Shopping.\u00a0 Some like to eBay all day.\u00a0 Trading is turnover and variety is the spice of life.\u00a0 I expect to receive a ton of philosophy books tomorrow.\u00a0 Blue House is like grand central these days, with lots of comings and goings.\u00a0 On the other hand, the power of having the right tools for the job should not be trivialized with dime store psychology.\u00a0 Honing in on artifacts, such as cameras, even jewelry (some ornaments are also instruments in some science), is not anti-Marxist per se, but nor is it about being intimidated by Marxist labels.\u00a0 The Blue House Party Mix obviously celebrates new / vogue technology and the accompanying razzmatazz (bling).\u00a0 That seems superficial, if tools can't be deep.\n\n[Alan Watts](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/10/satori.html) used to point out that shopper-consumers were often the antithesis of Materialists.\u00a0 They were in pursuit of a concept of a concept of happiness (pointers to pointers) and the mundane reality of materials was actually no longer capable of inducing thrills.\u00a0 The idea of being at a certain restaurant was more important than the food forgettably consumed.\u00a0 American Psycho comes to mind, for alluding to such a lifestyle.\n\nThen lets look at Debt:\u00a0 The First 5000 Years, and review the meaning there given \"communism\".\u00a0\u00a0 You may be sure the professoriate is \"going here\" i.e. today's colleges are already abuzz with some new thinking (not a new phenomenon right?).\u00a0 The meanings of words do not hold fixed spontaneously and in fact it takes work and review to uphold a meaning.\u00a0 Stories pegged to seasonal changes, star patterns and so on, have a longer half life than some.\u00a0 Political stories, sustained by journalism, can sometimes just fizzle.\u00a0 You reach a kind of terminus and there seems nowhere next to go, like a StopIteration exception in Python.\u00a0 [The generator](http://wikieducator.org/PYTHON_TUTORIALS#Generators) is exhausted.\u00a0 The bandwidth is a scarce resource I suppose you could say, not asynchronously so much as when everyone has their tightly scripted part.\u00a0 Some of the fancier stuff can't be done without bandwidth.\u00a0 Banks fail for this reason, people simply lose interest, to recycle an old pun.\n\nThe story is one of Mind continuing to pull the rug from under merely copied or habitual behaviors.\u00a0 A given Brain might be happy doing the same thing every day, but the humans' gift is to receive grace, no need to argue if it's divine.\u00a0 Of course it is, if by this means we shed the old reflexes and habits in favor of and in service of, some actual will, a chooser / decider, some executive function.\u00a0 That means there might be somebody home, albeit non-computable / unpredictable, and therefore a plan of action, and not just action.\u00a0 We need both.\u00a0 \"Computable\" is in contrast to.\n\nThoughts that hold water need not always hold water.\u00a0 The Holy Spirit keeps moving, as some religious might put it, meaning the forms continue to reform.\u00a0 Morphing happens.\u00a0 The beats change and draw us onward.\u00a0 And let us remember that in morphing may be healing; not all change is injurious.\u00a0 Letting go of conversations that displace more worthy conversations:\u00a0 a spontaneous / emergent process.\n\nEnough metaphysics for one evening's blog post I'd say.\u00a0 My focus needs to turn towards the morrow.",
