[Dr. Martin](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3714228417/) (emeritus) is hosting an afternoon HB2U type event and mom never gets to see him almost, Bob being [Roberta's](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/renewing-old-ties.html) partner, so I said we'd turn up there, after a clearness for membership meeting in the [Beanite tradition](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/rocket-science.html) ([NPYM](http://www.npym.org/)).  I serve on Oversight and [WQM planning](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/10/wqm-fall-2005.html) for Multnomah, as local AFSC liaison for Bridge City.  Last time I actually saw Marco was probably [at Axis of Evil](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/11/standup-comedy-at-newmark-theater.html) that time, whereas mom met [with Pam](http://www.quaker.org/agate-passage/letter_from_john_munson.htm), now with the City.Saturday (today) isn't so packed for me, though for mom it's [a board meeting](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3711549938/) (me as chauffer), Tara close to going but with last minute fine tuning, switching to [Saturday Market](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/12/saturday-market-2007.html) instead, with other Qs, me joining later.Last night was MVPs at Local Lounge (circa MLK & Fremont), all very smooth and professional (Randy good at bartending), more listening than dancing, with ample amplification.  [Leslie and Lindsey](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3709466238/) got to meet; two Wanderers.  I wasn't chaufferring anyone, just had [a good time](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/music-scene.html).I should call TC, check out the new HDTV.I did some reconnaisance in Finnegan's after leaving [Elizabeth Braithwaite](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/03/labyrinth.html) with the girls, checking the civilization level.  They still traffic in [dark ages maps](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3710749613/) 'n stuff in this city, but that's to be expected around here (Jordanians take note).At least Cleveland (PPS) has some of [the right stuff](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3292180674/).  I expect we'll see more by September, given work on [the DM track](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/dm-hallmarks.html) is proceeding apace, more planning sessions upcoming.A high point of today was the [Electric Car Festival](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157602209081561/) in Pioneer Courthouse Square.  [Geek Squad](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3711555080/) was there with the segways.  I struck up a conversation [about Weird Al](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmVdAjBe9dE).Congratulations to [SocoHanoi](http://socohanoi.com/About_SocoHanoi.html) on a new coworking venture, on my radar through Google Groups.",
