  "content": "So while growing up as an expat helped me become worldly, I was left behind vis-a-vis [King Crimson](http://www.google.com/musica?aid=8GmytegNq0I&sa=X&oi=music&ct=result) or whatever, didn't have the standard cultural savvy upon arriving at Princeton.I showed up a week early, lived on spam from WaWa -- because I'd heard spam was a thing to experience.My roommate from Long Island found that completely different, coming to Princeton to encounter a spam eating guy from [Magallanes Village](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magallanes_Village) (ironically so named by the people who ate him).To this day, I'm out of sequence on a lot of stuff.I first encountered Katie when she started hitting CBS radar, then through [Shark Tale](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/08/shark-tale-movie-review.html).  Seems everyone else already knew from [Leno](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAEF0ZXUGLo) that her biceps were bigger than [Evil Bert's](http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/blosamabert.htm).I got into Sesame Street in high school, already wearing my future [TV producer hat](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/vidconcept.html).My first car, a Honda Civic, was a present from my grandmother at age 28.  Up until then, I'd mostly used public transportation, plus hitch hiked a lot (more some other time perhaps).Nor have I ever seen a Sopranos, nor any Desperate Housewives (that I can remember anyway (OK, some excerpts)).  Kinda weird huh?  Go figure.Most of middle America I've not seen, though we had Nebraska plates overseas some of the time, military base access (inexpensive scuba).  Western Pennsylvania is cool, Montana.I was born in Chicago, May 17, 1958.",
