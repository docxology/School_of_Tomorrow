  "content": "So it's a First Day, Sunday in layspeak, and I'm keeping it holy by goofing off, as our Lord said we should, not working, at least one day a week (the \"virtual Sunday\" concept -- keeps supermarkets open 24/7/365).So that was to mean letting Tara install Sims 2 on KTU3, so I could test [Camtasia Studio](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/01/reviewing-my-oscon-2005-talk.html) against Sim University. Ah, but Disc 2 has gone missing. In scrounging for it, I found Quake 4.Given my Quakers Play Quake bumper sticker, I should install that, and show how I suck at playing it (but I do play it, from time to time, mostly just against myself, losing often).Some of my detractors decry the fact of avowed pacifists indulging in stylized violence of any kind, but the whole point of pacifism is to style how we might wage war [nonviolently](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/crosscultural-workouts.html) (they say that's a contradiction, I say it's the [Lamb's War](http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/n/nayler_j.shtml) (Jihad)).Nope, Quake 4 is short one disc as well. Some other time then.I still like Jevetta Steele's rendition of [Bagdad Caf\u00e9](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095801/), from the original soundtrack, the best of all the renditions I've heard.",
