  "content": "I include this partly in contrast to Samsara (below).\n\nWhereas Samsara is beautifully filmed and provides no commentary, Earthlings is about the slaughter of non-humans by humans in ways we would consider cruel and inhumane (including in so-called \"kosher\" facilities).\u00a0 The narrator provides a point of view.\n\nThe film looks at animals as pets, sources of food and clothing, entertainment, scientific knowledge. \n\nEarthlings feeds a sense of misanthropy (hatred of humans).\n\nMark Twain:\u00a0 of all of God's creatures, Man is the most detestable.\u00a0 Yes, that's obvious.\u00a0 Many angels think so too.\n\nMisanthropy is probably too simplistic a response though.\n\nIn a reincarnation system, we might suppose humans return as the animals they kill.\u00a0 That would be called \"poetic justice\" by many.\u00a0 However, the sum total is just a lot of meaningless suffering, however it goes down.\n\nHatred of existence itself is another meditation one might practice, perhaps as a stage along some path.\u00a0 Life is an ongoing holocaust, 24/7/365.\u00a0 Are you part of the problem (adding to the net total suffering) or part of the solution (decreasing to the net total suffering)?\n\nIf you suffer a lot yourself, that doesn't necessarily help matters, but perhaps you can't help it.\u00a0 We're just little humans and Universe is really big.\u00a0 Victimhood seems a natural condition and humans have often cast themselves in this way, against a greater cosmic backdrop.\n\nLCDs in schools of philosophy might be more likely to screen such content than religious schools, although in some cultures that distinction is not made.",
