  "content": "Steve held an [OSCON](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/07/oscon-xv.html) Survivors' Breakfast at the Hilton. \u00a0I was pleased to have some face time with [Deb Bryant](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/07/oscon-2011-continues.html), [Allison Randal](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/looking-ahead.html), [Eric Holsher](https://readthedocs.org/), [Lindsay Epstein](http://portland.activatehub.org/) and others. \u00a0Some of us Portland natives also attend the Wanderers meetings.\n\nLater that evening, again with Steve as a catalyst, I enjoyed a fine dinner with Julie Steele (with O'Reilly Media), Steve and Yarko, followed by more conversation at Greater Trumps. \u00a0From Julie I learned I should never skip [the Friday keynotes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVZxkFAIziA), which I had.\u00a0 Good thing [they're taped](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0H0BKrF4HY).\n\nThe chair's party was well attended. \u00a0Edd Dumbhill is the outgoing chair, with incoming chairs Matthew and Simon. \u00a0I got permission to invite David Feinstein to this party and introduced him to Simon. \u00a0I then drifted off and joined Yarko and Alex Martelli, who were speaking with the Code for America CTO, Michal Migurski.\n\nCode for America focuses on making government more accessible and transparent. \u00a0The process has its pitfalls. \u00a0Local IT is maybe itching to try its hand with newer technologies but gets slapped down by management. \n\nThen C4A shows up, a whiz bang team, and wins praise from the same management as genius outsiders. \u00a0The natives grumble.\n\nHow might C4A catalyze more appreciation for in-house talent? \u00a0Show management what's possible but then fade away. \u00a0It's a tiny program anyway. \u00a0Inspire but don't micromanage.\n\nOf course I'm thinking \"[USA OS](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/usa-os.html)\" the whole time, what with whitehouse.gov folks working on some public APIs. \u00a0These petitions people sign: \u00a0there's mineable data there, which should be shared.\n\nThe confusion about Open Source versus Open Data is still prevalent. \u00a0When you invite development using shared open source tools, you are helping to level the playing field.\u00a0 They have access to these tools without high cost barriers.\u00a0 However tools are not data and confidentiality stays important.\n\nWhen the free tools are used, the schools aren't left out, because they can afford free software. They can also help improve it, to where the free tools are often among the best tools in their class.\n\nOne trains up an army conversant with PostgreSQL, other open APIs. \u00a0So then what? \u00a0Does government have the courage to use the same tools that schools can afford to teach?\n\nThat's a critical equation. \u00a0In some countries the verdict is in: \u00a0yes.\n\nOpen data offers its own set of advantages, but should not be confused with sharable tools. \u00a0Just because you know how to hack does not mean you have automatic access to private records.\n\nI missed way more talks than I managed to attend, that much is certain. \u00a0Netflix gave a good one I'm told. \u00a0People are turning to the Internet for their information and entertainment more and more. \u00a0Cell phones have only accelerated this trend.\n\nFacebook is building special data centers with their own power specs, for all those pictures you want to keep in your profile, but which no one retrieves on a daily basis.\u00a0 Cold storage, which doesn't mean unresponsive.\u00a0 Humanity is evolving new organelles.\u00a0 Motherboard Earth is an evolving picture.\n\nAs usual, I was inspired to dive more deeply into various technologies thanks to these talks. \u00a0Simon's talk got me interested in Erlang, while the drone talk (a keynote -- nothing weaponized) impressed me with the relevance of Clojure. \u00a0I now have both installed and am working through Safari Books in my copious free time (sarcastic chuckle).\n\nTomorrow: \u00a0more chauffeuring of MVPs. \u00a0Another trip to the airport. \u00a0I'm happy to play [the role](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/chauffeur-duty.html).\n\nCongrats to Tara, who attended the brunch, on getting the driver's license and repairing her phone, two summer goals.\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/9564623905/)",
