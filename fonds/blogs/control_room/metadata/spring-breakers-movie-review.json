  "content": "I've started on a plan to watch a lot of Harmony Korine films.\u00a0 The Bagdad kicked it off [with Spring Breakers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2101441/), but Christine ([a film maker](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/03/argo-movie-review.html)) showed me [Gummo](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/05/gummo-movie-review.html) first.\n\nThe film somewhat mocks the Spring Breaker as a type, a species, that never wants to break character.\u00a0 Once in a swim suit, they stay in a swim suit, or partially out of them, as if clothes really had no protective value (and they don't, against bullets).\n\nThere's a Survival aspect in the way these girl survivors winnow down to the two we're warned are baddest at the beginning.\u00a0 They're bad all right (as in \"bad ass\" thinks the Breaker), hard core.\u00a0 One might segue to Thelma and Louise at the end, given no good may come of it.\u00a0 They think as one unit, as Borg, or two Debbies from The Oblongs.\n\nOne might think of this as the R-rated sequel to that [It's Friday music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0).\n\nNow watch the first four minutes of [this Occupy film](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/04/occupation-nation-movie-review.html).\n\nYou've just learned a lot about how hedonism and consumerism help contain the tribes.\u00a0 \"What?\u00a0 Contain?\u00a0 They're out of control!\".\n\nThe Breakers proselytize, but aren't missionaries, and they have no standing army or sprawling priesthood.\u00a0 They do not rape and pillage or set fire to small villages in Southeast Asia.\u00a0 Yes, the girls enjoy the fundraising aspect, which is both thrilling and extortionist.\u00a0 Girls with guns get awfully cocky.\n\nWith \"gangsta girls\" in charge, you go up a rung [from imperialist Patriarchy](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/defending-homeland.html).\u00a0 Many will frown at that contention and say good Christians are more benign than this orgiastic frenzied devil-worshiping mob.\u00a0 No, these were the good Christians, look how they call their mothers.\u00a0 It's the men who seem more corralled and inhibited (not subdued, not unduly oppressed), and I'm saying that's [a step up](http://youtu.be/nET_ritoaNM).\n\nGirls are better at \"going wild\" in some ways, less Fascist-Apollonian, [more Athenian](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/temple-to-athena.html).\n\nHow much like Burning Man (Burners) or the Country Fair near Eugene (Cascadians), or Rainbow Gathering? \n\nThe desert is less forgiving than sunny Florida, and hippies mix in their studies more, versus swinging to both extremes.\u00a0 Protective clothing is likewise far more necessary in the forest.\n\nThose hippies and punks tend to geek out more (Tarot anyone?), are more DIY, plus maybe use a different mix of controlled substances.\n\nNone of these \"live forevers\" (like in Groundhog Day) seemed interested in learning scuba or marine science.\u00a0 Their inability to get passed eternal frolicking marked them as still bambi-like in those bathing suits.\u00a0 They'd get older, if not badder.\n\nNo review of this movie would be complete without some mention of the soundtrack and the \"loading gun\" swipe sound. What could so easily be an amateur's touch proves an effective suspense builder.\u00a0 It also sounds something like a camera (lots of shutter action).\u00a0 The camera itself is a weapon and or precision tool, a scalpel perhaps, for this skillful postmortem.\n\nThe editing style is also worthy of notice, with short repeat loops, a kind of \"going over a few times\" (like \"scratch\" in DJ world), mixed with flash backs to longer ago.\u00a0 Events emerge in collages versus one strict chronology, a scrap book effect, jumbled-frenetic.\u00a0 Blended memories.",
