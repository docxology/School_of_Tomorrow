  "content": "One could stay I'm still on the job, what with Python on the big screen in front of me.\u00a0 Sam phoned, \"a poster child for the 'underwater' economy\".\u00a0 He and Judy designed and built that dream home but it's not agricultural land and carpentry does not mix with arthritis.\u00a0 People do not have the usual means and fantasize [about Agenda 21](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/09/ghost-cities.html), wishing something even better would happen.\n\nMy idea for high desert secluded schools, boarding schools, but with plenty of bandwidth, has been baking in these blogs for a long time.\u00a0 Search on Project Earthala.\u00a0 But that's in Alternative Universe (Other Tomorrow) wherein we're doing science fiction things, not that we aren't now.\u00a0 You know what I mean.\u00a0 Sam and Judy would be faculty, manage the radio station (students need experience as broadcasters).\n\nI really enjoyed my tour of WEFT in Champaign, a cultural headquarters.\u00a0 I can listen on-line through i-Tunes like the boss does (one of 'em).\u00a0 Actually a couple of our mentors host radio shows, I think I've mentioned over the years.\n\nWhat has any of this to do with Python User Group meetup of September 10, 2013?\u00a0 Not much so far.\u00a0 I'm enjoying the air conditioning in what used to be the Meier & Frank warehouse building, where they had the sales.\u00a0 Now it's about wind power and Urban Airship.\u00a0 I sure saw a lot of wind power fans (\"windmills\") across the prairies of Illinois.\u00a0 Not everywhere, but in patches.\u00a0 Perhaps there's a zoning map I could call up in ArcGIS or Google Earth or something.\n\nMaureen phoned about some amazing film at the Hollywood tonight, Walking the Camino.\u00a0 She'd sold me on going (by myself) but the whole time I was thinking it was Monday.\u00a0 I've been thinking that all day.\u00a0 No, doh!\u00a0 It's a Tuesday, Python User Group, and/or Wanderers.\u00a0 Not a movie night.\u00a0 But I've got it blogged.\u00a0 I'll be back.\n\nAs a Subgenius I'm supposed to be good at cutting myself slack, but what does that look like really?\u00a0 If you talk yourself into thinking your work is what you might do in your spare time, then it can look like slack, but are you fooled?\u00a0 Some of the selves, some of the time.\u00a0 OK, I'll shut up now:\u00a0 Python's starting.\n\nSquawkathon, that looks interesting.\u00a0 Software nerds collaborating with sea birds to help them stay alive.\u00a0 Lots get caught in big nets.\u00a0 Hard to believe the deadline for Pycon talks (2014) is this Sunday.\u00a0 I should go more backwater, to the high desert schools, giving pep talks to the most committed.\u00a0 Would there be an AFSC angle?\u00a0 Quakers have a history of founding schools.\u00a0 I'll let them database me as \"Dr.\" through Earlham.\u00a0 I'm getting lots of snailmail for Applewhites Visit Oregon from Comcast and such, don't ask me how that happened (they did visit Oregon). \n\nMiguel Grinberg's presentation on Flask was stellar.\u00a0 Very intelligible and cruft free, like Flask itself.\u00a0 Students come in with their Immersive backpacks and upload the hike recordings to school servers.\u00a0 A simple Flask application, student / faculty maintained, serves out the files.\u00a0 Design Science.\u00a0 More with less.\u00a0 Read Miguel's tutorial -- many nods.\u00a0 He's a great teacher.\u00a0 He made a joke about his accent, which I found charming.\n\nSteve was passing out though, still recovering from Chicago.\u00a0 We trundled off for food and beverage before the Selenium talk.\u00a0 This was a taxi night.\u00a0 Parking is rough and who wants to be driving around then, if not professionally.\u00a0 Sometimes the chauffeur gets driven, just as someone else cuts (and styles) the barber's hair.\u00a0\n\nMichelle did the lion's share of the work on this one, as usual.\u00a0 Steve and I did our part by wandering around the meetup room looking for how to shut off the ambient music, over which our speakers would have been talking.\u00a0 Steve found the control panel.\u00a0 This is a fine meeting room by the way.\u00a0 Other groups use it too, which is why the upcoming hackathon will be somewhere else, perhaps in close quarters with the Ruby people.\u00a0 At work we're talking about cross-training more.\u00a0 The term \"full stack engineer\" is like new code for \"Renaissance person\".",
