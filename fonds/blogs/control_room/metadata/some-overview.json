Logo and Scheme, both influenced by LISP, Iverson's APL (and later [J](http://www.jsoftware.com/)), Guido's Python, all share this feature, as does xBase (e.g. dBase, FoxPro), another language that's been important to me.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/trajectory.jpg)my trajectory '58-'80Sometimes sharing autobiography is helpful. Above I'm sketching my trajectory from a 1958 birth in Chicago, through my Princeton chapter (Class of 1980), where I majored in philosophy, but also dove into computer science to some degree.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/infrastructure.jpg)Pythonic infrastructureToday's picture is rather complicated, Python being implemented in at least three system languages:  C, Java and C# (plus whatever those Nokia cell phones use).  The C# version, called [IronPython](http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython), sits atop the .NET engine with its [Common Language Infrastructure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Infrastructure) (CLI).Since Microsoft defined much of the .NET API as a public standard through [ECMA](http://www.mono-project.com/ECMA), a Linux version, named [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) (\"moe no\" not \"mah no\" i.e.  monkey in Spanish) is evolving to bring .NET (\"dot net\") capability to the Linux platform as well.IronPython should provide a lot of cross-platform capability twixt Linux and Windows, if Mono keeps up to speed.A student wanted to know to what extent Python is used to make quality games.  I talked about game engines, written in a faster system language, supporting [Python bindings](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Game_Programming_in_Python) for higher level scripting, and about [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) as a good example.During this same class, I demonstrated getting Fibonacci Numbers from a [Python generator](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html) and their convergence to 1/phi, [phi](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/geometry-in-nature.html) being the ratio of a [regular pentagon's](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/mathcasting-about-phi.html) diagonal to its edge.  Note that some authors switch the meanings of phi and tau, plus many use the Greek letters \u03c6 and \u03c4.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/rotation.jpg)rotating by thetaMost student coding time was spent modifying [orbits.py](http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/orbits.py), a module I wrote while on vacation in sunny Florida at [Bud's house](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/back-to-silicon-forest.html).  I've published [more information](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1493433&tstart=0) about this module and its context in the Math Forum archives.Related blog posts: [More Pythonic Mathematics](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-pythonic-mathematics.html), [Whiteboard Doodles](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/whiteboard-doodles.html), [Next Generation](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/10/next-generation.html), [New Wings](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/new-wings.html)",
