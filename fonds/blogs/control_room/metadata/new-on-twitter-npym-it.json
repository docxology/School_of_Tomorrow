  "content": ":: @npym_it twitter account launches :: \n\nThe first tweet is a link to the job description i.e. how the IT Committee serves NPYM Meetings and Annual Session. This is a new committee as of October, 2014.\n\nI'm the Technology Clerk with Alberta Hill the Facilitation Clerk (when we have meetings, she clerks them).\n\nWe mostly work with development teams and interested parties on things like (a) registering and organizing for Annual Session (b) Directory Services.\u00a0 We may also poll member meetings (e.g. invite them to participate in surveys) and consult with them regarding appropriate technologies for conducting their business.",
