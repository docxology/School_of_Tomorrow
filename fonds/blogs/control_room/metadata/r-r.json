Earlier, it was more [about funding](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4788403).Our party:  Gayle (friend), Kirby (self), Dawn (wife), Carol (mom), Tara (daughter), Brenna (Tara's friend).Gayle is a geneology buff and, given wireless, was able to research dendritic off-shoots into the past, of our respective ancestral trees.She traced Dawn's paternal line back four generations to Ireland, through census documents mostly. These records contradicted her dad's claim to some elite Aryan heritage, but then her dad \"was a pathological liar\" (or perhaps he was referring to a different [dendrite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite)).Mom's paternal line was harder to trace, but Gayle did manage to pull up Thomas Dewey Reilley's (mom's dad's) draft registration from a database in Montana. He was born in 1898 and grew up to become a linotype operator.Mom was born in 1929 in Chico, California. Her mom's side goes back to Goldens in New Jersey, buried in proximity to Urners it turns out (my dad's paternal line, which traces to [Switzerland](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/whats-urner.html)).[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/reilleydraft.gif)grampa Tom's draft registration, 1918",
