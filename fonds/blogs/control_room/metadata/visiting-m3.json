  "content": "M3 or [#M3 as a hashtag](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/hash-tag-m3.html) (one of many) is a less-used abbreviation for MMM.\u00a0 Putting the 3 as a superscript, designating exponentiation, or atomic number, is more esoteric yet.\u00a0 Multnomah Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends\u00a0is a part of Willamette Quarterly Meeting\u00a0which in turn is within the sphere of North Pacific Yearly Meeting.\n\nThat's as \"high\" as it gets for us. \u00a0NPYM has not yet joined any larger group, such as FGC (Friends General Conference). \u00a0I'd call Pendle Hill a Quaker \"think tank\". \u00a0QUNO and FWCC are more like satellites, though with the latter having a complicated structure of its own e.g. a [Section of the Americas](http://www.fwccamericas.org/).\n\nYes, we jokingly refer to our Quaker Vatican in Philadelphia, but that's more for historical reasons than because of any currently operative administrative lines of control.\n\nThe American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) is its own non-profit, intricately interwoven with the Yearly Meetings through interlocking executive roles and Corporation representatives ([my role](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/03/corporation-meeting.html) in many blog posts), but is not directly \"bossing\" Quakers anywhere unless they're on staff.\u00a0 It's a social action arm, a corporate face for PR and wholesome programming.\n\nAt North Pacific Yearly Meeting we nominate our delegates to these various Quaker organizations, such as Yearly Meeting Appointees (YMAs) to AFSC.\u00a0 That's what I mean by \"Corporation representative\" in that I'd represent AFSC to the world, as one of its Corporation members, but also I'd represent\u00a0[NPYM to AFSC](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/08/alphabet-soup.html).\n\nAn example of an issue for us, during my tenure: \u00a0NPYM is less concerned with \"member\" as a title than some Yearly Meetings, and more concerned with participation.\u00a0 Some of our most active participants, especially in AFSC work, are not officially members of our Religious Society, yet affiliate closely therewith.\n\nSo the AFSC's directive to send \"its most experienced members\" as Corporation members, to Philadelphia for annual meetings, was somewhat problematic in light of Yearly Meeting goals, as sometimes the most enthusiastic participant, most in need of relevant experience (and likely aware of that fact), would be an obvious nominee from our point of view, in addition to perhaps an old timer.\n\nThat was me in earlier chapters, new to AFSC Corporation meetings, though not to Philadelphia.\u00a0 The old chicken:egg conundrum applies:\u00a0 how to get experience when they only want those with experience already. \u00a0By now, as an old timer, I've had enough experience that asking for more seems greedy. \u00a0We have many more up and coming. \u00a0However, there's still plenty of room to participate, without re-upping for past roles.\n\nHow many delegates and who sets the number was another bone of contention. \u00a0AFSC has its own corporate bylaws, but how do these reconcile with Yearly Meetings at the\u00a0Faith & Practice\u00a0level? That's an ongoing discussion. \u00a0During my tenure, NPYM's policy was to pick up the tab on air travel and hotel, or leave it to the delegate to make those costs an in-kind donation. \u00a0Either way, in not making our delegates an expense to AFSC, we were hoping to keep the question of \"how many\" more in our court.\n\nThen there's FCNL:\u00a0 Friends Committee on National Legislation.\u00a0 That entity is based in Washington DC and is all about communicating with legislative bodies i.e. the House and Senate.\u00a0 That's right, it's a lobby.\u00a0 AFSC is more like a government in exile, still in Philadelphia, a city that used to be the nation's capital and remains an important hub in the Quaker State.\n\nWhere the State Department might not see a way clear to hold talks with so-and-so, AFSC might, nevertheless.\u00a0 Quakers make up their own minds in some dimensions, more like Christian Scientists in that way.\n\nThe practice of Quakerism does not dictate uniformity when it comes to viewpoint and some are temperamentally more prone to work \"within the system\" (FCNL's role) whereas others are more interested in challenging the status quo with even more [efficient systems](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/09/quaker-curriculum.html), doing more with less (the term \"dymaxion\" might apply).\n\nLets name the canonical representatives of these extremes of temperament. \u00a0How about \"the law-abiding good doobies\" versus \"the rebels\"? \u00a0Or maybe [\"squares\" versus \"drapes\"](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/cry-baby-movie-review.html) (is slang OK)?\n\nQuakerism caters to the full spectrum, from boat rocker to quietist, as do most religious lineages of longstanding. \u00a0They started out as rebels, subversives in the 1600s, but within a century had come out on top as law-abiding lawmakers, or at least bankers and builders, [pivotal in England's industrialization](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-quaker-arc.html). \n\nQuakerism has been nurtured both by revolutionaries and pillars of the status quo, begetting new synergies in self-organization.\n\nAFSC was established by a Quaker mystic and college professor, [Rufus Jones](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/01/rufus-jones-luminious-life-movie-review.html), among others, and is about doing the work George Fox called \"removing the occasion for wars\" i.e. once those selling the prospect of war have captured the imagination, it's almost too late. \u00a0One needs to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nQuakerism is anticipatory in seeing any attempt to oppress or starve (conquer) a people will lead to blow back and perhaps unforeseen consequences.\u00a0 The opposite of freedom is feeling conquered and under the boot of some cast of authority figures. \u00a0Aren't there better ways to spread knowledge of the tools for good living (tractors and so on)?\n\nWorking \"with the grain\" of the human animal, for its well being, is the way to go if at all possible, as the long haul religions will often attest, corporations too.\u00a0 \"Food not Bombs\" is the basic message.\n\nSo when many Anglos were hell bent on starving the German people, AFSC did its best to [end that blockade](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/04/wanderers-201448-ww1.html).\u00a0 Getting medical supplies to the people of Vietnam suffering aerial bombardment and other atrocities, was a priority in a later chapter.\n\nFriends have filled the ground floor social hall since I started writing this, many of whom I don't recognize, others of whom I do of course.\u00a0 There's Leslie Hickcox, Multnomah Meeting's FCNL representative.\u00a0 We're meeting at Horse Brass later today, across the street from the local AFSC office.\n\nI've been coming to this meetinghouse, off and on since the 1960s, before our family moved to Rome.\u00a0 I also sometimes attend Bridge City Friends Meeting\u00a0(also NPYM), or roam around, not wanting to get too \"stuck in a rut\" as my dad would say.\u00a0 West Hills Friends Church?\u00a0 Why not? Reedwood? \u00a0Sure thing. \u00a0And that's still just within Oregon in under thirty minutes by car, plus I skipped mentioning some worship groups and at least one more Quaker church.\n\nIn terms of role playing, I'm on the NPYM IT Committee these days, as one of its clerks, the one into Technology.\u00a0 They call me the Technology Clerk. \n\nUntil recently one could say with confidence that NPYM was made up of Meetings, Preparative Meetings and Worship Groups, not Churches, Temples, Synagogues or [Mosques](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/08/pilgrimmage.html). \u00a0The latter two seem pretty well branded, as Jewish and Islamic respectively, but then who's to say Quakerism can't spring up within other religions besides [Buddhism](https://flic.kr/p/x6V4vS) and Christianity? \u00a0We might [co-design such sects](http://dogs.thefuntimesguide.com/2010/11/hybrid_dog.php), not just wait for them to happen. \u00a0Hybrids beget exciting new breeds sometimes (i.e. lineages).\n\nYou'll see me wearing that Technology Clerk hat in some of these blog posts as well.\u00a0 My term as NPYM YMA to AFSC ended October of last year (2014). I've been doing Quaker IT for [almost a year now](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profile/KirbyUrner). Yes, it's a rotating position. \u00a0Our brand of Quakers likes to keep [mixing it up](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/07/npym-annual-session-2013.html), a way to fight off the rigor mortis that may attack the more frozenly hierarchical religions.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/21209305201/in/dateposted-public/)",
