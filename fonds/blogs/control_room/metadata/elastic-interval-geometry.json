  "content": "If you've attended my Saturday Academy classes or OSCON presentations, you may have heard me speak about, and possibly [demonstrate](http://www.springie.com/), Elastic Interval Geometry (EIG).Unlike static geometry, EIG unfolds in time according to a precise and deterministic algorithm, but not in any way that's easy to predict short of running the EIG engine -- at least not if the structures are at all complicated.Gerald de Jong was inspired to develop EIG by a [Kenneth Snelson](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/05/barrel-tower.html) sculpture ([this tower](http://www.grunch.net/snelson/)) near his home in Holland.  Later (if I have the chronology right), he turned in to [Bucky's Synergetics](http://www.darwinathome.org/blog/History/2006/05/23/Bucky-Fullers-Synergetics.html), through which he met me, among other afficionados.I still have some Hi8 videotape from the time he flew out for a JavaOne event in the Bay Area, and afterwards stayed with me in Portland.  We drove up to Seattle for a big synergetics pow wow at the viewcrest home of [Russell Chu](http://www.verbchu.com/) and Deb Kasman MD.  [John Braley](http://sunsite.utk.edu/math_archives/.http/hypermail/mathedcc/apr98/0047.html) and [Karl Erickson](http://edu.activeworlds.com/participants/awstruck.html) were among those present -- old timers on my [Synergetics-L](http://web.archive.org/web/20020602143634/inetarena.com/%7Epdx4d/Synergetics-L/) which, along with [Geodesic](http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/archives/geodesic.html), was probably the first synergetics-focused list.Anyway, what triggers this trip down memory lane is the fact that Gerald has recently launched this new [Internet domain](http://www.darwinathome.org/) and [blog](http://www.darwinathome.org/blog/), to serve as a platform for his ongoing explorations of Elastic Interval Geometry (EIG).",
