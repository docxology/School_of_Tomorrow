have recently discovered is the panoply or canvas of minerals one finds goes through a progression, or \"evolution\" if you will, with the implied sub-meaning of \"complexification\" (greater variety, more permutations).\n\nEarly rock from the congealing of the solar system, such as that meteorite that recently [blasted out windows](http://youtu.be/e26A4JHtD54) in Russia (a big topic of our conversation), won't have many minerals in it and half of what it does have is only present in relatively nano amounts.\n\nYou need complex chemical reactions to catalyze a bigger vocabulary, processes like vulcanism and of course the appearance of water.\u00a0 Those things only happen later, on bigger planets (is the current thinking), if at all.\n\nPlanet Earth, at age 4.5 billion or so, may actually be peaking around now, in terms of its mineral variety, as the Sun continues to warm.\u00a0 The breathable future is measured in millions, not billions of years.\u00a0 That may be the standard life cycle then, for planets in our class.\n\nHazen was very sure that humans' contribution to CO2 is like nothing the world has ever seen and is orders of magnitude higher than any second greatest cause of net change.\u00a0 We're pushing fast and hard into unknown territory and he wonders if that's a good idea, though as a scientist he finds it fascinating.\n\nHazen wonders if \"evolution\" might gain more traction as an acceptable topic, in the anti-science USA, if transposed to this scale of minerals.\u00a0 There didn't used to be clays.\u00a0 Evidence is pretty strong that, without bacteria, you don't get specific crystals.\u00a0 Humans are [not the first](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/02/bacteria-aint-dumb.html) biological form to play a role in planetary alchemy.\u00a0 That used to be considered a newfangled idea.\n\nHe was also pretty definite about the story of the Moon.\u00a0 Though he had nothing affirming to say about Velikovsky (someone asked at the dinner) he does of course accept that worlds collide.\u00a0 Earth was not long congealed before this second mass collided with her at an angle and hit the reset button big time.\n\nVenus may have undergone something similar as evidenced by her \"reverse spin\" (did she reel in a moon?) -- it's hard to know much about Venus.\u00a0 Earth's spin nudges our Moon away from us, day by day.\n\nAnyway, besides deterministic processes, you have these stochastic random events, and these will make a huge difference in any given scenario.\n\nIn Hazen's mind, it's pretty clear that \"life\" (however defined) is happening in trillions of cases.\u00a0 His version of Universe is very richly permuted with life forms.\u00a0 Maybe that's why he seemed so enthusiastic about science.\u00a0 He also has a mineral named after him.\u00a0 He was up front about the political nature of nomenclature committees.\u00a0 Some of us were already used to that from tracking Pluto's demotion from planethood.\u00a0 As new information comes in, old mental categories need to be fine tuned.\n\n\"Were buckyballs part of the early crystalline makeup of the universe?\u00a0 Maybe not because buckyballs aren't crystals right?\"\u00a0 That was my question, plus another about whether anthropogenic mineral is an oxymoron.\u00a0 Yes, a buckyball is not a mineral but a lattice of them would be.\u00a0 Early Universe had graphite.\u00a0 Astral buckyballs have already been seen and indeed their spectral signature is what led Kroto to approach Rice University in the first place (this is me thinking out loud now).\n\nRegarding my other question, right, it's not a mineral if made in the lab, that's just part of the concept.\u00a0 That being said, humans have created conditions that have allowed new crystals to spontaneously form.\u00a0 Coal tailings, debris from mines, have been the only known locations for some types of crystal growth pattern.\n\nWe had many young students in the audience and the audience was very encouraging of their coming up with questions, which many did, coming to the microphone.\u00a0 The balcony was filled with sponsored tickets.\u00a0 The Mentor Graphics banner was prominent.\n\nI did some outside work with other Wanderers.\u00a0 The Heathman dinner was spectacular.\u00a0 I asked about the Hamaker-Weaver thesis (glacial dust, re-mineralizing the Earth).\u00a0 Some elements of that were part of Hazen's model, as the carbon cycle is one of his research foci.\n\nCarbon subduction is of major interest.\u00a0 As the Earth cools, it can afford to suck more of its own carbon to lower levels apparently.\u00a0 He and his wife had just visited [Biosphere 2 in Arizona](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/brief-vacation.html) where he had been struck by the scale of some of the experiments, though he thought they might be leaving out some important variables.\u00a0 Live and learn.\u00a0 I bought his book, The Story of Earth.",
