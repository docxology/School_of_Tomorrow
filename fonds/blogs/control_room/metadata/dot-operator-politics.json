  "content": "The \"dot operator\" is ubiquitous in programming, but weren't these languages supposed to extend logic as well as mathematics, in philosophy?\u00a0 Yes, electrons flooded in an animated these new notations from the inside.\u00a0 We had new ways to channel energy, to shape it into computations.\n\nFast forward and it's time to pass the torch to coming generations.\u00a0 However, curricula have bottle-necked and in many cases tanked.\u00a0 I network with my people, as best I can, to come up with something more designed, more attuned to present needs.\u00a0 That means casting the \"dot operator\" as an operator \"within math\".\u00a0 Where the Polyhedrons live.\n\nLast night I wrote [a story on Medium](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/operators-harbingers-of-the-zeitgeist-89fe9f4764b3) recalling the politicization of the math curriculum in the 1920s.\u00a0 Anti-German sentiments were motivating textbook publishers to purge some of the existing Number Theory, according to a reliable source.\u00a0 Looking up to some guy named Gauss wouldn't do.\n\nBarriers to \"Gnu Math\" have been different.\u00a0 There's a wish to keep K-12 mathematics recognizable by not mixing in much code.\u00a0 However, if code does enter the picture, then why not usher in the dot operator of object oriented language fame?\n\nIf we're going to have \"math objects\" we might reach into, through the dot, then why not [have these be polyhedrons](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/03/box-oriented-programming-bop.html)?\u00a0 Cast polyhedrons as the paradigm objects to which \"the dot\" gives us access.\n\nPerhaps the only new idea here is to keep calling it math even after we've automated it to such a degree as to be using electronics i.e. computers.\n\nPatrick and I wandered on Mt. Tabor today, with Quinn the dog.\u00a0 I'm fine with flights of stairs and all that.\u00a0 Patrick has been playing with a certain Kali Linux, \"a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing\".\u00a0 Sounds interesting.\n\nI'd like to be paid to learn stuff I could then turn around and teach in some value-adding manner.\u00a0 That's what an edit-recombine PWS does in the GST ecosystem:\u00a0 it adds value.\n\nMaking polyhedrons the generic object in object oriented programming, in a math curriculum context, is a way to bring more coding skills into the picture, without waiting for CS to pave the way.\n\nThe attempt to boot up CS (computer science) in every high school, as its own track with its own faculty, whereas mathematics is already under pressure to be more relevant, is a mistake we might all learn from.\u00a0 Lets hope South Africa doesn't make the mistake of copying Texas.",
