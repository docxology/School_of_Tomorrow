  "content": ":: attenders ::\n\nFor the most part I think we use \"slate\" the way [most people do](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/slate) as in \"list of candidates\" but we carry it over to mean \"approved cast\" as well.\n\nWhen you get a playbill with a list of players in a show:\u00a0 that's a slate, the way we use the word.\n\nThe other meaning is:\u00a0 \"not yet approved\" as when when Nominating goes to Business Meeting with a \"slate for approval\" (the more mainstream usage).\n\nSo we could say \"unapproved and approved slates\" and be plain (clear) in our meaning.\n\nAs NPYM's technology clerk, I've been [looking at npym_slate](http://www.npym.org/npym-slate) (a web page) to see if we've filled any holes still showing as empty, or if we're showing any ad hoc committees that have since been laid down.\n\nClint has been making changes.\u00a0 This is an \"approved slate\" we're talking about, just sometimes the web-displayed version lags what clerks carry around in their heads.",
