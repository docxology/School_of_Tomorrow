And I don't think because\u00a0of any invisible committee or meritocracy coming to a conscious\u00a0conclusion. Inertia and reflex-conditioning (robotic thinking, AI)\u00a0explains most of what we're up against, in my own sociological\u00a0model of the global university student-faculty.\u00a0We are the hollow menWe are the stuffed menLeaning togetherHeadpiece filled with straw. Alas!For those not on the call, here's a brief synopsis of my talk on\u00a0the modules, with a few grace notes added, for this archived\u00a0version.\u00a0\u00a0Curt let me screen share so that some of the web pages cited\u00a0below were displayed in the course of my \"lightning talk\" as\u00a0we call short\u00a0Show & Tells in Python world (< 5 mins).\u00a0====On pg. 52 of Cosmography, Fuller mentions A, B, T, E and\u00a0S \"modules\".\u00a0 These are names he gives to tetrahedral wedge\u00a0shapes that may be:\u00a0(A) used in the assembly of other shapes (e.g. 24 A modules,\u00a012 left and 12 right, build a regular tetrahedron of volume 1)\u00a0and/or\u00a0(B) treated solely as volume measures (like cups and spoons\u00a0used for liquids)\u00a0For example 24 x 3 = 72 A-modular thimble-fulls of water,\u00a0would precisely fill a volume 3 cube with edges sqrt(2) and\u00a02-R face diagonals inscribing our unit volume tetrahedron\u00a0(where R = IVM ball radius; 4 such balls defining the\u00a0tetrahedron). [0]To actually assemble said cube from the modules (like a\u00a03D jigsaw puzzle vs. just pouring grain or liquid) you'd need\u00a0some B modules as well (same volume, different shape).As & Bs together brick in the cube, rhombic dodecahedron\u00a0and the Coupler. Both A & B have a tetra-volume\u00a0of 1/24.\u00a0Two As (left\u00a0and\u00a0right) plus one B (left\u00a0or\u00a0right) make the\u00a0Mite (minimum tetrahedron), a space-filler of no outward\u00a0handedness (yet left and right may be distinguished in\u00a0dissection).I pointed out this chart (Inchbald, Steel Pillow [1]) and table\u00a0(by Michael Goldberg [2]) showing how the shapes Fuller\u00a0defines and describes in Synergetics in terms of A & B\u00a0modules (e.g. Mite, Rite, Coupler...) already appear\u00a0elsewhere in the mathematical literature, sometimes in\u00a0the context of answering the question \"what tetrahedra fill\u00a0space, and with no need of left and right versions?\" That's\u00a0a question Bucky took up as well.Fuller's focus on space-filling tetrahedrons connects him to\u00a0Sommerville, Hall, Goldberg etc. however Synergetics is\u00a0not the type of book that footnotes / cites all the previous lit\u00a0on a given topic.\u00a0 Nor do mathematicians usually see any\u00a0pressing reason to cite outsider Fuller on these topics and/or\u00a0use his vocabulary, or think in terms of tetra volumes.\u00a0 What\u00a0peer group would reward such behavior?\u00a0 An anthropological\u00a0question.In terms of outreach, these points of contact suggest\u00a0possibilities for the interdisciplinary diplomats among us.\u00a0Michael Goldberg intersects Fuller's research in other\u00a0areas as well, around geodesic sphere classification\u00a0and hexapents (another name for which are \"Goldberg\u00a0polyhedrons\" [3]). E.J. Applewhite got to meet him and\u00a0liked him (\"not a mean bone in his body\" I recall him\u00a0saying), even though citations to Goldberg seem to\u00a0eclipse and occlude links to Bucky e.g. when\u00a0Scientific\u00a0American\u00a0got around to narrating the discovery of the\u00a0virus structure, and left Fuller out of its account, much\u00a0to Bucky's chagrin (I had some access to EJA's archives).Regarding the T & E modules, that's where I fit the \"mind\u00a0the gap\" meme (a meme CJ has been using in a related\u00a0context).\u00a0\u00a0Fuller had been seeking a volume 5 to join his family of volumes\u00a01, 3, 4, 6 and 20, for tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, rhombic\u00a0dodecahedron (RD) and cuboctahedron (VE) respectively (as\u00a0\"flower-arranged\" i.e. \"nested\" in his \"concentric hierarchy\u00a0of polyhedra\").\u00a0\u00a0At first he was attracted to some high frequency idealized\u00a0sphere as his candidate volume 5.\u00a0 But in retrospect, and\u00a0after a\u00a0battle with his\u00a0\"subconscious demon\" [4] he glommed\u00a0on to the rhombic triacontahedron (RT).\u00a0 It would have a\u00a0volume of precisely 5 if its radius were set at 0.9994... i.e.\u00a0just shy of 1; the exact number may be expressed in closed\u00a0form involving surds, notation which Fuller did not eschew,\u00a0even though\u00a0he did not subscribe to current axiomatic\u00a0dogmas regarding the so-called Real Numbers.120 T-mods assemble such an RT5 (30 diamond faces,\u00a0volume 5), whereas 120 E mods assemble an RT5+ of\u00a0radius 1 precisely i.e. the RT5+ \"shrink wraps\" (is precisely\u00a0tangent to) the uni-radius ball of\u00a0 the IVM (= CCP ball\u00a0packing). [5]\u00a0 We need them both.\u00a0 The RT5, scaled up\u00a0by 3/2 to volume 7.5, aligns with RD6 in terms of sharing\u00a0vertices. T-mods have volume 1/24, just like A & B modules.The concentric hierarchy is tight.\u00a0 Compact.\u00a0 Pregnant with\u00a0so many relationships.\u00a0 Worth sharing, even as a purely\u00a0Platonic construct (pre-frequency, pre-time, pre-size, i.e. \"eternal\" in parochial-local synergetics nomenclature).Finally, the S module bricks in the empty space between\u00a0the octahedron of volume 4, and an inscribed, faces-flush\u00a0icosahedron.[6]\u00a0 I took us to a Koski Identities page.[7]\u00a0\u00a0Curt said David is enqueued to given a presentation\u00a0sometime (he's vacationing in the upper peninsula these\u00a0days) and had sent a bunch of materials -- including about\u00a0phi pi (a close approximation of pi based on phi) which,\u00a0of all David's research foci, I myself am not really into\u00a0(I also tend to snub the snubs e.g. snub cube etc.).I emphasized to the group that whereas Fuller endows\u00a0his modules with energy-conserving and dispersing\u00a0properties, and envisions cellular automata type studies\u00a0that could somehow link his modules to CERN style\u00a0particle physics, my own focus is on such low budget\u00a0Platonic stuff, meaning I just stick to the pure geometry\u00a0of it all and don't myself claim to be doing any high energy\u00a0physics around the synergetics modules (I'm no Nassim).\u00a0\u00a0I'm just a double-A battery low powered operation, like a\u00a0wind-up toy bunny.Should we have some breakthroughs in this area (where\u00a0Synergetics meets CERN), that'd be another advance for\u00a0modelability for sure.\u00a0 For me, Tensegrity = Hypertext =\u00a0WWW is already a CERN connection, i.e. the computerization\u00a0of synergetics. [8]Both Snelson and Fuller had high hopes their respective\u00a0models would prove relevant to atomic studies.\u00a0 Snelson\u00a0focused on electrons, whereas Fuller hoped the atomic\u00a0nucleus of transformable protons and neutrons could be\u00a0modeled as closest packed spheres in some way with\u00a0rhombic dodecahedra and his Coupler (8 Mites assembled\u00a0in many different ways -- Chapter 2 discusses the\u00a0permutations) in play.====ENDNOTES:[0]\u00a0 How could a cube of edges sqrt(2) have anything other\u00a0than \"sqrt(2) cubed\" for its volume?\u00a0 My slideshow on\u00a0Fuller's meaning of \"4D\" begins there, by answering that\u00a0question. Just as he challenges us on saying \"up\" and \"down\" instead of \"in\" and \"out\", he would have us question\u00a0our most dogmatic (reflexive) use of \"squared\" and \"cubed\".[1]\u00a0\u00a0[http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/AHD/AHD_Chart.pdf](http://www.steelpillow.com/polyhedra/AHD/AHD_Chart.pdf)\u00a0(Archimedean\u00a0honeycomb duals -- starting at its root with a\u00a0handed half-Mite, what David Koski dubbed a \"smite\").[2]\u00a0\u00a0[https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2021/02/early-bird-special.html](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2021/02/early-bird-special.html)Table is from a 1972 paper i.e. pre the publishing of Synergetics.\u00a0\u00a0[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316574900582](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0097316574900582)[3]\u00a0\u00a0[https://youtu.be/g0RTmVSCsiI](https://youtu.be/g0RTmVSCsiI)[4] \u00a0986.208 \u00a0\"My hindsight wisdom tells me that my subconscious\u00a0\u00a0demon latched tightly onto this 5 and fended off all subconsciously\u00a0challenging intuitions.\" (cite Mistake Mystique -- something CJ harps\u00a0on).More about T & E modules:[https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/01/storyboarding-lcds.html](https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/01/storyboarding-lcds.html)[5]\u00a0 That's another point of contact by the way:\u00a0IVM = CCP = FCC but for minor nuances and connotations.\u00a0Dr. Arthur Loeb was the interdisciplinary diplomat in this\u00a0connection, in both what he taught, and in his prelude to\u00a0Synergetics.[6]\u00a0\u00a0[https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/S_Train.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/S_Train.ipynb)Some of the latest research on the S module.\u00a0 E.g. not in\u00a0Synergetics 1 & 2:\u00a0 S:E == VE:Icosa (same ratio) where\u00a0VE and Icoas are related by Jitterbug i.e. same edge\u00a0lengths.\u00a0S/E as a factor (about 1.08...) takes us to explorations\u00a0of a Jitterbug-like transformation, also in Synergetics,\u00a0wherein the icosa\u00a0inscribed in the octa (faces flush)\u00a0turns into a *smaller* VE, faces flush to the same octa.\u00a0Multiply that VE by (S/E)(S/E) to get the corresponding\u00a0larger icosa's volume.\u00a0 Whereas Icosa * (S/E) --> larger\u00a0VE by Jitterbug.[7]\u00a0\u00a0[https://replit.com/@kurner/SandE-Modules#main.py](https://replit.com/@kurner/SandE-Modules#main.py)(hit green arrow to run the Python, eyeball the source\u00a0code to see the groovy volume expressions for S and E\u00a0modules:\u03c6     = (rt2(5)+1)/2     # golden ratioSmod  = (\u03c6 **-5)/2       # home base SmodEmod  = (rt2(2)/8) * (\u03c6 ** -3) # home base Emod[8]\u00a0\u00a0[http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica6.html](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica6.html)",
