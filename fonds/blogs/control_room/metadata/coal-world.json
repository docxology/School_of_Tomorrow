This was last Saturday.\n\nWe would prefer to export clean energy as we do with that Inter-Tie, DC to LA.\u00a0 We have generators idle a lot of the time, with vast amounts of wind coming on line.\n\nSo where's the real time smart grid we were promised?\u00a0 Is there a Smart Grids for Dummies?\u00a0 Bonneville was pretty much closed down because of the hiring scandal recently.\n\nSpeaking of electrical power, yes those server farms do drink it down.\u00a0 We used to do more aluminum, until Google came along, then also Facebook.\u00a0 The hydropower is plentiful and racks need to be cooled, just as your body needs to radiate to keep you happy in that comfort zone.\n\nElectronics have their comfort zone too.\u00a0 The move to photonics and/or a graphene economy may lower the average temperature, but that remains to be seen.\u00a0 By how much?\u00a0 I'm not posing as some expert.\u00a0 Just another guy with a microphone, asking questions.\n\nFinally, a thought about \"nursing homes\".\u00a0 Let me focus on one of the best ones around here, [Terwilliger Plaza](http://www.terwilligerplaza.com/).\u00a0 Wanderers went there for a party, and recruited new Wanderers from their midst.\u00a0 Doug Strain lived there.\n\nYou could think of it as a university complex.\u00a0 Do you think a 70 year old brain is too old to tackle Erlang, a computer language?\u00a0 What if she or he has already learned some other languages?\n\nWe don't allow ourselves enough opportunities for such experiments.\u00a0 Cruise ships have turned the corner maybe, in harboring intellectuals, but couldn't we do better for our elderly?\n\nMore piped in TED Talks might sound like a small thing.\n\nOr what about in prisons?\u00a0\u00a0 Build your own infrastructure if you have to.\u00a0 Focus on finding better ways forward.\u00a0 That's a sharable mission.\n\nAt San Quentin they studied General Semantics, under the direction of the warden.\u00a0 I met Gene Fowler (poet ex con) through that program, or one like it.\u00a0 He got to hear a Bucky talk.\n\nYou can find missing puzzle pieces if one is at least allowed to look.\u00a0 Give nursing homes more bandwidth and help 'em search for, and find, those marbles they've supposedly lost -- or maybe never had in the first place (says the joker).\n\nFriends care about prison conditions / philosophies and old people.\u00a0 Joe Havens took on \"treatment of the elderly\" as his protest issue, the focus of a hunger strike. \u00a0 We need to up our skill level around taking care of old people, as that's going to be all of us making it to that age, in this lifetime or another (if you'll permit a multiplicity of life stories in your experience, even if only experienced \"vicariously\"). \n\nAnother job for the Chinese Peace Corps: helping Americans get it together to take care of themselves.",
