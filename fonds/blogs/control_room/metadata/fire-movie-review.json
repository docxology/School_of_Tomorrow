The Taj Mahal appears, in the new couple's honeymoon, against an uncharacteristically blue background, more of a postcard, and a metaphor for flawed relationships.\n\nWe're told a story about some deliberate blemish in the Taj structure, exacted by the slave architect, in retaliation for the master's excessive jealousy (he has the architect deliberately debilitated so he won't design a competing Taj down the road -- as if one couple's love was at the expense of all others).\n\nThe love story takes place against a backdrop of tradition and convention, which accepts a lot of cruelty, especially from males.\u00a0 Women in tech encounter these attitudes when seeking self-sufficiency within the political economy.\n\nThe dependence of women, on the social networks of men, is an \"in your face\" aspect of some societies.\u00a0 In others, there's more reciprocity.\u00a0 Sometimes a system will stray from an equilibrium and enter a chaotic phase, which may result in a new equilibrium down the road, some kind of \"plateau\".\n\nThe elder granny character, still able to follow the action, but unable to articulate her thoughts publicly, has a front row seat on a lot of the rule breaking going on.\n\nThe younger wife and protagonist has to put up with a very reluctant husband whose primary love interest is Chinese.\u00a0 The older wife is married to a guy trying to follow the teachings of his swami, but he suffers from overwhelm and occasionally needs mothering.\u00a0\n\nBoth wives see their relationships as emotional dead ends, and yet the two get a lot out of being together.\n\nUnfortunately for the illicit couple, their relationship is occasion for blackmail and counter-threats.\u00a0 A family servant is especially prone to resort to spy-and-tell as a ploy to preserve his situation, after his own illicit addictions have been found out.\n\nMy comment at the end was I'd been overwhelmed by the sound track, which did a lot to create atmosphere, pretty effectively I thought.\u00a0 The music gets very ominous sometimes.\n\nI'll bridge to [the second movie](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/05/the-house-of-tomorrow-movie-review.html) through the Taj, as in Bucky lore, the Montreal 67 dome was a Taj of sorts, dedicated to his own wife, Anne Hewlett, and their relationship.\u00a0 This second movie of the evening was more heteronormative as we say, and more lighthearted.",
