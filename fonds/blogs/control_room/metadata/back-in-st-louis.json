  "content": "I woke up to telecommunications in Campaign Illinois, after seeing [Johnny Rawls Blues Band](http://www.johnnyrawlsblues.com/) at Iron Post, in Urbana, to learn of the devastation in Nepal, a 7.8 earthquake.\n\nLindsey is in the middle of the chaos.\u00a0 She had taken disaster training seriously in Portland, little knowing she would confront disaster in Kathmandu Valley, in the shadow of the Himalayas.\n\nMy Altima Nissan (actually Alamo's) served me well on this trip, a jump into the future from my 1997 maxi taxi, a Maxima.\u00a0\u00a0 Push button start, rear view camera, comfortable and strong.\u00a0 Quite and expensive piece of equipment, and I was relieved to get it back in mint condition, though with 700 plus additional miles to its credit.\n\nI've updated some of the people who know Lindsey, and of her whereabouts, that's she's still alive.\u00a0 Many were not so lucky.",
