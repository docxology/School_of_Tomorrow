  "content": "Some classrooms tell you not to doodle.\u00a0 That may be damaging as right brains think in doodles (a shorthand more than insider neuroscience).\u00a0 As a privileged teen in the Philippines, I was afforded the opportunity to take an Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics workshop.\u00a0 We were encouraged to \"doodle\" by which I mean, to \"organize a structured recall\".\u00a0 Chances are, in a lecture, you'll fall behind if you try to write stuff verbatim.\u00a0 Take a tape recorder?\u00a0 Serial access is slow.\u00a0 Rather:\u00a0 draw semantic networks, connect nodes with edges.\u00a0 Doodle in other words.\n\nThe mathematics teacher on Youtube who has done the most for doodling lately [is Vi Hart](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF7CBA45AEBAD18B8).\u00a0 She mocks a situation all too familiar, a boring background math class with a foreground active mind, one that doodles, muses, connects the dots.\u00a0 At Evelyn Wood, we just called it a \"recall\" for short.\u00a0 After any reading, close the book, close your eyes, then \"do a recall\".\u00a0 These and other techniques I learned were well worth my parents' money.\u00a0 Princeton was a lot easier to keep up with.\n\nAn aspect of doodling is \"drawing monsters\".\u00a0 [Per Monsters University](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/08/monster-university-movie-review.html), I'm not saying monsters can't be endearing.\u00a0 It's just that most of us can't draw very well without really committing to learning, but simple stick figure drawings, or silly-looking stuff, may work out anyway, if you just need comics or cartoons.\n\nI'm not saying political cartoonists are necessarily bad drawers, or pro cartoonists of any type.\u00a0 I'm saying the criteria are such that South Park cartoons are considered effective and appropriate because they to some extent imitate kid drawings and this cartoon features kids.\u00a0 The Beavis and Butthead flavor of edgy cartoons also owes a lot to [Mike Judge](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/07/of-mind-and-body.html). Mad Magazine is not far in the background, with demented cartoons (ala Ren & Stimpy) in the foreground.\n\nPolitical cartoons tend to feature \"caricatures\" which are exaggerated / monstrous renderings designed to communicate more ephemeral attributes of a character's role.\u00a0 These memorable exaggerations get taken up by Francis Yates in her masterful The Art of Memory.\u00a0 Especially in a pre-literate era with no television, large canvases with stunning action are the way to go.\u00a0 Hieronymus Bosch makes an impression.\u00a0 The Mandala is likewise designed to be remembered and carried about in your head.\u00a0 The image is more like a map or a model.\u00a0 It's there to remind you of the \"karmic wheel or wheels\".\n\nAll of which art history should serve as a warning to classroom teachers that instructions to \"close your doodle books\" during a history or literature or math session may be about as counter-productive as it gets.\u00a0 One may call it \"day dreaming\" but that's sometimes just projecting, a fear of not being attended to resulting in a standard classroom practice that actually causes brain damage (or call it \"damage to the learning process\" -- sounds a lot softer).\u00a0 You want day dreaming or reverie sometimes.\u00a0 Knowledge \"seeps in\", requires \"osmosis\".\n\nAt my upcoming workshop, Leveraging Python, I'm going to recommend having doodle books handy; I hope to have some piled up for quick access.\u00a0 They may use their laptops too of course, this being a geek conference where laptops may be open at all times.\u00a0 But I want to transmit some of that Evelyn Wood goodness, even if these are adults.\u00a0 I'm not one of those teachers who thinks it's too late if you're an old dog of some kind.\u00a0 Lets see what kind.\u00a0 Old dogs come in many varieties.\n\nIn freeing more engineers to think in a right brained sense, maybe we'll reap some benefits, such as [better visualizations](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/boosting-bandwidth.html), stronger metaphors, more efficient learning techniques.\u00a0 Cyberia (cyberspace) is cram-packed with various \"creatures\".\u00a0 We acknowledge \"viruses\" but then what should we call software running normally?\u00a0 \"Daemons, processes...\" we have a few words, a few images.\u00a0 But the cartoons are still gruel-thin at the moment.\u00a0 What Cyberia needs are more doodlers.",
