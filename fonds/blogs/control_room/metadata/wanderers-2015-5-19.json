I kept harping on that, like a mantra.\n\nI was touting the standard [Garden of Eden in a Climatron](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/04/garden-of-eden.html) stuff, a kind of utopianism associated with Whole Earth Catalog if anyone remembers those.\u00a0 The Bucky stuff, I call it.\n\nStewart Brand had a hand in this stuff, and so did J. Baldwin.\u00a0 Stewart pushed to get pictures of the whole Earth, as in \"from-space photography\" into the public domain.\n\nShots from space (ET PoVs) were entirely new in those early days of the first orbiting satellites, ala Sputnik et al.\n\nI started my hour-long presentation with two misanthropic cartoons, pulled from my Facebook profile, then flipped through slides from the Martian Math class.\n\nThe Martian Math stuff was portrayed as 10-20 years ahead of the pack.\u00a0 I was purposely somewhat Cabalistic or cliquish one might say, in implying Silicon Forest was moving ZomeTool, as implied by a picture from our [field trip to ONAMI](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/11/onami-tour.html), as a part of some cultic process.\u00a0 We talked about Grunch a lot (Fuller's coin), and [Ed Applewhite's](http://grunch.net/archives/171) Cosmic Fishing.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nPeople were quite engaged and full of insights and questions, as I'd hoped.\u00a0 We talked about dedicated freeways with self-driving trucks -- but don't we have those already?\u00a0 They're called trains and only one of the cars, called the engine, needs to drive (the trucks would need some kind of supervision too).\n\nAlthough I was walking them through some slides, the idea was to inspire conversation.\u00a0 We were there to think about Futurism as a discipline, and about how Science Fiction works, as [distopian-to-utopian](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/interest-group.html).\u00a0 I mentioned the Paul Allen museum on the subject, in nearby Seattle.\n\nThe ratio of science to fiction matters.\u00a0 That's on one of the slides.\n\nAnd also:\u00a0 is it about humans expanding elsewhere, or being expanded upon, as in invaded?\u00a0 A little of both maybe?\u00a0 I talked about \"angels and devils\" as the old days ETs.\n\nRegrets poured in from some of the people Don had invited (that's his role) but who couldn't make it and maybe wanted to be polite and all, but as you can see from the picture (above), it's a small room.\n\nThanks for thinking of me, and lets get together soon!\u00a0 Life is short.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/17160510029)\n\nTrevor in character at Mother Foucault's",
