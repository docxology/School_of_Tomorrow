  "content": "I chauffeured Carol [to PDX](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2899624515/) this morning, having taken her out to dinner last night, at a local folks eatery (nothing too fancy).A familiar sight in the halls of power, pushing her \"[congress coaster](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2962186873/in/photostream/)\" and [peacemaker agenda](http://disarm.wilpf.org/), she's anxious about making it to all sixty four senate offices, representatives of those states from which she has signatures, on [a petition against weapons in space](http://www.wilpf.org/PAROSPetition).So far, the \"[don't-know-why](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html)\" politicos have tended to cave to the manifest destiny crowd, a  [small authoritarian minority](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/on-individualism-transcendentalism.html) that believes in rule by brute force and yet feels entitled to pontificate about \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" -- sounding [rather idiotic](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/04/idiocracy-movie-review.html) when so doing.Then it's on to Geneva.En route to the airport, we discussed how expat Americans who've spent time in Africa, [such as herself](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2766688032/), might be considered African American from a [memetic point of view](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/hotel-rwanda-movie-review.html) (talking about memes).But of course many folks are fixated on genes over memes, DNA having been only recently discovered, whereas [the concept of \"race\"](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/terms.html#race) is rather older, more tired, often confused with the anthropologists' concept of \"ethnicity\".",
