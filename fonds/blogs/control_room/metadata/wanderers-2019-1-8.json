We're named Wanderers because we sometimes practice Open Forum, which means the conversation is allowed to wander, in a kind of Bohmian dialog, and takes on Ouija-board like qualities.\n\nEspecially if we have a critical mass, which I won't call\u00a0 quorum as we're not following Robert's Rules or anything like that.\u00a0 The Quaker practice of consensus is just beneath the surface.\u00a0 We're not doing business, usually, so it's closer to Meeting for Worship.\n\nHowever, tonight some business came up, as the estate / campus is under some pressure to do its nonprofit business of memorializing Linus Pauling and his contribution to humankind.\u00a0 He received a Nobel Peace Prize among other prizes.\n\nHis wife Ava Helen was active in WILPF (Womens International League for Peace and Freedom).\n\nSpeaking of WILPF, my mother has been a long time WILPF activist, even went to the The Hague for its centennial.\u00a0 Today she got some copies of Western Friend, January - February 2019, the On Weapons issue.\u00a0 She has an interview published in this issue.\u00a0 She's what we call a weighty Friend.\n\nSpeaking of weighty Friends, I'm back on beer as it's 2019.\u00a0 Glenn just phoned to say Wanderers was finished and I could join the after party at his place.\n\nAnyway, very public talks about ISEPP and the Pauling House, with \"strangers\" (members of the public) present, is very much in accordance with the spirit of nonprofit management.\u00a0 We're servants of the public, not shareholders.\u00a0 As a socially responsible form of capitalism, we compete with the non-profits who set up around cost plus military contracts.\n\nSpeaking of government, Don came by early from the hospital to watch the president's speech on the telly.\u00a0 We went through CBS.\u00a0 President Trump was about done when Don arrived.\u00a0 Then we heard the rebuttle from the other party.\u00a0 Don visited with Carol a bit and then gave me a lift to the venue.\u00a0 I took some time over at Fred Meyer's to tweet, on [@4DsolutionsPDX](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/1082832040137961472), one of my channels.",
