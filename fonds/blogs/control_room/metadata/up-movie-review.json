  "content": "[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3895110783/)Up is about the puer-senex combo, to use [Jungian parlance](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/with-friends-of-jung.html).  The pair embarks on a classic quest, in a spirit of adventure shared by an off camera mother figure.The villain is just trying to prove his authenticity (at the expense of harming an endangered species -- so unacceptable) and has surrounded himself with talking dogs in that effort (it's a cartoon, and Disney knows how to animate dogs).I saw this as a double feature with Groundhog Day (later, back at my place) so that may color my thinking (deja vu is a theme).The \"little mail man\" (pun) [looks like Humpty Dumpty](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/12/some-youtube-r.html) and brightens the picture right from the start, turning a potentially bitter old man story into an heroic epic instead.  Uplifting.",
