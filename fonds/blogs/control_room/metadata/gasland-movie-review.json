  "content": "John Fox is worried about what it might mean to allow hydrofracturing in his water table.  Would toxins get into the ground water and destroy his habitat?  Hydrofracturing is a process of injecting a brew of chemicals deep into the earth to release natural gases.  \n\nA complicated and unknown geology may offer little protection against seepage.  Wells get contaminated and the the tap water catches fire.  Streams go bad.  Toxins trickle in (or flood in as the case may be).  Animals (including humans) get sick and die.\n\nJohn makes a pilgrimage across country, starting and ending in Pennsylvania, aiming to discover what's been going on.  Colorado, Texas, Wyoming, Utah... [Louisiana](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/10/necessary-ruin-movie-review.html).\n\nAre the denizens of [the Lower48](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/wanderers-2009217.html) still hell bent on destroying their own environment.  Yes, apparently they are.  Environmental protections put in place by a previous generation have been rolled back, as [unfavorable to industry](http://www.oilandgaslawyerblog.com/2011/02/hydraulic-fracturing-makes-the.html).\n\nThe largest unfiltered water supply in the world in upstate New York is the next target.  People worry about \"terrorists\" poisoning their water supply. Ironic.\n\nLots of people enjoy natural gas though.  Big city folk use it to cook with, heat their buildings with, power their \"clean energy\" buses with.  Gotta have it.\n\nWhat's happening to the countryside is a lot like what's happening to the [Niger Delta](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/05/more-screenings.html) or any region where rampant energy extraction occurs without much rhyme or reason. The locals are no match for the conquerors, who bully them into subjugation.  There's little government to speak of, and no real national guard (in the literal sense, of guarding the people).\n\nOne might imagine ways to actually plan and develop energy resources in harmony with the ecosystem, intelligent designs.  Such planning is [hardly evident](http://www.landmanreportcard.com/) in the Lower48 though.  \n\nAny real science is short circuited as politicians try to create \"jobs jobs jobs\" (opportunities to \"[earn a living](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/11/gnu-world-order.html)\") regardless of the consequences.\n\nUpdate (September 2017):\u00a0 see this as a double feature with FrackNation for another point of view.\u00a0 There's also a Gasland 2 out by now.",
