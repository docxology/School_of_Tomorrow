  "content": "I borrowed this DVD from Glenn several days ago.\u00a0 As it wasn't a rental, it went to the back of the queue.\u00a0 I'd not realized [Werner Herzog](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/01/aguirre-wrath-of-god-movie-review.html) was the director, a pleasant surprise.\u00a0 He's a masterful filmmaker, and narrator (storyteller).\n\nThe film doesn't beat around the bush about what happened to Timothy and his friend Anne, more mysterious, as to why she stayed.\u00a0 She wasn't as suicidal around bears as Timothy, who tempted fate for a living.\n\nThe angle Herzog picks up on is not Timothy's controversial lifestyle (waltzing with bears), but his talents and technique as a filmmaker.\u00a0 Herzog treats him respectfully as a peer.\n\nIn showing the many takes of the same scene, one might mock or denigrate a brave soul.\u00a0 As a fellow director and filmmaker, Werner leads a lay audience to water, and some really beautiful music (the DVD comes with a full length feature on scoring the audio track, thumbs up).\n\nGiven almost eight billion people, and bears a true rarity, in relative terms, having at least one man daffy and lonely enough to go trans in this way, is a statistical possibility (as we see).\n\nThe locals, who've been keeping track for thousands of years, understand that taboos are for a reason.\u00a0 Tempting a fate is a great way to someday meet said fate.\u00a0 Treadwell is saying \"bring it on\" to this Bear World.\n\nHis life turns into a grim tale and sends a warning to children, but without a retraction of the loving attitude.\u00a0 We're free to love foxes and guard their habitat.\u00a0 Whether that means chasing them or sleeping with them is another matter.\n\nDomestication has worked with some species.\u00a0 Humans have found some understanding with other wild creatures.\u00a0 These relationships are not static.\u00a0 We could do more to cultivate our relationships with fellow travelers.\u00a0 Religions have their work cut out, not just the sciences.\n\nWerner is contrasting a hippie clown aspect with a more serious cowboy, in sampling the many talking heads from Timothy's scenario.\u00a0 Treadwell was part of an ecosystem in the human world just as surely, with children a big part of it.\n\nIn watching Herzog's sampling of Treadwell's unedited hundred or more hours, I was grateful for the deep dive into a loner's life, and struck by the young age of the intended audience.\u00a0 Timothy was creating raw material for documentaries he'd share with children.\n\nIn meeting his fate so fatefully, he upped the rating, from G to something closer to R.\u00a0 Herzog wisely keeps us from having to relive the full ordeal, but does manage to communicate horror.\u00a0 The grizzly story turns grisly.\u00a0 And children still love the foxes and bears -- except the mean ones.\n\nMom & dad and my sis went to a private farm north of Lesotho where the caretaker developer allowed lion cubs to roam freely, including among the guests.\u00a0 He'd cage them or move them out when old enough to do serious damage.\n\nMom doesn't know how that scenario turned out.\u00a0 Carol, Julie and Jack only briefly overlapped it.\u00a0 A lion cub jumped up on their table, in their presence, knocking it over, and ate their tuna fish sandwiches.\u00a0 That's what tourists were paying for I guess.",
