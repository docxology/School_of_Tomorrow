However that doesn't mean the frames are haphazard. \u00a0She's extremely meticulous.\n\nHer style reminds me of both Iron Ministry and Songs from the North.\n\nI arrived late to Wanderers as a consequence of finishing this week's viewing homework.\n\nThe conversation was truly wandering, with lots of chatter about crypto-currencies.\n\nHowever the main theme was again gemstones, thanks to Steve Mastin (who brought some), with Glenn Stockton chiming in.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/28334463242/in/dateposted-public/)",
