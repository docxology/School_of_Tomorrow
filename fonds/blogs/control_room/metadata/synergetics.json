That's heresy per some dogmas.\n\nI got a message something along those lines from a lecture by Nobel Prize winning Dr. Robert Laughlin, wherein he talked about upsetting the apple cart at different levels.\u00a0\n\nExtrapolating: it's not like the gears are locked so tightly that we have to wait for heaven and earth to move before we experience breakthroughs at some intermediate level, i.e. even when levels above and below seem relatively unperturbed.\u00a0\n\nOn some frequency on the radio dial, a plot twists, not disturbing other programming, yet awakening those who've tuned in. \n\nStorms may be confined, but not rendered unreal.
