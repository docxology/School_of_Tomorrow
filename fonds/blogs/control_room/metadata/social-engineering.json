My sister lived there for some years.\n\nSpeaking of teaching, I want to introduce high schoolers to Regexes, and not just inside the domain of \"computer science\".\u00a0 We're always reminded that Regular Expressions were invented by a mathematician. Lets expand high school math to include them.\u00a0 What's on my plate for the next couple days.\n\nSo the social engineering centers around weather reports, as broadcast over TV stations.\u00a0 Some of the GPS / GIS maps in the background are fairly TexMex in their makeup, i.e. we're in some Middle America between Mexico City and Las Vegas.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThere's a road net, a set of mountain ranges, some valleys with rivers.\u00a0 The Colorado, for example, no longer has much of a delta to speak of.\u00a0 Humans have diverted 100% of that particular river.\u00a0 I'm getting off topic w/r to TV weather, but not w/r to global climate.\n\nWhen TV viewer-voyeurs are as familiar with Middle Americas as with so-called New England, they'll be less prone to fuel the polarizing language factions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAgain, the Americas are in love with themselves.\u00a0 We have so much to treasure.\u00a0 We are the real West after all (plenty wild), not the pseudo-west of the Atlantic-bounded EU East.\n\nWeather maps, as you've noticed, are used to promote a sense of cohesion, of us versus them. That's why you still see these ludicrous masking algorithms, wherein the \"weather of interest\" is miraculously masked out.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs if political boundaries trumped nature.\u00a0 Hilarious right?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe get more serious around airports, acknowledging there's an ecosphere (aka a biosphere).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nFor the most part, though, we're living (mentally) in a house divided, some us versus them.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat's your model?\u00a0 Question authority.\n\nPicture a weather map that strays from Oregon to Washington to Vancouver without a pause.\u00a0 Bellingham is the belly button of this Cascadia place.\u00a0 Do we need permission from the District to frame our weather reports as such?\u00a0 Of course not.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe might obey conventions out of reflex of course.\u00a0 \"Lets do what we've always done!\" is the slogan of Darwin Award champions.",
