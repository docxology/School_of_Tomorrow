Tabor.\n\nNot so.\u00a0 The old hospital campus no longer exits but think \"food carts near Jolly Roger\" on 12th to get closer.\u00a0 Think Washington High School (where Pauling went), already retired from public school service in my day, and [used by artists](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-love-song-of-rbf-movie-review.html).\n\nAnyway, I finally met a guy from there, the seminary, just here for two weeks to finish up some doctorate of divinity studies.\u00a0 He's based in Texas and his family gets antsy when he travels.\u00a0 I understand.\u00a0 If the family might go too... I was thinking of Brazil with my daughters...\u00a0 Not everyone enjoys having their cage rattled the way traveling does do.\n\nHe was already very experienced as a world traveler, doing childrens relief work.\u00a0 We agreed that Austin is like a bridge city between Portland and the rest of Texas.\u00a0 Everyone seems to think that.\u00a0 [Topology is weird](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150113-a-proof-that-some-spaces-cant-be-cut/).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/16311187092)",
