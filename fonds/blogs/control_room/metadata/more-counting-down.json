The Portland office has relinquished its hold on [its historic digs](https://flic.kr/p/7dHjH1) on E Burnside, though the outdoor sign is still there.\n\nWhere to go next, that's fully ADA compliant?\u00a0 Old houses like that one usually don't even begin to qualify. \u00a0E Burnside has a ramp, with some turning radius in the restroom but I don't have the exact figures.\u00a0 I'm suggesting we camp out, at least on billboards:\u00a0 picture an AFSC tent overlooking a grand canyon (doesn't have to be the famous one):\u00a0 \"Really Out There, and Lovin' It!\" could be the slogan (would [McDonalds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s_advertising) sue?).\n\nThe idea is like we're into scouting and stuff. \u00a0Like the old days in some ways, when AFSC ran work camps for COs.\u00a0 The idea of a recruiting tent right [in R2DToo](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/06/right-to-dream-too.html) itself has some appeal.\u00a0 AFSC has a long history of working with stateless / houseless / refugee populations.\n\n:: [source](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/04/right-to-dream-too.html) ::",
