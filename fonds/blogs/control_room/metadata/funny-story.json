  "content": "Ever preparing to fight the last civil war, the American generals girded themselves.  Katrina hit first, which didn't count, because she's Mother Nature, and Mother Nature always wins.Back on the ground, what happened next surprised people:  the West Coast declared war on the East Coast, and the latter capitulated immediately, sparing us any unsightly bloodshed.And once again, the USA generals were caught unprepared.The moral of this tale:  war is always surprising.",
