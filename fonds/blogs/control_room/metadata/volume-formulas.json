A lot of [my tetravolume computations](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/Computing%20Volumes.ipynb) come from there.\u00a0 Just today I was doing these:\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/45586281061/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nKoski is on the other end of the line doing some work around the S-factor.\u00a0 He fed me another test to try, which came out as expected.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/44695079795/in/dateposted-public/)",
