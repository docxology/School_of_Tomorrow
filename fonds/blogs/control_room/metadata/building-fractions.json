  "content": "The code below shows a way of teaching operator overloading in Python.\n\nEven\n though the standard library includes a Fraction type, it can't hurt to \nrecreate it in a lesson, drawing on our knowledge of how fractions \nshould behave.\n\nNotice the embedded _gcd() method \nemploys Euclid's Method to reduce fractions to lowest terms on \ninitialization.\u00a0 Since multiply and add operations, and their inverses, \nall end up creating new Q type instances (fractions), no attempt at \nreducing is made until then.\n\nHit the Run button to run the script.\u00a0 Output appears at the bottom.",
