  "content": "Michael Moore has been following Flint, Michigan through all of his movies.\u00a0 It's the saga of a city gone bust, amidst rulers who don't have much hope, given the priorities of their higher ups.\n\nThe timeline Moore follows starts with the 2016 US election, then jumps over to Michigan in 2010, when the state governor invokes emergency powers in several cities and replaces their local leadership with his people.\n\nAround Flint, the engineering goes south when a working water supply gets monkeyed with.\n\nTelevision did not turn out to be that medium for public debate we used to hear about, given who paid for it and why.\u00a0 Will social media be any better?\u00a0 There's a quick cut to Facebook, suggesting grassroots organizing but the internet and cryptocurrencies are not the order of the day (Alex Jones makes it in, but I was confused about what he was saying in that clip).\n\nMostly the tech giants get left out of this telling, and there's no attempt to dive deep into hackerdom. Leave Putin another bad guy strongman, the way Trump likes his leaders, and move on.\u00a0 This isn't Oliver Stone driving.\n\nAnyway it's jarring when we remember this lead poisoning is all happening during President Obama's time, the last great hope.\n\nThe Trump presidency is already well established in the movie before we switch to Flint, which is deliberate, as the story is one of \"paving the way\".\n\nThe larger picture is pretty bleak.\u00a0 Young people need to do their own organizing, and are.\u00a0 The adults aren't particularly able, when it comes to keeping democracy going.\n\nOne of the wise elders reminds us the US only started to experiment with democracy in the 1970s, with on-paper enfranchisement of non-whites and women, and that experiment may have reached its conclusion, in the wake of 911.\n\nThe flavor of the film is wistful.\u00a0 Wouldn't a United States be a good idea?\n\nFilmmaker Steve Bannon says on camera he appreciates Michael Moore's craft, though is at odds with his politics.\n\nIt's not Moore's fault that destiny would put him in the eye of the storm, nor Flint's either.\u00a0 He has already looked at school shootings.\u00a0 He's trusted to observe the high schoolers in action.\n\nSure he's heavy handed, because he's expressing his worries in strong terms.\u00a0 He says out loud what a lot of people are thinking.\u00a0 Lets get those thoughts on the big screen.\u00a0 Yep, there's Hitler, buoyed by some of the same vibes; his ghost still haunts us.\n\nThe school teachers of West Virginia get a lot of recognition, for trying to hold together the fabric of their society in the midst of an opium crisis and infrastructure bled dry.\n\nThe Bernie Sanders campaign, and its call for social programs, gets a lot of focus as well.\n\nMoore is weaving a lot in.\u00a0 He's curating many \"Kodak moments\" assuming an audience in the future.\n\nI'm not saying I'm Moore's mouthpiece and would tell all the same stories he does.\u00a0 We're on rather different trajectories.\u00a0 That's not a criticism, just an observation bordering on a truism.\n\nHere's another provocative film that is sure to provoke many.\u00a0 I felt updated on many happenings.",
