  "content": "At first I didn't like that the timer was running even if I'd not signaled my willingness to begin, by punching the green flag.\u00a0 I'd have the option to turn that off, given the See Inside powers conferred in a copyleft economy.\u00a0 I didn't write this game, merely remixed it and value added.\n\nThe point is to keep going to the next level, by setting off chain reactions that consume tiny sprites. The surface area of the target area is variable and rises as more sprites are consumed, before falling again. You anchor the target initially and then sit back to see if you've won the round, so it's basically a one click per round game, a feature, a kind of minimalism.\n\nNote the timer resets on each explosion. The sprites are all clones of the main ball, which spawns multiple copies of itself, shrunk to 15% of original size.\u00a0 The number spawned is three more than the level number.\u00a0 Notice you have less time as the level number rises.\u00a0 But then more explosions per time unit would be expected.\n\nAll in all, I consider this a handsome little game, elegantly implemented.\u00a0 I'll plan to show and tell about in at summer camp today.\u00a0 I actually found it in the official handbook, so it's not like I'm straying far from my ken.",
