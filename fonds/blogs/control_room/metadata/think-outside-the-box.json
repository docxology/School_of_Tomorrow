  "content": "Those of us working in the neighborhood of Common Core and STEAM (STEM + Anthro, or Art in most accounts), might appreciate \"outside the box\" as a fine meme to build on.\n\nHow?\n\nWhat do you picture when you picture a box?\n\nNo doubt a rectilinear affair no?\u00a0 Not a tetrahedron certainly.\u00a0 But why not?\n\nThe tetrahedron is the paradigm container, with minimal edges and faces.\n\nForget practicality, think about conceptuality.\n\nWe'll get back to practicality, with the same Cube in a spanking new context.\n\nWe might spin it as \"break free from the box\" in the sense of the box's shape.\u00a0\n\nWe're free of our stereotype of \"a box\".\u00a0 The blinders have come off.\n\nWhat difference does it make, to be free of the \"box shape\"?\u00a0 Think about it.",
