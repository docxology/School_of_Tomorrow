Chu.\u00a0 E.J. Applewhite followed me out to the sidewalk, curious to overhear what conversation might be important enough to take me out of this synchronous opportunity.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOverhearing my side, he assumed my wife and I were talking about a servant.\u00a0 We were actually talking about a dog.\u00a0 My wife was in an awkward situation, having taken Sarah (our mutt) to a Quaker gathering, a camp, where said dog was not on her best behavior, or such is my recollection.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI was amused Ed was thinking that (that I had a servant), or pretended to, and that he got me telling the truth in short order.\u00a0 SNEC = Synergeticists of the Northeast Corridor, an acronym since jettisoned.\n\nNext, I'm going to hop on Protonmail and write about Dark Horse comics (not as a know-it-all mind you, more as a know-nothing).\u00a0 I'll be overlapping with the TrimTabbers, who were meeting about Applewhite's Cosmic Fishing this morning.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat was one of my synchronous opportunities.\u00a0 This will be another way of jumping in on that thread, asynchronously.",
