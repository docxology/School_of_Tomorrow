Like they said in the est Training, when it comes to purpose, just think of always going further west.\u00a0 Don't ask why; it's a metaphor.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe therefore send out scouts to find the most promising next trails.\u00a0 They report back.\u00a0 We have a meeting to establish consensus.\u00a0 Sometimes, a wandering band will branch or fork, depending on longer term objectives.\n\nThe Left is the perpetually scouting phase, where some come back with reports of dire dangers, awesome wonders, or don't come back at all.\u00a0 That's where the sense of entropy comes from.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCasting one's nets forward in time yields a mixed bag, and it's up to the campers to assemble the incoming info, the feedback, in ways that advantage them.\u00a0 In other words, the curators conserve and build traditions, a fancy name for habits.\u00a0 Programs.\u00a0 Engrams.\u00a0 \n\nTraditionalists conserve artifacts and memories.\u00a0 In Bayesian terms, they represent collective \"priors\" i.e. the current sense of things based on experiences to date.\u00a0 Quakers might think in terms of Meetings for Business.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe call them \"on the Right\" because they're the orthodoxy, the accumulated wisdom of the ages.\u00a0 In theory that is.\n\nThose on the Left may feature a lot of younger and bolder personality types, who with age become slower to jump into the action pell-mell.\u00a0 The older Right oft times empathizes with the younger whippersnappers who remind them of themselves, closer to the start of whatever careers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYes, this template or boilerplate is the basis of stereotype type casting.\u00a0 You'll find many a story line featuring \"the wizened activist\".\n\nSo that's my proposed spectrum:\u00a0 \"Curators\" (on the right) versus \"Experimentalists\" (on the left).\u00a0 Or shall we say \"Base Campers\" versus \"Scouts\"?\n\nI'd say let me know what you think in the comments, however the model here is that of \"a Quaker journal\" and so no \"comments\" are expected.\u00a0 However off site commentary is always welcome.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat do Left and Right mean to you?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDoes the axis I've described make any sense as an organizing polarity?",
