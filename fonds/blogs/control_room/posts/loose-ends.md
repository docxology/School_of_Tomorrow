Regarding that [shower drain](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/11/revamping-remedial-math.html), I did end up asking Dex ("[dex knows](http://www.roadsidepeek.com/roadusa/southwest/arizona/azsign/azothersign/index3.htm)")  for a professional plumber, went with [Rescue Rooter](http://portland.citysearch.com/profile/8437144) with its multi-page ad.At first he described it as a nightmare job, as both the shower and tub drain to the same T, meaning he'd need to make a 90 degree turn into the T's bottom -- a difficult maneuver for his power snake.But then he realized the bathroom sink also drains to the same pipe, lower down but still above the likely clotting point.  This became his point of access.I wondered if "scare then relief" was a typical [rollercoaster](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/tragedy-in-west-virginia.html) before closing the deal -- the customer is just glad it'll be easy / routine and signs gratefully.No, it's not quite like balloon angioplasty, but there are some analogies, especially from a [Monster House](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/monster-house-movie-review.html) perspective.I felt OK about shelling out the $167, as it was obvious to me that my skillset and toolset just weren't up to the job i.e. I wasn't being redundant (sometimes another form of irrelevant -- not always though).As for [that paint job](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/merging-traffic-patterns.html), they said they'd come back for a couple loose ends I might find, plus put another coat of weather proofing on the front door.  I said I'd gladly pay 'em then but then went up to Hawthorne.  By the time I'd come back, the check had been cut.  I blame myself for not communicating more clearly with my wife.One of the guys was a former Navy submarine divemaster and I got into sharing about [my ](http://beneaththesurface.biz/)uncle's new book, now with a US-based publisher.  Another member of the team, I think the company president, fell off a ladder at another site and hurt his hand really badly meaning time in the ER.I hope he's OK by now.  I liked their energy and the house looks great -- they did a good job for the price I paid.  I'd recommend 'em to others.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/bluehouse.jpg)[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/rmt.1.jpg)
