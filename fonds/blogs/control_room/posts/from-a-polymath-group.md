I
 know in my case, the A in STEAM stands for Anthropology, the study of 
Humans, very encompassing, Art a tiny subset. 

I use the A to intersect 
with PATH: Philosophy, Anthropology (right here!), Theater, History. 

Yes, Theater (includes politics) and History (what's been happening) 
shmoo together with the others, but then lets not pretend STEM -- let 
alone STEAM -- isn't all shmooed together too. 

Put it all in a blender 
for a Universe, to drink and forget.
