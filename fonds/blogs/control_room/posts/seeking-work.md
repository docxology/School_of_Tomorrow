I missed Wanderers yesterday, was grateful to sit in with the physical therapist, in the aftermath of Tara's encounter with a reckless driver.

My heart goes out to families who came to this juncture and lost a dear member, or suffered severe injuries.  I lost my dad in a car accident, almost lost my mom.

Glenn reports [Sheldon Renan](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/wanderers-2009610.html) was just back from Brussels, all hot to trot, optimistic about Portland's future.

That "capital of open source" moniker has not lost its luster after all these years.  The world expects great things from our city, or at least that's the buzz in some circles.

I supplied BFI's web site with two new community postings earlier today, [one about Flextegrity](http://bfi.org/our_programs/bfi_community/lattices/lattices/flextegrity), which I'm hoping to use as a classroom supply in measured quantities, another [about Martian Math](http://bfi.org/our_programs/bfi_community/synergetics/synergetics/martian_math), which repackages a lot of the Bucky stuff.

My analysis for Glenn this morning, after flipping through some art books in his collection, is that insecurity on the part of conservatives accounts for much of the hold up.

I found [Haim's analysis](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/11/increasing-military-iq.html) rather telling.  He's worried we're trying to turn back the clock and make sacred geometry and divination our whole kit and kaboodle, a surrender to superstition and hard won advances in science.

At any rate, whether he realizes it or not, whether he intends it or not, and certainly with no malice aforethought, Kirby is trying to repeal the Renaissance and to erase two thousand years of intellectual development in the mathematical sciences. Other than that, it's a great program.
Arthur Loeb maybe expresses some similar sentiments in his introduction to Synergetics:

Platonic and Archimedean solids and such plane figures as the Pentagram were powerful tools of Applied Magic. The Age of Reason banished such configurations to the realm of superstition: their power was denied. Orthogonality prevailed, being rational and very earthbound. Interest in geometrics declined. Buckminster Fuller's search for a natural and truly rational coordinate system eventually led to the tensegrity concept and the construction of geodesic domes. Polyhedra and pentagrams, being proven useful after all, have been rescued from the limbo of superstition. Now the danger exists that geometrics will become respectable once more, and it behooves us to take a good look at the very unorthodox peregrinations of Fuller's mind before stepping into the inviting straitjacket.
My view is we don't turn our backs on history and we accept the connections between art, mathematics, and psychology as part of our shared heritage.

Our emphasis, however, is on promising careers.  This isn't about churning out a vast army of astrologers and soothsayers, unless by that you simply mean wise investors with long term, not just short term horizons, readers of tea leaves. People like that always sound at least a little bit cosmic.

Rather than resist all attempts to paint Synergetics as "occult" I go along with these comic book motifs as good marketing and point to Portland's techno-occult as a source of many positive memes.

Bucky always considered the art world a source of key allies.  Paul Laffoley, our special guest at Esozone, is a representative of that bridge twixt esoterica and American Transcendentalism ala Fuller.

My thanks to Suzanne Bader of Mosaic Consulting for swinging by Lyrik to check in.  I was happy to report on Gordon's improving health.

Next, a meeting with Amy, the insurance adjustor.
