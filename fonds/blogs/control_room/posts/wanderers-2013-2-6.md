Â Steve Mastin delivered a detailed yet sweeping account of the history of diabetes, especially its diagnosis (e.g. Benedict Reagent, Clinistix, glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c etc).

Type 1 diabetes is more of an autoimmune disease whereas Type 2 results from a combination of susceptibility (increasing in the population) and environmental factors, such as diet and obesity. 

Steve has worked in the field, including with Japanese ministries post WW2, when the switch to new eating habits triggered a diabetes epidemic.

We went off on numerous tangents (per Wanderers) as Steve knew some of the players personally and wanted to give a sense of them, [Richard T. Jones](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/news_events/news/2008/012308-richard-jones-building.cfm) (OHSU) for example. 

Attendance was high, including David Feinstein, Dick Pugh, Dave DiNucci, Michael Hagmeier and several others.
