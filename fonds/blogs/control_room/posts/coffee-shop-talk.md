Wanderers was open agenda this morning, and we were blessed with a world traveling couple, friends of [Milt's](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/wanderers-2006830.html), freelancers attracted by Portland's cosmopolitan kulture, and with a lot of combined and individual experience in organizational development.Our conversation veered through the [Khyber Pass](http://www.rtfract.com/khyber.htm), from Pakistan to Afghanistan, to [Ken Wilber](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/posting-via-modem.html), to Lesotho, to South Africa ([protea](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=protea) in particular), to Cape Town, where it turned out we'd overlapped as attenders at the 1999 Parliament of World Religions, our family as Quaker delegates, and guests of the Deputy Minister of Defense at the time, Nozizwe Madlala- Routledge, also Quaker.When the discussion turned to coffee shops, given [Nirel's project](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/newflash-lights-on-in-toontown.html), we learned about [The Great Good Place](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Good-Place-Bookstores-Community/dp/1569246815), a book helping to define the role such institutions might play in our culture, or already do in some cases.  The Communknitty in San Jose also typifies this pattern language, which doesn't have to center around coffee.Dawn filtered the newspaper for me this morning, before getting her toes done with [Aim√©e](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/tie-die-project.html), pointed me to a [Math Wars](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/) report on B2, and to an email address on C1 for reporting "early user impressions" of the new Metro-Fi service.  I'll forward a link to my [recent report](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/newflash-lights-on-in-toontown.html) on that subject.
