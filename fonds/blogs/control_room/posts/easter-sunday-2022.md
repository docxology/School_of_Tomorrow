Greetings to the blogosphere.  We used to call it that more, back when we used the word "sphere" about everything, a German language influence no doubt (half kidding:  thinking Sloterdijk).

I'm a working class hero, or lets say "essential worker" this Easter.  I'll be working through Ramadan as well, but with adjusted hours (many in this cohort will be observing).  My clock time schedule today is not too onerous.  I do have visiting family, as this Easter coincides, almost, with Carol turning 93.

Back to the theme of institutional wealth:  there's a lot of momentum from wills past.  Foundations and so on.  In terms of targeted funding, that's where fund accounting comes in, the kind of bookkeeping that makes it easier for donors to trace and audit whether their earmarks were respected.  If the check was sent for a groundwater pump, where's the pump?  With their name on it (figuratively, in the bookkeeping).

Software allows nit-picky micromanagement whereas human intelligence is about when to break some silly rule.  Management is always reshaping the clay of organizational intelligence, a beast in its own right some say.  Church politics is somewhat similar.  Even when practiced by Methodists I would assume.

I woke up to some new Graham Phillips footage from Mariupol, which I watched beginning to end and then forwarded onto Facebook.  Sometimes we mark great tragedies against the wheeling calendar of whatever holy days. During class tonight, I'll be presenting some Naval Observatory program, recast in Python, designed to find Easter on any given year, within a range.
