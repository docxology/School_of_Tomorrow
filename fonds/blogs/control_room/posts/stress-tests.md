You might see where China is [getting impatient](http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2009-03-13-china-us-economy_N.htm), if the long term plan is to [avoid any storyboard](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/storyboarding-tomorrow.html) and just talk about how to jump start moribund industries, to force a return to [business as usual](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/us_world/2009/03/09/2009-03-09_chinese_sailors_strip_to_underwear_after.html), a losing proposition.  They're investing in [Pepperland](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=pepperland), not [Blue Meanies](http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&hl=en&q=blue+meanies), if that makes any sense.  This will require "[imagination](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNuO3Bp9cLI)" as Spongebob might say ([remember viiv](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-about-geek-tv.html)?).Fortunately, the art community is striking the flint, rubbing two sticks, trying to get something going.  [The Bucky exhibit](http://www.mcachicago.org/buckminster/), recently at [the Whitney](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/more-adult-education.html), is moving to Chicago.  I hope to take it in during my stay, given [4D Geometry](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/re-nkg.html) is integral within my Portland-made brand of [Pythonic Math](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html).  My two XOs already trace to friendly ties with Hong Kong (XOs run a Python GUI atop Linux, [known as Sugar](http://magazine.redhat.com/2007/02/23/building-the-xo-introducing-sugar/)).  I wasn't a direct participant in G1G1, although I admire that campaign.[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3224143594/)Speaking of Bucky, there's a new book coming out that I somewhat expect to fall in the "[Bucky as Britney](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/poor-slob-bucky-psb.html)" genre (soap opera stuff), given I was at no point contacted about the [hard core](http://synchronofile.com/?page_id=21) Synergetics aspects (bleeped over by Whitney as well).  Anyone claiming "due diligence" will at least cite [my work](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/) in this area.  That's likely not the focus though, probably something more tabloid.
