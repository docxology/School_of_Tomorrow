I play around with it, swapping gizmos in and out.I get a Buddhist thought for the day thing via RSS, which I don't always check, but I popped it just now:War can only be understood and put an end to if you and all those who are concerned very deeply with the survival of man, feel that you are utterly responsible for killing others.

Krishnamurti That reminds me of some stuff I wrote awhile back, but I'm not finding it right now plus I'm noticing lots of badly formatted pages at my [grunch.net web site](http://www.grunch.net/).
