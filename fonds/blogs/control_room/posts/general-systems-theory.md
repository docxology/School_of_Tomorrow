Certainly economists compete with one another to become stars in their own field, but the discipline as a whole still suffers from a monopolistic mindset. When it comes to fixing spending priorities, economists still seem to think there's only one game in town, namely Economics.General Systems Theory aims to compete with [Economics](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/econ-101.html), by covering some of the same territory with a newer map, sort of the way astronomy gradually took over from astrology, when it came to such challenges as putting [humans on the Moon](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/some-space-program-history.html). We needed to be more scientific, more deeply appreciative of nature's role. GST owes more to ecology than economics.Contributors to our field include [Kenneth Boulding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_E._Boulding), [Ludwig von Bertelanffy](http://www.isss.org/lumLVB.htm), [James Schlesinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Schlesinger), [Barbara Marx Hubbard](http://www.disinfo.com/archive/pages/dossier/id367/pg1/index.html), [R.
