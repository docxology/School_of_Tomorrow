If I could wave a magic wand and give gifts to Baghdad (to share with environs of course), I'd probably put the following under the tree: Office and Home Depot outlets (substantial ownership in both chains, including stateside), a SeaWorld (Iraqis choose the site), lots of steady, cheap electricity (they can certainly afford it), membership in Costco, a new science museum (like [OMSI](http://www.omsi.org/)), Netflix.These gifts would be delivered [irregardless](http://www.answers.com/irregardless&r=67) of religious affiliation or sexual orientation.In the USA, Xmas is a commercial/secular holiday, on which religions piggy-back. Jesus was not likely born on December 25 and in any case the gift-bearing Magicians showed up later (ritually on [Epiphany, January 6](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/christmas-folk-lore.html)).The USA traces its origins to many Roman institutions (evident to anyone visiting Washington, DC), including [Saturnalia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia).  None of which is to say there's anything wrong with Christians piggy- backing on our secular holiday, as long as they don't mind sharing it with the rest of us.
