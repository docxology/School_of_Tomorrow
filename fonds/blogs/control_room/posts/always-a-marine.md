I just listened to John Rushing's [latest interview](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11067689&sc=emaf) with Terry Gross, regarding his new book and career as a correspondent for the English language version of Al Jazeera. Given the etymology of [this blog](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/blog-launch.html), and my tracking of [Rushing's career](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/busy-day.html), I feel obligated to comment; the relevance quotient is so high.And my comments are very positive.  Count me a Rushing fan, even though I [don't get](http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/mar2006/gb20060323_571451.htm) Al Jazeera on my DirecTV.
