:: Leap of Faith ::

Our Knowledge Engineering meeting was wide ranging this morning. I was a tad late, having immersed myself in the USSA meme, one I've used, but so have others. There's that sense of a no longer, yet hauntingly familiar, state: the USSR, undergoing somewhat convulsive changes (perestroika and glasnost), much as the USSA is undergoing today, in the DOGE chapter. 

We must return to our roots to stay grounded (sounds like something AI might write).

A chief topic was DAF's meetup (recorded) with Dante, another influencer in the Synergetics-on-YouTube space (where I too am active). I caught up later, whereas Struppi and Andrius both joined the Livestream. 

Dante is conversant with some of the same esoterica I first learned from that Frances Yates book, The Art of Memory. Both in M4W and 52LivingIdeas (YouTube communities with Zoom meetups, led by Andrius and Shrikant respectively), we were always coming up with "schemata" or "circuit diagrams" (networks, graphs, toons...) i.e. more graphical than lexical, and this continues a Mnemonics or Memetics tradition (a science of Memes). 

Per some namespaces, one could say we're encountering, as well as encouraging, a more right-brained based blend, without meaning anything specifically right vs left wing politically. 

Biology and politics each keep to their own sets of axes, where bilateral symmetry is concerned. I was ranting about how "right vs left" is so often too vacuous, if allowed to remain un-nuanced by beaucoup other dimensions. Data science teaches "too few axes" is a pitfall.

Robert Fludd works in this right brain lineage, as does William Blake, both in some ways prefiguring the geometric philosophy in Synergetics. I'm tempted to speak of Neoplatonism.

Fuller has a lot of trust on automated processes, not of human origin, humans themselves not having designed themselves. That humans haven't the know-how to go beyond robots, is less any theological argument than an acknowledgment of a kind of epiphenomenalism in Fuller's writings. 

Our cogitos have a steering function, but then life supplies a somewhat "on rails" experience, has the aspect of a dark ride, with"dark ride" being theme park jargon for one of those indoor guided "tunnel of love" type experiences, e.g. Pirates of the Caribbean at Disney's. 

Some project Bucky as a naive type of technocrat engineer who thinks he has a technofix for human nature. Yet for Fuller, the nature in human nature isn't the problem. The "cosmic conspiracy" is on our side, and doesn't depend on our all being awake at the same time.

My goal these days is to credit the CERN physics community for the web first, the LHC second, in terms of making a big difference. 

Great to have both. 

I was ravenous for hypertext just out of Princeton, but everyone was reinventing the wheel by going proprietary, whereas Tim Berners-Lee did something open source and therefore viral. HTTP spread on its own, into all the nooks and crannies of the emerging internet, as another protocol, and the Web as we know it was born, fulfilling the Dr. Vannevar Bush vision -- and feeding the MEMEX to come (LLMs a good example). 

LHC comes in 2nd place because we're not pushing for a GUT or TOE in finding out about the smallest physical phenomena possible, perhaps with least heat (cryogenics, superconductivity). 

All of which is to say, we're not stressing Physics to be a "controller discipline" able to take over governance because we don't believe in Free Will. We're not looking to "reduce everything to Physics" so much as we're willing to let the Sciences each have their respective layers, with laws and walls of their own, separate cities, yet with traffic between them. 

The larger does not "rest upon" the smaller in the sense of the former bringing nothing new to the table. On the contrary, the Principle of Synergetic Advantage assures us of a yet more meta environment and higher level of play, provided we don't get too stuck in these teachings from the lower levels. 

There's more to life than black holes.

Regarding the leaping circus tiger jumping back and forth through a flaming hoop: the represents something Dante and Daniel talked about, a core meme in Synergetics, that of the pumping VE. 

The VE, like a heart, twist down into a more Icosahedral (five-fold) pattern, left or right handed, jumping through a "cosmic zero" in between. The VE phase is not a stable stopping point even if it serves as anchor. 

The dichotomy is "open versus closed minded" with "closed" a sign of adequacy and appropriate reflexing, and "open" a sign of taking new information into account, retraining to some extent. Neither "open" nor "closed" need be morally rated given they're two sides of the same proverbial coin.
