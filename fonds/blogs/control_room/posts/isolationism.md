I hear a lot of talking head pundits expressing their frustration with "isolationist" tendencies within the American electorate, as if blundering on the world stage, pistols drawn, shooting at anything that moves, weren't a perfect recipe for self-isolating.Â 

I can't think of a more isolationist regime than this outgoing one run by President Blinken (not a typo). Threatening the world with sanctions or worse is no way to make friends. To alienate everyone else is to isolate oneself: these are basic facts of English grammar.

The real issue is the world needs high IQ solutions whereas bombing and rubblizing is low IQ barbaric. We see a lot of throwback Planet of the Apes behavior, as outgoing boomers act out their tired old fantasies, juvenile and retro though they be. No one can stop them apparently. The endless cycle of revenge, punch and counterpunch, keeps the melodrama churning.

Whereas the males of the planet deserve better, the oldsters still see them as cannon fodder, expendable, unto "the last Ukrainian" as they say. The IDF is likewise full of males and females alike who never signed up to become expendable extras in someone else's grand plan. Hearts and minds are still relevant.

As always, we need to draw the line between respect and fear. People may fear being carpet bombed by B52s, but I can't think of anyone I know who thinks carpet bombing is the answer, or has respect for those that do. My inner circle isn't that degenerate. Too bad if yours is. I'm not an isolationist in that way, even if you are.
