In an effort to understand some already working code, I've been delving into Pyro, [Python Remote Objects](http://pyro.sourceforge.net/), along with the [pyprocessing library](http://pyprocessing.berlios.de/), getting a Mother daemon to feed tasks to [worker bees](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/google-gets-video.html) under a Queen, each one a process.  I've got [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) taking the place of a bigger gorilla in the target [TurboGears application](http://turbogears.org/).
