Some literati and cogniscenti want a simple linear tale, nothing too parallel, with forking.

[As a Quaker](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/quaker-roots.html) though, with "Beanite" a parent class, I'm used to forking and have no problem with Pragmatism and Transcendentalism running parallel, even unto this day and age.
