I think everyone agrees the [Kodak Pavilion](http://www.kodak.com/) is like a joke, except for the [octet truss](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/octet.html) superstructure, in showcasing very ho hum ideas about the future, kind of like GM did (North America:  home of the dinosaurs, like [Jurassic Park](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/) on steroids).So it's not like Americans are interested in creating good family wage jobs right now, given pessimism is so in vogue, but were they wishing to do so, a revamp of Epcot is long overdue.  First:  set it back to an acronym, [EPCOT](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/09/return-to-moon.html), like Disney intended.  Second:  avail of all that NASA type talent, that migrated to The Mouse [after Apollo](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/apollo-chronicles.html).North Americans are good at showcasing future alternatives, getting feedback from focus groups, and that includes futuristic lifestyles using such as [EcoMotion mobiles](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/10/at-dealership.html), [FEDs](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/community-night.html), other [newfangled toyz](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/back-to-school.html).  Unlike Hollywood, we don't require suspension of disbelief at every turn.  We may not have Santa hammered out yet, but we do make real motor cars ([electric motors](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/who-killed-electric-car-movie-review.html) included).Remember, [Control Room](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/) had it first (we rock over here).
