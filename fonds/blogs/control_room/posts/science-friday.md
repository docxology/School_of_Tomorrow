I thought Harold Salzman of the Urban Institute did some significant backpedaling [today](http://www.sciencefriday.com/program/archives/200711092), conceding most points his rhetorical opponents were making.Salzman's view:  the education situation may be dire, concerning, but it's not apocalyptic.  Kids today know a lot more about computers than did kids thirty years ago.  Compared to where we were, we're not all that different, on average -- never mind where the rest of the world is going, that's not what this study was about.  "If my son or daughter is as informed and aware as I was, when I was his or her age, then things can't really be that bad" seems to be the attitude here. A semi-static picture should be no cause for alarm.Yes, the cream of the crop is still pretty creamy, and given the [intellectual squalor](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/war-story.html) in which we live, there's really not that much demand for even more engineers, not counting those in the destruction business, of which there's a severe shortage right now (hence [Stop-Loss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop-loss_policy)).  Destructive engineering is still a bonanza source of family wage jobs, thanks to myopic policymakers.  [Cruise missiles](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/wanderers-2007918.html) R Us.Those disillusioned would-be design scientists might be more in demand in some other, [more futuristic](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/blind-spots.html) civilization, some parallel universe, one in which [World Game](http://usmilitary.about.com/od/army/l/blarstoploss.htm) was actually mentioned out loud ([gasp!](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/our-land.html)).  Indeed, lack of hope in the future was cited as a major reason for students getting turned off, abandoning their hopes and dreams i.e. all that homework to what end, given [global warming](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/inconvenient-truth-movie-review.html) and the impending economic downturn?  [Fear over longing](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/isepp-lecture-end-of-season.html), once again (an [old story](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/why-civilizations-fail.html)).So what's this [Urban Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Institute) anyway?  Mostly middle of the road [liberal types](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/starvation-torture.html), of the kind who lost the [War on Poverty](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html), got us mixed up in Vietnam?I liked Intel's Craig R. Barrett's thinking better:  if we don't shape up, USAers will get creamed in the global jobs market.  I think that's correct, but in the backs of their minds, some so-called liberals still just knee-jerk assume we'll have to write off the less privileged as unsalvageable.  They then sugar coat their thinly disguised [Malthusianism](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html) in various bureaucratic policymaking voices, [like FEMA does](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/11/07/cbsnews_investigates/main3469283.shtml) when talking about those post-Katrina toxic trailers: all blather, and no action, because the mindset between the ears is quite broken.Let's talk about "mental poverty" for a change, and acknowledge it might come dressed up in a suit and carry a briefcase, with fancy degrees and all the rest of it.  Losers come in all stripes, don't they?
