:: lock simulation in Second Life ::A recent theme of various meetings: "infrastructure parks" for young people, providing them with opportunities to familiarize themselves with dikes, dams, barge channels, [locks](http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/falkirk/falkirkwheel/index.html), cranes for shifting loads between water and rail.These are more than just toys in some ways, as they're serving as [job simulation tools](http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Bill_Richardson_Technology.htm) -- a reason to call them [toyz](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/toyz.html) instead, as in e-toyz.Some versions of these facilities are run indoors, mostly for [university level](http://www.shipanalytics.com/MS/SHS.asp) students. Others have a more toy-like appearance and are built from more robust, child-safe materials. In between are the science museum simulations, often supervised by young adults, and shared with teens and tweens.Of course many kids get [infrastructure training](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/02/simulators-in-world-game.html) from software these days, from [Trainz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trainz) for example. These [software versions](http://www.shipsim.com/) are often easier to implement, especially when modeling such facilities as [airports](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-May/008597.html) or hospitals.
