In case my [Gift Shop proposal](https://www.omsi.edu/science-store) flies, I've talked to Glenn about a tour.  Area Program Committee is considering a proposal to fill in for the missing Laughing Horse Book Store and Video Collective ("nothing lasts forever but the earth and sky" -- Kansas). 

There's [a hole in this town](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/03/back-at-laughing-horse.html) that Friends could help fill, both programmed and unprogrammed.

501(c)(3) nonprofit corporations are allowed to sell swag. 

But this would be more than a swag shop.  We'd have vintage Peace buttons, educational materials. Proceeds fund our non-profit programs. 

We get around needing to provide ADA compliance to this rickety old building (the one we're touring) by having the organizing meetups elsewhere. 

We can do sales outside on summer days, so if you're on crutches you'll still get access.

[The competition](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/05/axing-staff-in-west-region.html) wants a strictly back office low profile in a little trafficked part of town (comparatively). 

Their building is for sale and unstable in that sense but the back office people don't seem to worry as they have few responsibilities and no programs. 

Our program people are in the field. 

Why a small city like Portland should get Philadelphia-type jobs is a bit of a mystery. 

"Back office" is what Friends Center is for, is what we thought, not West Region where we need to be [public-facing and engaged](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/04/portland-afsc-support-committee.html).
