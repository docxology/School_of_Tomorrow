I'm in the Michael Jennings Chair of Computer Science, a welcome hand-me-down from [a darling FNB couple](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6131322437/in/set-72157627512153141).  This chair was presented pre the Chairman's trip to Brazil, which so far sounds marvelous. They drug it up to the 3rd floor, not far from Hawthorne Theater.  Holden chose wisely, among neighborhoods. Welcome to 97214.

I got to Wanderers too late to blog anything about the electric bicycle fashion in Portland.  It's a lifestyle option some opt for.  [My electric ATV and electric snowmobile fantasies](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/etcha-sketch-view.html) somewhat dovetail.  Anyway, the speaker had departed well before I got there.  Not complaining, as I was having a lovely time down the street, near Angelo's.

[I'm back on the front lines](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7623365&tstart=0) of Math Reform again today, an old beat of mine by now, count me as one of the grays.  Speaking of which, I was riffling through [Powell's on Hawthorne](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/09/powells-on-hawthorne.html) and found an old copy of Everything is Under Control by Robert Anton Wilson.

I bought it for under $13 in part for nostalgia value.  Under GRUNCH there's my website teleport.com/~pdx4d/grunch.html

Thank you RAW.  The then owner of Teleport married a member of our Quaker meeting (I was at the wedding) and I later bought [the domain ](http://www.grunch.net/)[grunch.net](http://www.grunch.net/) to continue with that work.

Glenn has just arrived, with Amber, his daughter.  We're saying good bye to Steve, who departs for Europe tomorrow. Alex Aris came by after, meeting me at the bus stop, bidding our Chairman adieu before he fell asleep.
