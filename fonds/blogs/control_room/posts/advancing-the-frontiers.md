We’re very close to Carol’s birthday.  She’ll be 93 on the 21st.  Julie, my sister, her daughter, is coming for a visit.

Before I head out to the airport tomorrow morning, I’m expecting to lurk in on Gerald de Jong’s presentation to FieldStructure Institute.  

Glenn has been having a lot of fun with Don Briddell’s book, as did I, even though neither of us specializes in neutrinos.
