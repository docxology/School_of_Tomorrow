I'm still attached to my grunch.net, a literary venture and obvious allusion to Grunch of Giants, a bold work to begin with.  Today it verged on turning into a 403, but for some serious interventions.  I wasn't finding my backup...

I lot of us pile up a body of work out in cyberspace, or really anywhere.  The attachments criss-cross through time and space.

Grunch.net is on a budget server somewhere, not that well protected.  What triggered today's saga was the obvious presence of malware.
