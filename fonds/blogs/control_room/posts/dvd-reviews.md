I gradually wend my way through these "reviews" taking each as a broad license to talk about whatever.  I stray into 911 territory quite a bit, and even fly over the JFK region, in the Land of Lore.

My Ex Machina review is especially cursory, as I'd not yet [re-seen](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/06/ex-machina-movie-review.html) it.  Last night I did and reiterate what I say in the Youtube.  This is a remarkable movie, in terms of exploring what Deep AI would really mean.

The computer would have to know how to lie, for openers, as that's deeply characteristic of what humans do.  I like "dissemble" as a synonym.

Then there's employing outright deception.  Our usual idea of AI is less real (less like RI i.e. Real Intelligence). This movie points out our naivete.
