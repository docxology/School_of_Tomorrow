What's going on here?

I'm inserting myself into an ongoing debate, but at a different frequency.

The global grid is not just a Chinese idea.  You need to tune out an important chapter in Western Civ, namely World Game, to think so.  That's what historians have been doing:  tuning us out.

Chinese and Russians enjoy playing World Game with us, because we've done our homework.
