 I have a lot on my plate to write about, including [the closing ISEPP lecture](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/05/engineering-as-moral-enterprise.html) for this season, Terry summing up engineering as a moral enterprise (up to some good, one always hopes).

Let me mention the [Gift Shop idea](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/05/conference-call.html) and where that went:  Body Art.

That'd be quite consistent with Third Eye across the street and is completely compatible with the decal-based art already in the mix.

So that's a win.

Yes, I'm talking about Peace Sign (or even Peace Corps sign) tattoos, for many significant, including among the Laughing Horse reading and viewing circles. 

With most taboos removed and stereotypes crumbling, there's a niche somewhere on Hawthorne no doubt.

Glenn is repainting.
