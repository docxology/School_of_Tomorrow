Math teachers in North America would appear to have [first dibs](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/literary-investigation.html) on [this heritage](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2047973&tstart=0), but seem to have shrugged it off (can't be bothered).Is this [another chapter](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2045815&tstart=15) where the wisdom of the ages is kept in hibernation through another dark age, by Arabic speaking cultures?I met with a teacher of that language this evening at The Bagdad, [sent a link](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2047973&tstart=0), just in case.Lindsey is downtown attending a study group on legalized zombiehood ([corporate personhood](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/corporation-movie-review.html)).
