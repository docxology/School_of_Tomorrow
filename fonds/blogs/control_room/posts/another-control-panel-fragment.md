I've been using the above control panel to scan for relevant projectable citables to help my audiences get a grip on some recent history.Here's an ad citing Bucky's infamous "nature is not using pi" meme, which in 1980 sounded fresh enough to serve as a recruiting tool. This company is looking to hire some new crew members.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEih7y46oHyvpCBY2WVaCM2aHgMv5F-4z5udf08-nDbYHGboWemaOXY7tsyyfJcDzMYYVDtglHxqkmxfbodavzOly6zQ7mm51O-jQEfGLDAZK1IstdMOwfnCuxAvpPIivW8_BN1j/s1600-h/successnopi.png)NYT ad: Apr 27, 1980 pg.

So that's Shirley Sharky on the left (below). I got to meet her in Ed's Georgetown apartment during that big shindig in 2004 he cohosted with his daughter Ashton, with foci of her own. 

I got to share lasagna with Thomas Zung and Shoji Sadao as well. Dick Fischbeck was in the little kitchenette where Ed kept the gin. 

Anyway, I tend to get a little giddy when I'm around so many beautiful people all packed into a single meetup like that.

Tonight's closing story: Lake Superior is at an [81 year low](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/06/21/eveningnews/main2963810.shtml). How low will she go? [Container ships](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-June/007977.html) are especially affected.
