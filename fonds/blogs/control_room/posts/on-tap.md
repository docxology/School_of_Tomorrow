She has a chip on her shoulder with do gooder USA type MDs though, and their prima donna "need to check my email" attitude in the midst of [battlefield conditions](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/gym-meditation.html).Doctors without borders from other necks of the wood [aren't so full of themselves](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/what-bleep-movie-review.html) usually.I know some good doctors though, mentioned [International Medical Teams](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/field-trip.html).The interview was reminiscent of my meeting at Noah's Bagels with [Kimmerly](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/wanderers-2007821.html), talking [about OLPC](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/silicon-forest-news.html) and [Darfur](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/darfur.html).  In both cases, the goal was to remain headquartered in PDX, joining "away team" missions.[Razz](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2899626021/) made it [through DEQ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2905803364/) on her first try no problemo.I'm heading into this conference on The Future of Friends, another Quarterly, [like last year's](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/10/quarterly-meeting-wqm-fall-2007.html).  Don't expect a lot of blogging for the duration.  [M4B](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/more-wild-west-biz.html) with [Ron Marson](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/04/extremely-remote-living-xrl_10.html) expected.I'm on tap through IEEE for giving a talk on Bucky at [the Armory](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157606708448728/) this fall, looking forward.  I'm also picking up some new [Python proteges](http://www.python.org/) for "piano lessons" (laptops are like musical instruments, [more like guitars](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/08/gibson-bizmo.html) maybe?).
