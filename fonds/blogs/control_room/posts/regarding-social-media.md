Copied from The Ecology of System Thinking group on Facebook, comment by me, just now:

I like philosophies which remove the omniscient organizers  who will provide the new game plans, and go back to cybernetic basics ala the invisible hand -- which gets caught red handed and visible sometimes, i.e. we get glimmerings of conspiracies as we grow our own organs of discernment (hypothetical faculties).
But in the final analysis, no management cabal is situated in some uber control room with puppet strings to the rest.  The Dr. Evil types all have limited radius, as do the Dr. Goods.Many reformist philosophies decry the status quo, but do buy the idea of "those at the top" who might institute the new designs "from above" and/or "from below". More likely, the longer lasting new designs emerge from fragmentary attempts by the many factions, and do not bare the stamp of a conscious consensus. Hence all the complaining and protests by ostensive servants of whatever status quo. Where we find the more consciously designed social agreements is at a relatively micro size, of under a few hundred humans, some living, some not.  These are what I would identify as "ethnicities" which are always surrounded by other ethnicities (partially overlapping).
