[Jim Buxton](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/10/libyan-eclipse.html) is projecting pictures from his recent stay, with partner, in an off-grid XRL, solar and wind powered, in California.I gave a "rolling thunder" (vs. lightning) talk about [my GIS in Action talk](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/gis-2009.html), blending in a report from Chicago.  I talked through [the Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157617152555758/) then flipped through [the PDF](http://www.4dsolutions.net/presentations/gis_2009_workshop.pdf) of my OpenOffice Presentation.David Tver got a lot of value out of his early model programmable calculator, studying chaos, ray tracing, likewise from his Commodore 64.  In my case, the HP-65 proved influential (RPN with stack).Bill Sheppard had a stereogram of a nebula he'd printed.  He jokes the images were taken 10K light years apart, to give the right parallax.I was glad to get Warren and Carter Sande's Hello World! Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners in the mail yesterday, a book for learning Python, also happy to see my name in the acknowledgments.Thanks Jimmy, for letting me borrow the lawn mower again.  I abused it some, but it proved up to the job.[Ubuntu's Jaunty Jackalope](http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/linux/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=217000047&subSection=News) is in the news today.
