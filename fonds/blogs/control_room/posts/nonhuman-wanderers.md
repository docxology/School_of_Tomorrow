No, I'm not talking about ETs.  Or I could include them, but right now I'm thinking of Ts (terrestrials), such as dogs and cats and like that.  Yes, and snakes.

In my vocab, a Wanderer is a type of flaneur, meaning a bystander-observer, which doesn't mean innocent so much as aware and willing to chronicle and communicate, a reporter, a journalist.  Nonhumans don't commit their observations to writing, but they do register and adapt.

We had an organization named Wanderers, just a coffee-sharing morning / evening coven, or whatever group word, a meetup.  We met (still do) in the boyhood home of one Linus Pauling, winner of two Nobel prizes (unshared -- although his wife Ava Helen had a lot to do with the one for peace).

Humans on this planet tend to be delighted by their nonhuman companions, even as they slaughter them in droves.  Part of the satisfaction we get from our herds is our ability to eat them.  Not everyone is into it.

Planet Earth is still delightful, even if sometimes overtaxed by obnoxious behaviors.  Humans have a track record of adapting, but also of not adapting.  We need to accommodate our own slowness in some ways.  How do we cut ourselves slack, without crashing the plane, so to speak?

I'm not posing as the answer man, but I do share the view that humans learn from nonhumans all the time.  Sometimes we learn the basic value of companionship.  Other times, we're reminded to pay sharp attention and keep a lookout.
