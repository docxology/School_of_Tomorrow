We joined in the Xmas frenzy a bit today, sweeping through both a Valde*mart and a We Be Toys (names changed to protect the innocent), ending up in an upscale toy shop, Wakey's, in downtown Portland near the Multnomah County Library.On another front, we chickened out of a ["Class C" camper van](http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&q=%22class+c%22+camper+van) opportunity, once the subject of antifreeze came up.  It'd cost extra to thaw the unit, plus we'd need to commit to supplying an AC umbilical cord solution come evenings, with temperatures averaging in the low teens, well below freezing (Fahrenheit, sorry) -- otherwise her sink 'n can would freeze right up again.Using keyboard and mouse, I morphed the camper into an SUV and felt relieved for having done so.  Lining up campus housing isn't a problem. The bigger vehicle will help us lug around the O2 concentrator, useful at high altitudes.[ When more gnu math teachers take to the road in [real bizmos](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/rethinking-cyberbookmobile-concept.html) someday, the problem of "mooring" will have more routine solutions depending on which economic sector is being served, e.g. a brand X certified pro might snuggle up to an appropriate campus building and jack in, whereas other brands of roving road warrior might prefer the sweet seclusion of less urban sites, less smack in the middle of some [academential](http://cat.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/wickedary/index.cgi?history=academentia%7C&word=academentia) funny farm.]Uncle Bill swung through again in his red Aztek, bearing pie and an invitation to lunch up on Hawthorne (Bridgeport's Portland Ale House was our selection).  He's done about all he might humanly do to promote his [well crafted history](http://www.beneaththesurface.info/) of pre-WWI submarine building in the Pacific Northwest.  He's taking some time off to just enjoy life, is looking forward to Colorado.We're bummed about missing [Laurie's](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/home-schooling.html) and Terry's Hannukah party [again](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/hanukkah-party.html) this year, but still plan to celebrate.  Plus there's another party I'm not mentioning, a surprise -- but we're missing that too.  Turning down invitations is a part of life.  [Ed](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html) had to do it all the time, especially as he got older.
