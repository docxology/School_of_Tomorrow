[William Irwin Thompson](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/about-branding.html), mentioned on the above ([not glossy](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/glossy-magazines.html)) magazine cover, has written extensively on the Pacific Shift.

In our [Silicon Forest region](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/03/silicon-forest-curriculum.html), that means more connections within the Pacific Rim economy, which includes parts of Russia, as well as Japan, China and Southeast Asia.  The increasing political closeness of Russia, much in the news, has its benefits.

I know some of the billionaire cabals are hoping to [increase tensions](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/02/rabble-babble.html) between the two hemispheres, as that's where the money is from their angle (endless war).

Out here on the Pacific Rim, we have different [billionaire cabals](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/russiagate.html) with their own agendas.

The "commemorative ruble" below is of course a joke (see latest issue of Mercury), and is a measure of how not concerned we are about the [emerging pacifist economy](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/02/pacific-shift.html).
