Whereas I've been doomy gloomy [about Jackalope](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/jackalope-down.html), suspect thermal events, not the software in this case, Tara actually crossed a cool milestone:  the braces came out, retainer for sleeping.  Dr. Joe has been kind to us, and his talented staff.Mom had a routine checkup, doing well at 79, though with new stuff to work on post her hospital workup, rather thorough (she had like two pounds of medical records to hand off).My thanks to [TC](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-on-t-shirts.html) for checking in, another fine public worker [for Oregon State](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/big-science.html), now back to being "pirate sector" ([yar!](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/yar.html)).
