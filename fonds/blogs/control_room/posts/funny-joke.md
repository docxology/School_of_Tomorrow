I got this [from Brenda](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/02/live-from-dorkbot.html).  A New Yorker cartoon?  She might've made it up (she's one smart cookie), and in any case tells it better than I do.

ET viewing Earth through ship's window: "Signs of intelligent life  captain." Captain: "they must be well-defended then, we'd better leave!"

ET:  scratch that captain, they've got plenty of weapons, but they're all aimed at themselves.  Unintelligent.  No danger.
