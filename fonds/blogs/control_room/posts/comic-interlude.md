:: occupation of world's smallest park, Mill Ends Park in Portland, Oregon ::

[Sam](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/04/flextegrity-sales.html) was pounding the table today, saying we weren't ephemeralizing fast enough.

We were at Laurelwood Brew Pub planning a next gala event, in part a homecoming for those who'd been at RISD this year, for [the SNEC event](http://synergeticscollaborative.org/snec.announce.meeting.2011.11.html) (yeah, insider jargon, I'm full of it).

On the ephemeralization front, Occupy is in the lead, taking over the world's smallest municiple park today, according to the Guiness Book of World Records. [Hi Cameron](http://portlandcitycenter.katu.com/news/weird/449951-arrest-made-after-worlds-smallest-park-occupied).

It'll be a failure of capitalism this Xmas if we don't already have the action figure kits, manger scene scale (like toy army guys), with little anarchists with tents, little riot cops with vans.

Junior can line up the cops around the camp while the anarchists amass.  Depending on political leanings, the narrative may go differently.

Some will put the baby Jesus right inside a tent ([Food Not Bombs tent?](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/virtual-opdx.html)), complete with straw, cute animals, and a few defectors from the 1% ([the three Magi](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/christmas-folk-lore.html)).

Others will have their policemen smash those dirty commies with gusto, MacArthur style (President Hoover as King Herod?), while mom & dad beam proudly.

Koski has been replying to Zubek on Youtube, sharing the war on Poly, where grown children are still grumbly-grumpy about Bucky getting a molecule named after himself 'n stuff, when he really didn't invent anything new.

How can you put a refrigerator in a dome shaped home anyway?

Gimme a break right?

I bet they talk like this at Harvard all the time (snicker, superior Princeton sniff).

Me to David (typo fixed):

This stuff about the fridge:

You should remind folks that many of the architects working with
Fuller came up with more conventional rectilinear "stage prop"
interiors, that would protect privacy, but not have to be weatherized,
as the surrounding dome was doing that.  More efficient, by simple
back of the napkin computations.  More green.  More sustainable.

In fact, Fuller's designs were quite smart and his cultist followers,
e.g Kirby Urner, think the ambient culture just didn't have the IQ.
"It's Planet of the Apes around here" is his usual off-the-kuffka
remark ([cuffka.com](http://cuffka.com/)).

The usual picture, duh:

(duh rectilinear as you like inside -- could be a city)

All this crap about the refrigerator is just teasing at recess, not
serious in any way.  "Hey, your zipper's down!".

I'm something of a misanthropist when it comes to mean little children
that grew up to become mean little adults.
 I've been [yukking it up](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Wittrs/message/7120) on the Wittgenstein list too.
