As the solstice draws nigh, I felt moved by the spirit to clean up Dawn's meditation space, aka our branch office of Portland Knowledge Lab ([PKL](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/02/portfolio-night.html) -- somewhat patterned after London's).  We've also got a portable altar ready, borrowing mostly from [R](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/three-altars.html).Some of the coastal Friends I plan to visit got to know me through [Camp Myrtlewood](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-about-quakers.html), a Church of the Brethren facility (see [Urner geneology](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/whats-urner.html) for more ties).  We were young then, juggling torches, sharing memes (sometimes jeans).  Obviously we came from many walkx of life (including this AI guy from Apple), although most were from Oregon and California, a few from Washington.When my partner Dawn Wicca joined Quakers, she was clear with her clearness committee she wasn't Christian and would that be OK.  In our neck of the woods, it most certainly was, at least in her case, as [our](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/03/labyrinth.html) brand of Quaker doesn't require buying in to the Protestants' authority structure, nor JudeoChristendom's for that matter,  much as we might study the Bible (not the only holy book).These latecomer colonists are welcome to their rituals, their shopping, but don't "own" this time of year in America and some Friends simply prefer to celebrate rebirth and reawakening with people who are very clear that they've never been subjugated by aliens (think of it as an Independence Day kind of thing).That being said, Dawn was also very Catholic, both in upbringing and outlook, was awed by the priesthood's mastery over ritual, especially around Easter time.
