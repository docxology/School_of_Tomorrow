Got Tara off to her debate meet, a road trip, student organized, parent supervised. I burned through much of the day in cyberspace, plane spotting or whatever I do, pretending I'm a [Howard Rheingold](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/04/smart-mobs.html) or [Amber Case](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/10/meetinghouse-again.html) (both cyber-anthropologists).I was in [a thread on mathfuture](http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/msg/2ec582585eb558c7?hl=end098696c2ea7426) with Alexander Bogomolny, webmaster for [Cut the Knot](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/), a useful source over the years.  I've linked to it from [Bizmo Diaries](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/).Then I shot down to FNB on my Captain Amerika bike or maybe she's Bat Woman. She was happy to be closer to her love interest, the FNB trailer, retrieved from another Ville.[Walker played the Casio and sang](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5417312219/in/photostream/) as we gradually dispersed, with some soon heading north to monastic facilities and/or the San Juans.Tara texted from the debate site.  Emails with mom, regarding AFSC business, with [Stallings](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/king-lear-play-review.html) re [Consoletti](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/01/hny-rabbit.html).[Holden](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/04/immersive-python.html) inbound.I've been reading up on White Metal Rabbit lore per some Chinese mnemonics.  I'm not sure any one culture has a monopoly on "memory palaces" though I could see where advances in spatial data management techniques would excite cross-cultural GUI development in mind's eye virtual modeling (a glass bead game (meme game)).Humans learn from their peers pretty quickly.  Make your teachings worth propagating.Happy New Year.
