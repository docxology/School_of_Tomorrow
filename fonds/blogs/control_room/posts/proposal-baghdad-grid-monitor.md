A graphical gizmo or gadget we'd like added to this control room: some quasi real time refreshing interface, perhaps a Java applet or XML-backed Flash widget, that gives an accurate picture of rolling [brownouts](http://enr.construction.com/news/front2003/archives/030421.asp) in [Baghdad](http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1425976,00.html). If traffic signals are affected, per [Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/inside-iraq-untold-stories-movie.html), this should receive special mention.

This web service could easily be expanded with more graphical gizmos as time goes on, e.g. it's not just [Baghdad](http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1220-06.htm) we care about. There'd be no special authorization required to view it. This information is public, not classified (which doesn't mean the CIA couldn't serve it and/or source the information).

Once this new web service is in place, we might think of various applications for it. For example, I might propose that for every hour some part of Baghdad is [without power](http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/16212671?source=Evening%20Standard), that the annual income of each USA congressperson automatically drops by one dollar. Of course that's way too forgiving, plus Congress'd find a loophole in about 10 seconds. So my proposal has symbolic value only. Still, I'd like to see the numbers.

Followup

Dan Rather got it right on David Letterman (2005.3.3): infrastructure, and the state of the Iraqi electrical grid in particular, is the barometer, the key parameter to watch (paraphrasing)
