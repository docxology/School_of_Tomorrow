I got Sellwood Middle School's guest Wifi unblocked from MIT Scratch web services.  That means I won't need to use Verizon for [my Show & Tell station](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2888711).

Now, hours later, I'm at Linus Pauling House. The house WiFi is down, perhaps by design, as I don't think external groups rent the building, whereas tenants supply their own?

Glenn is talking about collagen, macro-molecules, and new article [in Nature](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/12/global-data-global-matrix.html):  Patchy particles made by colloidal fusion by Gong, Hueckel, Yi and Sacanna, pag 234, Volume 550.

He keeps up on [multiple sciences](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/12/global-data-global-matrix.html), as sometimes only a layman can.

I say "layman" thinking back to the old [E.J. Applewhite](https://flic.kr/p/nJ229A) business card.  He thought this was a clever title.  I thought so too.

We're passing around the magazine.

Back on Verizon.
