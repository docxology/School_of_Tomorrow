We talked about [peak helium](http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Health/20120323/helium-gas-shortage-mri-120324/) a lot today.

I was on my laptop a lot of the time, listening to Nate, Lew etc. Â Grading, posting, writing to Alexia.

Nate is working on the problem of providing better connectivity to large outdoor gatherings, such as folk music festivals, by means of aerostats.

That's one of several projects he works on, including electronic medical records ([a place of overlap](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/shovel-ready.html)).
