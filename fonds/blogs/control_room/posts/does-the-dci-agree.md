FB friend:

? Tulsi Gabbard ?  Not sure who she is beyond Wikipedia. Had not heard of her before she declared.  What have I missed?

Me:

[I'm going around](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2019/06/sampling-facebook.html) saying Tulsi is indeed favored by the Kremlin so don't you
 believe those dino DNC types who still insist the Russians are Trump 
supporters. The point of the Trump Tower meetup was to discuss Magnitsky
 Act, at which point WaPo / NYT immediately tune out, as the goal is to 
focus on collusion against Hillary, not behind the scenes oligarch wars 
ala Browder.

Anyway, Tulsi is the obvious favorite on RT, and 
there's no reason to hire troll farms to make that clear, not when you 
have your very own CNN (i.e. propaganda machine). But unlike Matt 
Taibbi, I don't scream "McCarthyism" when NYT points out the Russians 
are backing a Hindu Hawaiian with no chance to win.

Free Assange 
and Manning, support blockchain voting, legalize weed, stop regime 
change wars, stop letting CIA run foreign policy (that's her "stop 
funding terrorists" bill). Two times service in Iraq, active duty in 
Hawaiian national guard. Proud of her Hawaiian heritage, like Obama.

My
 view is she's way too good to waste on a forlorn sorry office like the 
US presidency (designed for sickos these days), but at least we can take
 away the DNC crutch, of making Trump out to be Putin's favorite. No 
way. And so why are we afraid of the Russians again, when they're 
clearly backing a candidate with no chance to win?
