We may be getting closer to that [Guantanamo "theme park"](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/bomb-guantanamo.html) memorializing the USA's descent as a sovereign power under the globalizing influence of Pentagon-style capitalism aka ["cowardly capitalism"](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html) based on "cost plus" defense contracts.

[The mercenary industry](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/pentagon-public-or-private.html) became a boom sector, organized around the Goon Belt ([WDC](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/08/city-of-morons.html)).  Neocons ruled.  America suffered a huge loss in respect as the rest of the world [watched aghast](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-for-reconciliation.html) at its wild antics.

Lots of giant corporations were never fans of the Neocons however and [getting funding](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9678631) for such a theme park need not be a huge problem, especially if it's established as a non-profit.

The Cubans should not have to worry about coughing up the dough.  They weren't the cause of the problem and needn't pay the tab for [the cleanup](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/02/lame-analysis.html), which will take decades.
