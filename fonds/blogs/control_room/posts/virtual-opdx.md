Per my [intra Blue Tent memos](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/68095), I think a mistake of some other occupants is to think the 1% controls with money.  

There's [money involved](http://grunch.net/archives/27), but control is with spin, and the 1%, according to Bucky, are the ones most attuned to something he called "precession" (at which point we trail off, as apparently nobody knows what he meant by that -- the guy was just nuts right?).

On the Wittgenstein list, I make the point that [our Jew of Linz](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Wittrs/message/7089) had like superpowers in comparison to your average run of the mill Fortune 500 CEO capitalist, and yet he was an unemployed, [houseless vet](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Wittrs/message/7087) a lot of the time.  

Who are these "giants"?  "God only knows" right?  Reminds me of our "great pirates" discussion [on Internet Radio](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/adventures-in-radio-land-part-2.html).
