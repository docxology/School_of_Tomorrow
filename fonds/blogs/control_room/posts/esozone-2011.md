:: esozone 2011 ::

My main intent was to catch @mathpunk Tom Henderson in the act, and that I did.  We were first introduced [by Keith Loftstrom](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/11/parent-teacher-conferences.html) at a Barcamp ([#4 in PDX](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/10/barcamp-4.html) -- I'd been at the first).

I arrived just as he was taking the podium and stayed on through the Duke of Yuke, which I found relaxing.

Dinner with Alex had been a blast.

Now I'm back at the scene but all has gone quiet.

Steve Holden, the Chairman of a [small global dictatorship](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/67802), a virtual state, and myself, an unassuming Minister, would qualify as MVPs in many a diplomatic circle, but our presence here is unannounced.  I did not file a resume or advertise as a speaker, as I had no idea when the trip to Silverton would be over.

We came back by Hwy 214 from Silverton, through Woodburn, connecting with I-5 to Wilsonville, stopping at Fry's.  Tara had been interviewing for one of her choices of college (I joined at the end), then I united her with her champion debate team (the one she started as a sophomore).

I fondled the Brother MFC scanner / copier / color laser, going for about $500 -- on the high side compared to the others, but so like what I have now...  I tore myself away with Holden's help with a recharger for AA/AAA batteries, some of each, and a palette of [Red Bull](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/remembering.html) (sugar free), which Tara drinks also (a Taurus family), stocking stuffers (for a vestigial Xmas).

During our stopover at Blue House, I found Food Not Bombs cooking up a storm for the GA at Colonel Summers.  That might be a small one, like Holladay Park was (on my beat).

I know what it's like to show up with enough vegan chili for an army, to find only a few skate boarders with their boy and girl friends (which is fine -- plus sometimes we bring live performers, other entertainment, and blend in).

The temperature may get below water's freezing point tonight.  FNB was serving at the same site last night as well, but then we're troopers, were doing the same thing a year ago, and years before, even without an Occupation.

[Esozone](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/68519) is on the edge of China Town, or Old Town as we call it.  I parked just inside [the Chinese Gate](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6367364631/in/photostream) so Steve, a citizen of the UK, could see how America is dealing with its problems.  [Mike D](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6367365397/in/photostream) is a skilled worker.  I know him from Duke's Landing, one of [our hubs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157621643139200/show/) (though more of a storage depot in this chapter).

One of the dudes at R2D2 (Right To Dream Too) said "you can take my picture: I'm native American but I not one of those who believes your camera will take my soul".  "Only two thirds of it" I bantered, as I snapped [the shot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6367365031/in/photostream/).  Smile.  That was earlier today, while waiting for Tara.

Tom:  the general uses everything, the artist makes do with nothing.  A sense of self is a temporary matrix holding all together, both convergent / divergent.  When narrowly focused, as in a trance, we may lose perspective on what our role may be, in the bigger picture.

Apparently the camera was not recording, so the performance has vanished into our brains and blogs as it were.

The audience was engaged and nurtured I thought.

Silverton was a hoot.  I thought of contacting [Gus](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/global-warming.html) but we were there for such a short time, hanging out at one of the main downtown watering holes (after dropping Tara at Silverton High).  We enjoyed two appetizers, a couple drinks, and shoved off, back to Portland (a hub or "base") and Esozone.

Off to a food pod for some occufood next, probably the one at the base of Hawthorne, near Lucky Lab, where I am now, by way of Helium across the street.
