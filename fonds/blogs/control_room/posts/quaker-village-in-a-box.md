Just add water... (smiley).

I'm mixing [DemocracyLab](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/06/democraylab.html) memes with [The Village (movie review)](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/village-movie-review.html) and coming up with this high tech "[reality show](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/prototyping-with-reality-tv.html)" (reality, but shared in media) that comes with [a software ecosystem](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/08/graph-databases.html) and operating manuals, plus lots of DIY instructions for [setting things up](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/01/repatriation-facilities.html).

The community may not be autonomous or self sustaining in the larger sense, as we're all "solar surfers", but might still be [somewhat remote](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/12/more-xrl-in-bhutan.html) and [a place to restart](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/usa-os.html) in some ways, for some folks.

Yes, there's a bit of [WestWorld](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070909/) in this vision (with [Yul Brynner](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/03/magic-christian-movie-review.html)).
