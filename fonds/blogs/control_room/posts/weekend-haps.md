LH, a phys ed chief, back from NIH gig in DC, met up with some top regional talent re shunting CRRs back to HQS for [GIS services](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/gis-2009.html) etc.  Mapping diabetes two correlated with fast food establishment density will prove revealing I bet, in service of [medical science](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/slow-food-nation.html).  Thx for update re Tacoma, Women's Rights museum, buying lunch for chauffeur.

Left her Fast Food Nation [for review](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/11/fast-food-nation-movie-review.html).

[RR](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/design-scientist-ron-resch.html) sent half gig easter egg PDF flipbook, while my one free sample got turned into [some glorious Python](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-May/009351.html) by GL, our Viennese turtle keeper.  Ron is an effing genius I'm thinking.  Glenn and I hope to support PPS with first dibs and sneak peeks on a lotta stuff, ISEPP willing (he's an ISEPP senior fellow, also [CSN CSO](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/)).

CHR did a 3-day training in inter-cultural competence, can never have too much of that I agree.  Sent her CCs of my Sociality writings for analysis (or not).

Fine Grind kicked off a new art show, continuing proud traditions.  Our CFO picked the right team.  Andrew's gear statues (which Tara adores) front and center, [Andrew](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/storyboarding-tomorrow.html) himself off to Spain for a spell (looking forward to [travelogue](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/travel-bar.html)).

Eating ice cream today, celebrating making it to 51 (lots of up hill). Been shooting around my 14 mile loop on Tinkerbell some, aiming for 52.  Looking forward.
