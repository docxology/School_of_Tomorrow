An AFL/CIO canvasser just came to my door, working the neighborhood.  I shared some of my worries about finding people with "the right stuff", echoing some recent correspondence with other math teachers:We know K-12 is terribly broken and is in the control of know-nothings, but there's nothing much we can do about it except take jobs overseas. Obama wants to punish us for doing that, whereas I say let him deliver that "world class education" he promised, and start using FOSS on commodity hardware and throw out those stupid hamster-brained TIs...Out here on the Pacific Rim, we just can't afford to stay in the 1900s sucking our thumbs, although they're trying that in California, given that girly-man governor they've got.Of course that's just an insider joke about the Governor of California. I do tend to rant about calculators a lot, as a bottleneck in developing new curricula around [STEM subjects](http://www.stemedcoalition.org/) (cite [Chicago Talk, Pycon 2008](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/05/propagating-gnu-math.html)).My point:  in many cases, we're attempting to lure opportunities to our region, in areas where our candidates either [already match the job qualifications](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/10/head-hunting.html) in terms of skills, or would be affordably trainable.Like other developing economies, we seek long term investors, collaborators, partners in development.We're looking to bring jobs [from overseas](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/metropolitan-talk.html), not keep them from leaving i.e. they're not here to begin with.
