Cambridge Analytica, a UK-based psyops firm, with state of the art 
algorithms, tricks Facebook into divulging the data of millions (for 
which it now [faces fines](https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/facebook-cambridge-analytica.html)). Bannon is vice president, working closely 
with Trump. [ Cambridge Analytica](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/02/keeping-tabs.html) has meddled in the foreign affairs of 
other countries as well.  It's one of these new technology PR = covert 
ops manipulation companies.

The dupe Americans, though told this story (free press!) are Pavlovian creatures, trained to snarl and show
 fangs when Russians are mentioned, but flip over and show their cute 
tummies if ever a Brit needs a pet.  So even though Trump overtly 
colluded with a foreign power, the FBI carefully said nothing about it. 
 The story was 100% redacted from the Mueller report.

Congratulations Americans!  You've fooled yourselves again.  Lincoln was right about you (before the Brits had him snuffed).
