My vision of the world rallying to the needs of the besieged in Gaza and setting up an evacuation flotilla was counter what borders are all about: restricting freedom of movement, penning people in, subjecting them to the authority of whomever happens to be exercising jurisdiction over whatever region they happen to be trapped in.

In the SimU game, campuses dot the globe and students, faculty, admins flit about more freely, engaged in work-study. The question "where are you from?" is considered fairly bogus, unless it means "where were you born?". Obviously we're all from Planet Earth and each of us wanders its surface to some degree.

I wouldn't expect any top down "world government" to take care of these movements. Migration patterns are not always subject to tight regulation by bureaucracies. On the other hand, campuses with liberal intake policies may nevertheless be able to track enrollees. I'm able to write science fiction about it all, drawing from existing patterns.

You'll find people deliberately confusing "genocide" with "ethnic cleansing" all the time, because they don't want to think too hard. Nor is ethnicity a static attribute. If your ethnic group has been bombed or otherwise attacked by another one, that tends to change your ethnicity. 

You may now have a permanent grudge, an ax to grind, that you didn't have before. Or perhaps your ethnicity is about not carrying grudges. Your discipline is about working through negative emotions and finding ways to transform them. A lot depends on what anchoring religions and/or metaphysical disciplines you want governing your life, which preferences change with time, as possibilities are revealed.

I still envision mixed-use skyscrapers and other buildings, some of which identify as New Palestine University (NPU) or simply Palestine, but it's more a corporate logo than a national flag, in the sense that no contiguous boundary around a large geographical region is presumed. Diaspora nations (the best kind) dot the world with assets. 

Contiguous boundaries have mostly been replaced with credentials and access to specific goods and services, specific facilities, such as on a US military base in the Philippines, and/or through a university.

Am I saying I'm a practitioner of "zionetics" or one of those, meaning I'm eager to cleanse Palestine of Palestinians?  No. All these ethnicities are already globally distributed. I don't have to lift a finger. 

Let Palestinians come and go as they please, via Palestinian Airlines or whatever. But with an early emphasis on "go" i.e. to get away from toxic neighbors. Return when the neighborhood improves? It's up to individuals, unless they break too many rules. Banishment remains a practice.

I'm free, as an American, to laugh at the Louisiana Purchase as the science fiction it was and is. I'm free to make light of ethnicities that take the idea of nation states so uber seriously, or that believe in "races" at the cost of sacrificing an ability to think globally. I don't have to brainwash myself the same way they do, nor am I compelled to respect their choices, as many Jews and/or Christians and/or Muslims etc. likewise do not.

My ethnicity also doesn't feel compelled to always agree that "space is 3D" even if we're well-versed in that metaphysics. We have our own namespaces. That's in part how we bond. Given telecommunications, we don't feel compelled to all move to the same base in Arizona or Utah or whatever. We might build a school in Gaza, perhaps near to a McDonald's or a Vkusno i Tochka, the way schools are in Oregon (next to fast food joints).
