[OVERVIEW](http://vimeo.com/55073825) from [Planetary Collective](http://vimeo.com/planetarycollective) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/).

Ever since Walter Kaufmann translated Nietzsche's "Übermensch" to "Overman" 
instead of "[Superman](http://www.dccomics.com/superman)", there's been discomfort among Quaker Overseers, 
who are caught in the hard place of remaining vigilant against 
undermining / subverting influences (cosmetics, music...) that might 
distract Friends from expectant waiting on the spirit.

Quakers don't believe in titles or, more accurately, different ranks or classes
 of human. Fox was popular among infantry and officers for his direct 
egalitarian manner and plainspokenness, direct speech, an asset in war 
time.  Quakers  wouldn't treat some as uber-entitled and others as 
trash, which got them in trouble (an understatement).

However, Kaufmann's whole schtick (or a big part of it) was to put distance 
between "Übermensch" and any stupid Nazi ideas of Arayan supremacy, the 
ultimate classism or sense of entitlement.

Friends tried hard to put the brakes on WW2 (see [Human Smoke](http://www.amazon.com/Human-Smoke-Beginnings-World-Civilization/dp/1416572465)) by seeing 
Germans as humans too ([like Americans](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/philosophy-101.html), far from perfect); they resisted 
imposition of the food blockade, the siege Churchill had mounted and 
needed FDR to support, and they pushed to open borders to fleeing / 
desperate refugees from Nazi oppression, Jews chief among them.

DC Comics might have had the better translation after all, in that 
ordinary powers we have, as humans further along the timeline, are 
"super" compared to what they were until recently.  We fly places.  We 
Google stuff.  We see the Earth from space.

Compared to humans just a short time ago, in terms of environmental impact at 
the terraforming level, for better or for worse (or neither or both), 
we're now "super" or "uber" or "on steroids" if you will ("over the 
top", "hyper", "amped up").

Nietzsche
 was right:  humanity was about to go into overdrive and into orbit and 
now we have "overview" (Über-view) from space.  We see the fragility of 
our situation.  That's what our new superpowers (powers of oversight) 
help us realize: that we're uber-vulnerable, as a ball-shaped ecosystem 
in the middle of nowhere.
