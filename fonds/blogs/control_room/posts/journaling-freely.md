One would imagine a city of screenwriters like LA could work backwards from our wanting that mixed use floor space in office towers yesterday. Does that mean remodeling every floor into apartments? Does it mean hauling a sleeping bag to your office? How about a cot?  Where does a family find its privacy barriers?

The Zoom revolution helped, and was coming with or without covid, but yes, the sars2 virus helped catalyze killing the commute for many a "cube farmer", planners know this.

What's needed are high functioning managers who know how to work with others from the inside out, as resident advisers. We used to call them community organizers, but the stereotypes there exclude most business sector talent. 

What holds these groups together is less a religion and more an economics theory, such as GST, which is personal workspace centric and conversant with "global university" networking.  Such "faculty" will be among the first "boots on the ground" in the back rooms or liminal spaces of virtual community formation. 

Not everyone is cut out for such work, to state the obvious, and when it comes to drug rehab, lets admit that outdoor settings are oft preferred. 

Getting penned up with people undergoing withdrawal is impractical. This isn't prison we're talking about.

Deke the Geek has been studying UIs forever, so you might think we'd have the knowledge engineering dashboards by now, but he's not sufficiently integrated within campus circuitry / security. 

The programming curriculum is a joke, I say as an insider, because it's starving the right brain, even if you don't believe right brains might be starved, or what the consequences might be for doing so. Nevertheless, the hegemony of the lexical lefties is sometimes palpably oppressive. 

We need more of a movie industry around all the good stuff happening in human services, made by the humans served.

For readers just joining us, you won't have the context of QuarterWorld style gamification floors where we experiment with those alternative curricula y'all have been sending us, at least in idea form. I'd get first dibs at the trough sometimes, meaning I'd be one of the first to promote it if I thought it worthy. 

Who knows what the world might have been like, had Strange Attractors seen the light of day (a toy I worked on, and which got as far as a shrink wrapped box).

Deke would still need to drive around and recruit for these shelters, by which I mean these former office towers downtown, some of which have suitable facilities for these different levels of refugee. We have the local clientele, and we have the more globally routed. 

Portland has long served as a refugee resettlement business, with my place of employment (CUE) providing some of the framework. A lot of my Palestinian connections trace to that chapter, adding to my already robust ties to the Jewish community, although I admit to not knowing many Israelis (I've not visited since the 1970s, and by now it's a different country they tell me).

Portland needs to experiment with various levels of world livingry service industry logistical assistance, as I've been brainstorming as a kind of "outdoor Ikea" around the Port Authority somewhere, I thought Dignity Village might be eager to branch out. 

NGOs and prototyping go together. I called it Project Renaissance, but NATO took things in a different direction. I chalk that up to cultural illiteracy. 

Some people in government have less than a high school level education, when you factor in what [real] high school looks like in the 2020s. Adults need it badly, as much or more than the teens. 

Boomers who didn't get lucky with Bucky the first time (almost all of them) deserve another crack at the synergetic singularity, a boat they've hitherto missed, no thanks to the hypercross dogmatists.
