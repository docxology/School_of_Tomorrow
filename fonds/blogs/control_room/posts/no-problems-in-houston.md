I'm watching a flatscreen in the Houston airport, seeing [exDCI Gates](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/making-waves-in-dc.html) ('91-'93) is replacing Rumsfeld @ DoD -- watching GWB spar with the press.My seat mate on the plane had overview brokering architectural services, e.g. to a BBQ selling chain. CNN had an interesting Life in a Box feature about a design firm recycling shipping containers into homes and offices -- reminded me of Cape Town, that school we visited.Houston's airport makes me appreciate PDX's no hassles free wireless. Here I'm being nickle and dimed, still the norm in most USA airports. Dawn and I are sharing a Wendys burger, Frostieâ„¢ and fries. They didn't sit next to me because of the Exit Row stipulations (I really appreciated the extra leg room). Inflight movie: [Little Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430304/) (goo goo).Is [Synergetics](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/) really a philosophy then?  That's what I tell people, who ask [what I'm teaching on Synergeo](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/30487) these days.
