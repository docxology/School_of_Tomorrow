 From emailed response:  Advanced
 practitioners of world religions should organize co-venture brands e.g.
 an official JewBu temple (or franchise), then something 
Islamo-Catholic.

With the right architects, it could be done.Then
 the services would be deliberate / designed blends as well. Minaret 
calls to prayer, allusions to the Tower of Babel (one of my faves). Lots
 of incense.

Islamo-Catholic
 facility could be around appreciation for science, astronomy in 
particular (Vatican has official observatory), the fact that Arabic 
languages saved Greek knowledge during
 Dark Ages in Europe.  These could be themes of a Christian-Islamic 
friendship enterprise, one of many collaborative undertakings the world 
religions could be designing.  The world could use more Parliament of 
World Religions type "getting along" (not just "tolerating" which is a 
low standard).
