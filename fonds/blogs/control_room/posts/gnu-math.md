This is a pun on "new math" (aka [SMSG](http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/00284/cah-00284.html)), developed within the cold war context to prod more Americans into a space age frame of mind. The Russians had launched Sputnik and paranoia was running high.[GNU](http://www.fsf.org/) = GNU's Not Unix, Richard Stallman's coin for a Unix-like command line environment, coded from scratch.  [Gnu Math](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-March/006013.html) integrates mathematics with a command line aesthetic, providing [future Morlocks](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html) with tools of the trade.For example, [Pythonic Mathematics](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2005-July/005025.html) integrates algebra with OOP (the object oriented paradigm), a basis for many of our world game's models and simulations. The USG first got behind Python with its [DARPA](http://www.darpa.mil/) funding of Guido's [CP4E initiative](http://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e.html).The civilian public education system was slow to catch on however, given the ideological priorities of a [parasitical political machinery](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html), which used the spectre of terrorism to keep Americans in a state of fear.The Internet, also originally military, helped Americans develop antibodies to this parasitical ideology.Thanks to [the Internet](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4586024), Gnu Math continued to make inroads, assisting the engineering community in its efforts to debug and restore integrity to a corrupted USA system.
