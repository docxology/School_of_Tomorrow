:: halloween 2011 ::

A high point of Halloween [the-day-itself](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/10/halloween-2011-1-of-3.html) was getting to tour the basement apartment Glenn and Barry have been working on for so many weeks.  Barry is really good with dry wall and does measurements to 1/16th of an inch.  There's no texturing to speak of, as there's nothing to cover up.  This is craftsmanship beyond what you would get from most contractors, was Glenn's assessment, and as a craftsman himself, he's in a position to know.

Earlier, Glenn and I took Sarah-the-dog to Laurelhurst park.  I forgot to take a baggie again, like that time walking with [Officer Bader](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/10/busy-friday.html).  

Fortunately, a McDonald's cup lay nearby, thoughtlessly dropped by a shopper-consumer ([I don't call them "capitalists"](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/10/fun-center-opdx.html) usually).  Sarah went again at the park, where a nice lady had bags to give out, and a male version of Sarah into sniff testing (that's [dogs](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/do-arabs-hate-dogs.html) for ya).  

The Laurelhurst Park lake has been remodeled to positive effect.  You can see the bottom even.  I wouldn't call it "stimulus money" as it's just a day in the life of [a city that works](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/workaday-world.html), to do maintenance and upkeep.

Wow, some of the [Halloween displays](http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/browse_thread/thread/3c97f77c932d64e2?hl=en) are really professional this year, like direct from Hollywood or something.

Sara (Cera) and Satya stopped by, enroute to practice, just as I was shutting off the porch light, now that we were drained of candy (Kit-Kats mostly).  We had a dry not-windy night, couldn't ask for much better. 

People had a good time.  Satya likes the carving part, noted the 3rd eye in our latest work.  

I did office work through some of the candy part, which isn't entirely asocial, as there's Skype and the cool people I'm on with for work.  [Tim Curry](http://youtu.be/PUhuPn8_d0Q) and [Jim Carrey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBWkPRSE-W4) have more in common than I'd realized.

Sara had trailered my lentil dish to OPDX, our to-the-second intersection occurring in the middle of 28th, as the crew departed [the community kitchen](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/halloween-2011-2-of-3.html) for the FNB booth in South Park (downtown ToonTown).

Tara and I consider Halloween probably our main holiday of the year.  This was a good one.  She got children, boys, bike rides, movies, pie, cooking, family time with me and grandma Carol (Bagdad celebration).  Sara got to meet her for the first time, albeit in a hurried way in the night, bike lights flashing.

Synergeo has been [a lot about lentils](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/67219), and now this "[dymaxion tesseract](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/67285)", which is really no more than another teaching toy.  The Russian Dolls motif is becoming important, for David Koski too.

The meetup with Trevor the night before had been an eye-opener once again.  Tom Ellard eh?  The brilliant artist-musician.  One the of links I shared on Skype was this hilarious one, which Tom might take down at any time, wherein two Protestants pray for the soul of this middle American. You can tell they're American by [the shape of their heads](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/american-look-movie-review.html).
