After watching a few motivational Youtubes about Neo4j, which I'd [been playing with](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/graphing-relationships.html) using the default Movies tutorial, [py2neo](http://nigelsmall.com/py2neo/) just started working as advertised.

What I'm still not clear on is where this data persists, and will Tom Hanks come floating to the surface, [some castaway](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/04/castaway-movie-allusion.html), perhaps lost in our [Quaker terminal](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/terminal-movie-review.html)?

The "4j" should be seen as meaning "for Java" i.e. Neo4j targets the JVM, as do [Scala](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/07/scala-tutorial-at-oscon.html) and [Clojure](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/07/oscon-2014-tutorials-day-1.html).  No matter:  the C-family of Pythons have an API to the engine, just as they have the standard DB API for talking to SQL engines.

Neo4j, in being an open source graph database, is "not SQL" or "~SQL" per the graphic below, aimed at elucidating Model, View, Controller architecture in the form of a web application.
