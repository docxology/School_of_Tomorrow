OK, I'm glad Hillary Clinton is in the running, as that'll give us a chance to refocus on the [bombing of Belgrade](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/in-quandary.html).

Starting a hot war in the Balkans seemed the height of reckless stupidity to me, but I'm not sure the national security team of that era takes any responsibility for letting that situation get so out of hand.

I ate at lunch at Toney Bento's today, in honor of the Kosovar Relief Effort (Mercy Corps et al, likewise on the front line in Beirut).

Almost as reckless as another hot war in the Middle East, but I'm not sure George Bush could've stopped it, given [Unconscious America](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/team-america-world-police-movie-review_04.html), so best to put a bright face on it then. Either way, it's a referendum on war, and political dabblers therein.

And besides, I've already announced my bias against anyone with 109th Congress experience, so I'm not expecting any overtures. I'm glad to see Richardson entering the fray. Governors seem more even keeled to me. Congress has been quite "special" of late ([Church Lady](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_Lady) allusion).

I noticed the surface of Surface has this geek chic looking guy with some mutant tetrahedrons, a sign of the times. Prepare for another invasion of Beautiful Peopleâ„¢.
