I went by Fine Grind today to show Joe the pictures I'd snapped of his artworks [at Lizard Lounge](http://www.lizardloungepdx.com/).  Tag and I checked it out a few days ago.  This is mostly a retail outlet for clothing and accessories, but offers coffee and a couple workstations.  Blending in some art gallery motifs works well in this ambiance.My other work at FG was to set up a developer's workbench vis-a-vis VPython and [document some of the steps on edu-sig](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-September/009530.html).  Those of you following my curriculum writing know that I put a lot of stress on [the VPython add-on](http://www.vpython.org/), which bridges Python to OpenGL in a manner friendly to ordinary mortals who just want a simple API for real time spatial renditions.Over on Synergeo, I've been consolidating some of the gains we've made around the T, E and K modules and their respective rhombic triacontahedra of volumes 5, 5+ and 7.5 respectively.  Of course these values are in tetravolumes, a feature of [this Portland ethnomathematics I share ](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/practicing-multiculturalism.html)through [Coffee Shops Network](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/), Esozone, Saturday Academy and [other places](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/08/education-planning.html).  We're training a next generation of advertiser... designer.The title of this post refers to the venue from which I'm posting.  After a long day in service of my country, it's great to get some R&R listening to a favorite vocalist and friend who also happens to be a talented rock star.  Life is good sometimes.  The set is over now.  Lindsey is having some well deserved beer and pizza with the newest fans -- all guys here tonight, with a mix of passers by checking us out through the window.  She's talking [solidarity with the soldiers](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/repatriation.html), other policies (yes, I'm eavesdropping).I've been working on this Starling / System76 since 8 PM, still have up to an hour of battery life.  I'm so far pleased with this netbook, although it doesn't let me get away with being as ham handed as I'm used to.
