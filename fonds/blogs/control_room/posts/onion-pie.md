[Steve Holden](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/11/wanderers-20141113.html) is a pretty good chef and blogs have traditionally kept recipes.  I only have one so far, for [a lentil dish](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/together-friends.html).  Here's another:

Take six pounds of onions, and chop off tips, skin outer layer, halve, then slice with cross-section laying flat.

Add to large sauce pan with stick of butter and steam over medium heat until cooked down and flavorful, about 25 minutes.  Preheat oven to 425F.

Add to onions:  four slices (rashers) of sliced bacon, sauteed; pint of sour cream; two heaping tablespoons flour; salt; pepper, four eggs lightly whipped to blend yokes.

Fill pie shells and bake for about 45 minutes to an hour, until golden brown.

Extra filling may go in portion-sized bowls.
