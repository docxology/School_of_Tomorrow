These foreshadowed the [world dominating types](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/cywar-in-cyberia.html) who came to fame later ([Stallman](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/whiteboard-doodles.html), Torvalds et al), while also inspiring the young Werner Erhard to develop his est, a training I've written about in these blogs before, having [followed Walter Kaufmann](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/superman-returns-movie-review.html) in doing it, then tracking over to Bucky (e.g. [at Madison Square Garden](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/12/doing-less-with-more.html), read about it in a magazine), a shared point of fascination for both me 'n Erhard.An "est person" wasn't necessarily rich I don't think (I admit to not reading the book yet) but had a code of ethics one might characterize as philanthropic, loyal to humans.  That was a theme in est: going from disloyalty to loyalty towards being human was a feasible outcome and was discussed explicitly (philosophically).  Misanthropists might reform, which doesn't mean transform into secular humanists necessarily, like I stayed a Quaker throughout the process, while others stayed with other stuff.  This wasn't a swap meet, where you got to trade stuff a lot (mostly the trainer got the floor, though it mostly wasn't a monologue -- except when it was).Who gets the luxury to study these stories anyway?  I wish my journalism was better compensated (sigh), if that's what we call this.  Quakers keep journals by tradition and in this day and age, that means keeping a journal on-line if you dare (many do).So by that thinking, I really shouldn't be peddling my blogs as a source of income (it's a religious practice).  Hire me to train your teachers, is what I suggest, or let 'em test out (not saying I'm a gatekeeper so much as an efficient communicator of some basics worth sharing with others).  That's what I was doing in Chicago this year, [delivering a workshop](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/urner-workshop.html) at a Pycon.  I don't know if I'll make it to the one in Singapore but given cyberspace and our new way of doing posters (thanks to Vern Ceder, Steve Holden et al), I think that's a matter of secondary importance.What happened to [the old IS](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/08/lookin-good.html) in Makati then?  Did they tear it down? (Yakking about Manila again).
