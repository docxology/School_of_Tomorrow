I barged in late, having had business to attend to, arriving to a table surrounded by ten aging men, now eleven.  Please pass the sake.I remembered Jeff's book, which he'd [left in our car](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/excellent-adventure.html).We're talking about storage batteries at the moment...Earlier the chatter focused on "Elena", that  [elvynchyk](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/09/tinkering-with-tink.html) who ostensibly blasted through Chernobyl on her motorcycle taking pictures, the consensus today being that's not how it happened.However, this being a story from Russia, which is really the cover story? Good for a laugh anyway. Potemkin Villages or whatever.[Effective art](http://www.kiddofspeed.com/) in any case, and cleverly packaged.Lots of Quaker business today, both over the Web and in person.Keith is showing and telling about an eight watt [PC Engines ALIX](http://www.pcengines.ch/alix.htm) with an [AES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) encryption chip, which he plans to employ as a router tasked with decrypting the VPNs he's using.It's time for some last minute shopping.
