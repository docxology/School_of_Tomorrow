Perhaps the hallmark of the "modern European nation" in terms of liberalism is 
it doesn't conceive of itself as being in orbit around (controlled by) 
any one ethnicity (whatever the one). 

Israel stands out as the hallmark 
ethnic state, and as such is the envy of many.  But
 then Israel is not in Europe and Saudi Arabia is just as ethnocentric 
in its own way (we should talk about Britain more). 

The American ideal 
is closest to having "race creed" etc. not matter on paper, even if in 
practice people are jerks. 

This is why any talk of "Ukraine for 
Ukrainians, make us be in Europe now!" sounds so oxymoronic.  The 
Europeans think:  "you must be civilized first, and treat the Russians 
as equals" to which the Ukrainians reply "wait, don't you hate the 
Russians too?" which to many is the clinching argument. 

What we need is
 more agreement on "totalitarianism is bad" (dystopian) without all the 
old branding.  We've outgrown the old comic books.

What I'd remind Ukrainians of is that we're ethnically Russian over here too, in America. 

Not only Russian, obviously. 

Lots of Ukes. Lots of Ruskies. 

We've learned to live together. 

Sometimes I think Euros falsely conclude, based on clown shows in DC and recycled NATO propaganda, that America is foundationally Russophobic. To those with such a shallow understanding I'd say: keep digging. History is more complicated than good versus bad. 

If you moralize a lot (or too quickly?), consider you might be a dummy.
