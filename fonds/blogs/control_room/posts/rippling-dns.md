I repointed my [4dsolutions.net](http://www.4dsolutions.net/) to some new domain name servers, making them the [veridical](http://www.answers.com/veridical&r=67) authorities regarding the hostname and IP number of the hosted archive.In sum:  I jumped free of [jumpline.com](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/08/show-and-tell.html), landing on some Dual Xeon at a datacenter in Houston, Texas.  The move took under 24 hours.[My .py files](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/) @ [Oregon Curriculum Network](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/) are once again popping source code, thanks to a documented AddHandler in the appropriate .htaccess file. I even got the [geoquiz](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/geoquiz.html) working again (uses MySQLdb in the context of Pythonic cgi scripts).
