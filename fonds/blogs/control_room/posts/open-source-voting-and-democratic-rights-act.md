Notice that the whole [issue](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/open-source-voting.html) of cleverly crafted, laced-with-cheats software (not to mention hardware) is strategically on the sidelines at the moment, as we careen towards a next election.If journalism were able to sustain policy-making, that's a discussion we'd be having right now, but journalism can't do that job, isn't designed to, and nor is it the private sector's problem, really.Attending to the affairs of infrastructure, especially those of the core [operating system](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/usa-os.html) (the very machinery of voting for example) is the responsibility of government, otherwise there's no reason to pay for one.So I'm not taking the absence of serious public discussion of this issue as a symptom of corrupt journalism, so much as evidence of a hands-off philosophy towards government in general, on the part of those officially installed with the responsibility to manage it.Congress, in other words, if we are going to see any relevant legislation, an Open Source Voting and Democratic Rights Act for example, or something of the sort -- a sort of HIPAA in-reverse, in that the public has a right to know some information, just as surely as other information is none of its damn business.Great legislation isn't written by the shallow puppets of those who don't really believe in good government, who in their heart of hearts want it to go away -- so they can steal us all blind.Let us pray that those entrusted with the powers of political office will execute their duties with integrity, lest their words become as dust in the wind, against the forces of those who would seek to unseat [democracy](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-new-year.html), as a form of government, from its rightful place at the table.
