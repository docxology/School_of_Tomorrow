[Mark Frischmuth](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/10/wanderers-20071024.html) is giving us an update on developments around DemocracyLab.  Brandon, also present, is a code warrior for the project.  Expect more news soon.[Steve Holden](http://www.holdenweb.com/) is new in Portland.  He has been helpful since hopping off the airplane.  He solved the rear car door not unlocking problem (child proof feature, duh).  The drains are flowing more smoothly than they have in months.Steve is reassuring us that his peregrinations, frequent moves over the years, have not kept him from developing a sense of community.  He doesn't think electronics are able to replace community however.  We're a completely packed house tonight.  [Barbara](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/10/wanderers-2007102.html), [Patrick](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/03/wanderers-spring-retreat.html), [Lew](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/01/wanderers-20110126.html), [Dick](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/willamette-meteorite.html), [David](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/wanderers-2010914.html), [Bill](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/wanderers-2009715.html), [Jon](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/09/songs-in-study.html)... [Trish](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/wanderers-20101215.html). What is the open source philosophy?  Its goal is to develop common resources and infrastructure which you're free to tweak, mess with.  Costs may be driven down by sharing in the development of these assets.Steve didn't want to make this a long talk.  He gave us some biographical information, tried to locate himself on the geopolitical spectrum, made some thoughtful remarks, and then threw it open to discussion.The discussion got into patents and copyrights, whether academic work is open source, what benefits one might get from contributing to open source projects.  A lot of the people around the table have experience and connections in the open source ecosystem, so this was a fairly sophisticated discussion.  We mentioned Apache a lot.  I sat quietly, typing this blog post.[Exhibit](https://github.com/leonhandreke/fosdem):/* * -------------------------------------------------------- * "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42): * Adam Ziolkowski and Leon Handreke  * wrote this file.
