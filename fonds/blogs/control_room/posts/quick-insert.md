Before racing down to People's Climate March, I was thinking to [review ](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/09/el-topo-movie-review.html)[El Topo](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/09/el-topo-movie-review.html) ([Jodorowsky](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/09/jodorowskys-dune-movie-review.html) directing, and acting), however I'm under some time pressure.  September 21 is one of those circle your calendar type days.

I'm also cramming on [Category Theory](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?messageID=9601874) for notation buffs, though I might stay on the humanities side and say "analogy" or "metaphor" in place of "functor" given similarities in meaning. 

Talked to Chandler at meeting, wanna figure out which "island in the Willamette" he was yakking about.

Mt. Tabor is looking good.
