[ originally a social media conversation with architect John Driscoll ]

Interesting how Cybernetics 
(like Synergetics) became more twilight zone after these authors (Alan Turing,  John von Neuman, Ross Ashby, Norbert Weiner, and Herbert Simon, Stephen Wolfram). 

Like 
who champions this discipline today, or General Systems Theory for that 
matter, ala Kenneth Boulding et al? 

Did computer science get sidetracked
 somehow, in failing to come together with architecture?  In addition to
 individual buildings, are the plans for camps, colonies, communities 
(bases, villages, forts) i.e. multi-structure agglomerations that might 
or might not be planned. 

If planned, by what algorithms?  Fractal 
dimensions come in again.

In my science fiction 
development banking, truck stops play a big role, as hubs in a campus 
system, where citizen diplomats have opportunities for R&R, 
including for religious services and classes, eat, sleep, games, 
multi-functional. 

We have our standard image of what a truck stop looks
 like.A lot of people are expecting all that 
trucking to become automated, however I see a rapidly growing freeway 
system from deep inside China to the Indian Ocean and Europe.  Africa
 is planning more freeways.  We need more tourism as a lifestyle, including by 
working tours of duty, involving truck driving around the world. That would 
kill two [virtual] birds, as they say.  It's another way to 
see the world, while working, which we could consciously shape and 
design versus ignore as beneath our calling.Why not
 have Cybernetics and General Systems Theory both come alive with global
 trucking and inter-modal transportation a central theme, unifying 
maritime architecture with land-lubber architecture?
