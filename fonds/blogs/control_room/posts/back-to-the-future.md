I've flashed on the Nord Stream debacle a few times, saying it couldn't be the work of a great nation.  Not with a coverup.  If it were heroism, brag about it.  But if it's not, then slink around and act guilty.

So in that sense, my USA, as I was saying, was not behind such a thing.  But, Planet of the Apes style, we could nevertheless have Ollie North types with the keys to this or that meeting room.  I'm not saying people living in The District (aka City of Morons) weren't complicit.

So we would have to call such a cabal pro-Ukrainian right?  So that part of the yacht story would read correctly.  It wasn't the USA aka Uncle Sam, not seen since the 1980s and suspected a goner, if not making a comeback, so it must have been some pro-Ukrainian group.  Fine.

Whether they used a yacht or not, vs suckered the Norwegians into being the bad guys, time will tell.  Either way, the USA was not involved.  By definition.  There's no need to lie about what happened to protect the USA.  If there's lying happening, it's to protect some pro-Ukrainian group.
