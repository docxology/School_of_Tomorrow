We're bracing for a next attack, a round of sanctions maybe.  Like Canada, we're out from under, a Free State.

However saying they'll flood our cities with refugees (trial balloon) is less of a threat than they think.

We've had influxes before and know that higher ed has a role.  The difference between "camp" and "campus" is minute.  Yes, we enjoyed a friendlier Feds back then.

I worked with CUE, which started out under Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon.  For awhile, we were free flying, until refugees were no longer a priority.

This was in the aftermath of Nixon-Kissinger.

I taped a Youtube about our role, with some mention of past AFSC work.
