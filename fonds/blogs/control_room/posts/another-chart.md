From the Synergeo list (# 59600):

XYZ provides a "treatment" whereby all polyhedra will be smaller than their corresponding IVM values, per constant. Here's a chart, which includes [the] 2.8284... cube (XYZ treatment of Syn Cube of 3).

shapexyz volume in cubic units (cube diagonal is two units)ivm volume in tetrahedral units (tetrahedron edge is one unit)

Cubo. = cuboctahedron; Rt. = rhombic triacontahedron; Pd. = pentagonal dodecahedron; Rd. = rhombic dodecahedron; Ico. = icosahedron; Oct. = octahedron; Tet. = tetrahedron; Mite = minimum tetrahedron
