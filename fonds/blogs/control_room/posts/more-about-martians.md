presentation at NIST 

I've been on a CC or two with Istvan as I recall, as I was in communication with [Ed Applewhite](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/necker-cube-guy.html) about the time he wrote [The Naming of Buckminsterfullerene](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/eja1.html) for Chemical Intelligencer, which Dr. Hargittai edited.

I'm still taking this one in, about the Martians of Science, Istvan's name for his fellow Hungarians advising the Manhattan Project.

Me on Facebook: 

I
 remember when Edward Teller spoke at Princeton. Students hissed a lot. 
They do that at Princeton, like a viper pit or something, could be 
unsettling. They did the same thing with James Schlesinger as I recall, 
another GST guy. No hissing at Isaac Asimov's packed talk as I recall, 
nor at Nader's (an alum).

[General Systems Theory](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/general-systems-theory.html)

Certainly economists compete with one another to become stars in their own field, but the discipline as a whole still…

Given my interest in [Martian Math](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/12/more-core.html), with input from Applewhite, it makes sense that I'd be doing this homework.

Speaking of NIST, I've enjoyed a recent exchange with [Friend David Chandler](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/revisiting-911.html) on the awaited results of a next study (not by NIST, a peer review thing). NIST has findings of consequence for future building designers, given WTC7's structural failure from fires.  I'm following from a distance.
