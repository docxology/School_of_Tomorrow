:: Third Eye from porch of Anthology Books ::

Glenn and I enjoyed [Stan'wiches](http://www.yelp.com/biz/stanwiches-portland?osq=stanich%27s) today.  From our point of view it's El Dobre, the Polish place, but that name might have confused the public.  Either way, the food has been excellent and we loved the meatloaf pizza this afternoon.

We were watching them repaint Headlandia, which I gather Nomad Crossing owns, along with Vapelandia down the street.  Third Eye is adjacent and is somewhat the grandaddy on the block.  Linus Pauling House:  directly across.

I imagined the Pauling House fascia boards in a Bhutanese style.  The Newar temple, where Lindsey trained, is around the corner.

The economy is [shifting gears here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/15181102526/) given hemp is making a comeback, industrially, for fabric, as well as the medicinal brands.

Adjacent to Linus Pauling House:  Anthology Books.  Quite a collection.  I bought a first person narrative about adventures in the Himalayas, for $6.

Glenn and I went in and talked with Gary.  We're all looking forward to the Equinox coming up, which we'll celebrate on Friday the 19th, [a little early](http://www.theepochtimes.com/n3/945234-fall-equinox-2014-time-date-and-definition-for-autumnal-equinox/).
