The gamer community is always 
needing to create new ad hoc cities with detailed buildings, in multiple
 styles. Any help with generative algorithms could be a big hit.  I'm
 likewise seeking to blend Burning Man type "tribal centers" 
(experimental prototypes) into networked Country Faire vistas, suitable 
for year around camping in some cases.  Lots of food trucks / carts / 
pods ala Portland, mix of tents big and small (fractal), also domes big 
and small (a kind of tent, or yurt).Creating these vistas on computer, for fly through, gives the script more traction with would-be producers.

I've been talking with John Driscoll
 an architecture student about the building and city generation 
algorithms used for games and potentially reality planning.Â 

I'm thinking
 Refugee Science will prove an imaginative theme park motif actually 
adds to camp prosperity, cuts down on crime. This might be in the 
vicinity of some truck stop such that supplies and transportation are in
 golf cart distance (light rail?), but the village itself is mostly 
geared for pedestrians, Disneyland style.
