With the Freedom Toaster, artists will now be able to obtain the tools and other materials needed for their work, irregardless of their Internet connectivity and for free.”Or, if it's not specifically music that interests you, but computers more generally, the Freedom Toaster is potentially a goldmine of legally [free assets](http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/10065) and information.  Just make your selections, insert your CDs, and burn.  Get what might take days to download, in just minutes.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgq8Y7NK-Y5LikcMgdTJDb1pOycGDR9OMCUq480pf2fRorP2mzvQRqDWgmMpH9Uz21qmStEc-BBLQQaoRaoR76iDM5alBPh5EfZiKuM4llre71RGvKK8Oz2TR82aSHp9l_pndfG/s1600-h/revolution.jpg)The Shuttleworth FoundationRepublic of South Africa
