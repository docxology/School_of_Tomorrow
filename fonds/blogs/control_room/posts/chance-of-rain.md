One of the most light hearted autobiographies I ever encountered was at a nearby [coffee shop](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/school-business.html) with this name.  I don't know if it still has that bookish look any more (a passing phase), plus I know it no longer shows those [Governor Schwarzenegger](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008154/) movies.  Anyway, Salvador Dali's. Check it out sometime.Wanderers:  Barry is describing pre-WWII banking situations, leaving some guy to sleep it off in the vault.I came in late, giving a heads up about another four-legged Wanderer candidate that might join us briefly.  It's my practice to include [non-humans](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/solstice-party-wanderers.html) in our gatherings.We shall see.  We also discussed  fund accounting, vs. the more usual for-profit kind (DWA's specialty, and TBC's, is/was the former type of bookkeeping, used by many a 501(c)(3)).We then broke out into some full blown kabbalah type conversation, lots of Hebrew letters (more unicode fun), [thanks to Milt](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/wanderers-2006830.html) and his invited guest Ken.  The Mayan and Wiccan calendars also received significant attention from the other end of the table.  Portland is just like that.I name dropped [Stan Tenen](http://www.meru.org/) but otherwise didn't have much to offer in this department.  I've never read much [Suarez](http://psyche.com/), given all that time squandered on [Synergetics](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/synergetics.html) (plus R&R).The dog was beautiful. My sincere thanks to her handlers for sharing her with us.
