[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5249569007/)I explained to [Satya](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/01/economics-of-happiness-movie-review.html) this morning that I thought Lindsey [really did her homework](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/01/fnb-2010113.html) getting to know Friends, myself included, and that proved a strong basis for anchoring Thursday's kitchen for a year's worth of fresh vegan Food Not Bombs meals.  I'm not ready to promote anyone else to her position, as trusted key holder, from within the ranks at this time.  Now that Organics to You has [moved to N. Williams](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/08/fnb-2011811.html), we thought this would be the right time to drop our weekly gig.We both remain interested in [the logistics of increasing participation](https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/nefoodnotbombs/2011-09/msg00012.html) in these kinds of intelligent operations.  Neither of us plans to come off as over-zealous however.  As a street musician these days, she's in no position to preach.  I'm more [a back office boob](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/stress-tests.html) myself, am no Alex Jones with a bullhorn.This disconnecting of our Multnomah Friends kitchen doesn't mean OTY can't continue to help feeding the hungry in southeast, as both OTY and the northeast chapter have made abundantly clear.  Indeed, several of our regulars hail from northerly zip codes and could replace Lindsey as haulers (she was thinking of Jay in particular).She enjoys hauling herself, leaving the meetinghouse today with an [humongous train of trailers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6131324429/in/photostream/), after visiting OTY and bidding them adieu for the time being.In this next chapter, we may find ourselves performing new roles.  Even the meetinghouse, a kind of learning center, will remain on-line in some ways.  We continue with our various social concerns and campaigns (testimonies).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhTfAbKOF2_pw8GMEeyGQ8xXNlaAwKLmdKxoiYkO_rRJ7-3Q4l1zaaGrixj6CKIc-lak5k4u5yd6qWu35H2AIKEYUlXnM4zjib4aq3XNtcim9g_uKQ3abZTmpRgZwhLjH8FeCr_/s1600/blue_house_irc.png)#pdxfnb on freenode
