This YouTube [since removed] of Kraftwerk was experienced live by Trevor, in Seattle.  The music was so loud his clothes rattled, definitely ear plug territory:

This second video is little branding gig for the [Y2K](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-music-millenium-notes.html) World's Fair in Hannover, Germany:

Trevor and I were in the Multnomah Meetinghouse today, returning a medical supply, plus I'd come through earlier for [adult education](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/quaker-preschool.html), missing M4W this time.

This is the same building we met in back in the early 1960s, soon after [ESI](http://www.esi.com/) transferred the property to AFSC and sponsors.

I connect Britney's [Piece of Me](http://youtu.be/u4FF6MpcsRw) to Kraftwerk because of the computery riff / refrain towards the end (2:06 - 2:24) -- "[very electronique](http://youtu.be/0HwFUE3rhfY)" as they say.  Trevor pointed out the moire pattern allusions (0:16, 1:42 - 2:05 etc.).
