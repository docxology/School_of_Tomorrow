We hear a lot about "nationalism" versus "globalism" these days. Probably the easiest way to sound patriotic is to decry globalism, which is roughly perceived as the doctrine (the "ism") of "the one percent" which in turn is shorthand for a much smaller percentage, i.e. not "one in a hundred" is an illuminatus or whatever.

"Colonialism" is highly out of fashion, but what is it, anyway? 

English is a bit slippery, y'all may have noticed. One may have a colony (in the sense of neighborhood) of mostly Urdu speaking Hindus, in this other surrounding culture, but there's no connotation that the colony is taking over. It's an enclave, perhaps a camp of visiting guest workers. 

One has such enclaves all over the world, otherwise known as resort hotels (for the more transient colonists).

That's right: both "colonist" and "colonialist" are defined. 

The former is doing it, whereas the latter is believing in it. 

The true believers are likely wanting to have more of a hand in steering the policies of the host country. 

A simple colonist is glad to have the host taking care of providing room service, other amenities. 

Hotel management is blissfully not hotel guest business.

Then you inevitably get a "spectrum" i.e. hotel guests that are nevertheless doing business with the hotel, by bringing together a conference in that venue. I was privy to this angle quite a bit, thanks to HoldenWeb and The Open Bastion, conference companies I got to hang with thanks to Steve Holden. His team produced Pycons, Djangocons, an ApacheCon or two, among others. I traveled to DC and Chicago for some of them.

I bring up hotels in part because they conventionally (pun intended) host whole colonies, some of which are semi-permanent or at least long lasting, such as in the case of employed workers. In the worker scenario, dormitory digs and workspace may be separated, which is where the "bedroom community" becomes an enclave. One has enclaves of embassy workers for example, a colony from nation X who staff their nation X embassy.

One also gets inter-colony interactions (e.g. Pythonista vs Perl Monger at an OSCON -- I greatly admired both communities), meaning a nation state such as Lesotho will host multiple enclaves associated with multiple embassies, engineering projects, religious establishments, other enterprises. Again, I'm writing from personal experience. 

Religious establishments are a great example, because it's often a religious practice to have one's personnel do tours of duty in distant lands, spreading the religion, sure (missionary work), but also bringing back intelligence and artifacts, potentially advantaging.

When a colonist gets in trouble with the host country, how is this handled? We see from the news that several patterns (templates) pop up in response to this question. Let's come back to this topic down the road.
