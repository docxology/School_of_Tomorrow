If you poke around in my blogs, you'll know I'm big into "citizen diplomacy". But what does that mean? Humans learning to be diplomatic took time. Diplomas had to be invented first, meaning universities. Instead of Universe, call it University why not?

Nowadays we have all these personal workspaces (PWSs) using Zoom every day, or perhaps they use other channels. Or they're recording straight to YouTube, via live stream or as completed, likely edited, projects. By this means, diplomacy proceeds, in the form of continual "attitude adjustments". 

If you're in an activist role, then "attitude" has to do with observation and orientation in an OODA loop sense. You'll be taking active measures based on updates to the cockpit (fighter jet talk). If you're passive, you may yet be following closely. These terms come with so many shades of meaning.  As a "passivist" you may feel you're studying for a more active role later.

Americans with relative expertise and education have more powers than before, thanks to the more evolved telecommunications infrastructure. We see the trend is really with respect to Earthians in general. Earth is still becoming more like America, but that doesn't mean "led by the Beltway Mafia" so much as "benefitting from unbridled communications".

The "motherboard" (if we might call it that -- think "the grapevine" if old school) is better able to keep pace with change, in a virtuous circle, to the extent we're all able to participate in the important business of being citizen diplomats. Or shall we say "layman diplomats"? To what extent is citizenship required, to travel the globe? Does every trucker crossing a border someplace have a passport?  Is every gypsy caravan "from a country"?

We've always had "the masses" and / or "public opinion", or have for a long time. The process of "manufacturing consent" might have been more top-down in an age before we all became "channelers" (in the sense of having a channel). 

Nowadays, the processing has to run deeper, and maybe for longer, but the outcomes are proportionally better anchored in real mindsets. Crummy propaganda becomes less effective in proportion to "influencers" becoming familiar with PR techniques. The audience (active and/or passive) has become so much more sophisticated.
