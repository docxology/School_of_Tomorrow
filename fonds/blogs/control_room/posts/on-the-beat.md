:: brooklyn basement ::

I was pleased to join Glenn around lunch time on his birthday, to chow down at Hopworks and then survey the Brooklyn Basement [once again](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/halloween-2011-3-of-3.html), a project he and Barry have been working on.

I zipped downtown on my bike last night, in case the new trainee showed up, and he did.  

I had the classic experience of getting a stranger to tell me his pet paranoia, what we're supposed to expect [at Occupy Portland](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/11/visiting-bizmo.html).  But later I grew suspicious ([more paranoid](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/10/psychiatry-today.html)) thinking this rant was too well rehearsed (what with that baby in his arms and everything), maybe an act?

[What's Crazy Mary again](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/wanderers-20111020.html)?  Or was this Monty Python in a parallel universe?

Anyway, he said [the chemtrails](http://chemcon.2020oregon.net/) were really a UN plot to replace the ozone which the 1% had destroyed (yet another coverup).  That's the thumbnail version (I'm leaving out the Surgeon General part).  When the misses showed up, he said she knew even more of the details, and oh, could I spare a trailer for when the meltdown comes (any day now).

That night, a trailer, SkyBlue, went missing.  Or was it later?  Sherlock Holmes is on the case.

So while Will took SkyBlue for a test drive behind his bike (he brought her back -- not a suspect; he was cooking today with the others), I yakked with David Koski on my cell about what appears to be [a new discovery](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/67456):

that the "two phi down" version of the rhombic triacontahedron of volume 7.5, which [interweaves with](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/01/storyboarding-lcds.html) the rhombic dodecahedron of volume 6, added to the octahedron-inscribed cuboctahedron of volume 2.5, gives that icosahedron (also inscribed in the volume 4 octahedron) used to introduce the S modules.

I was getting all this while roaming around Occupy Portland, and helping Will with the trailer hitch.  Pretty good multi-tasking I thought.  Then I biked home, [filed my FNB memo](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/67458), mentioning some that I'd met there (a light night; there's no organized serving from the FNB booth on Thursdays).

Carol is in Philly tonight.  Good to hear from Uncle Bill.  Looking ahead to Thanksgiving.
