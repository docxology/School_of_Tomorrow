You'd think [Global U](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html) doctoral candidates would be fanning out across the land to chronicle [the early history](http://grunch.net/synergetics/domes/domehist.html) of geodesic dome building, as this was the architectural breakthrough for which the 1900s will be remembered in large degree.

A lot of the early pioneers are still alive and willing to talk.  

Dick Lehr was [only just caught on tape](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/10/necessary-ruin-movie-review.html) before he died.  Other [key players](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/06/fuller-schoolers.html), such as with Synergetics Inc., TC Howard [chief among them](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/geodesichelp/ctWyVQMH4ao/O9hWh5s4E2cJ), may not have been taped yet, I don't know.  

David Koski and I have been looking into it.  Duncan Stuart is another one.  [Don Richter](http://grunch.net/snelson/snelpix1.html) of course. Jim Fitzgibbon, Jonathan Smith, Jeremy Martin... Thanks to John Braley for [some of this scholarship](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/26751). Edward Popko has been providing some puzzle pieces as well.

However, in so many ways [the Global U](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/03/campus-household.html) is broken and we get to live with the symptoms of that. 

Getting [a working curriculum](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/workaday-world.html) is a top priority and philanthropy will have a lot to do with revivifying various moribund circuits, many of them "between the ears" in popular consciousness.  

Or call it "connecting the dots".
