I taught [Python @ WHVN](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/winterhaven/) again today, focusing on nested data structures e.g. how to index into[ a dictionary of some USA and Canadian cities, each with lat/long coordinates expressed as a list of two 3-tuples](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/gis.py).  Here's [the worksheet we used](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/winterhaven/worksheets/urner_whvn_worksheet1.pdf) (PDF).[Kessler](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/02/back-in-portland.html) has his [Common Sense II pilot](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=491843388827305538) in Google Video, per my suggestion, bringing the count of[ Buckminster Fuller clips](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=%22Buckminster+Fuller%22) to five.   For a bigger stash, check the EIK site [defunct -- Feb 9, 09].Search results on [Polyhedron](http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=polyhedron)/Polyhedra within Google Video still returns zero, nada. Of course I could change that, but [I want to measure](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/morning-in-la.html) the [Ivory Tower's level of commitment](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/restoring-integrity.html) to supplying relevant open source geometry clips, sans my input (drumming fingers, twiddling thumbs).  [Princeton](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1347556)?  Anyone?Our USA military families are expected to fight and possibly die for their country, with kids expected to part with their parents, perhaps permanently, and yet what support do they receive in return, in the form of relevant education and training? Precious little. Their own [American history](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/octet-truss.html) and [heritage](http://www.medaloffreedom.com/RBuckminsterFuller.htm) is being denied them.So how is this not tyranny then?[Addendum, February 9, 2009:  up to about 372 Google Videos with "Polyhedra" in the title, 291 on YouTube]
