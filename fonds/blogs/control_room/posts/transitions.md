I huddled with parents of other prom goers.  We snapped our cameras furiously, capturing these precious moments.

I was happy to get to know these people better, even as we come to the end of a chapter. 

Then I drove to the pharmacy with only seconds to spare.

In my book it's not sinful to hate the suffering in this world.  In this case, hate is a kind of furious fighting back. 

A sword of compassion is a sword nonetheless.

A scenario, or time tunnel, is both a tunnel of sorrows, and a tunnel of joys.

Much sadness and grieving is with us at all times.

There is no need to paper over this reality.  Why waste energy in denial of what's real?

Joys are real also.
