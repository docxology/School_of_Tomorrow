The cosmic fishing process involves two major phases (not including maintenance and repair, getting to the site etc.): casting the net, pulling in the net. In more agricultural terms: we sew, we reap.The two essays linked below are integrative, consolidating.  I'm reaping, hauling in some fish.Essay 1:  [Forms of Life](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wittgenstein-dialognet/message/4959?source=1)Essay 2:  [Simple Language Games](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wittgenstein-dialognet/message/4965?source=1)Followup (March 17, 2005):Essay 3:  [Forms of Life (continued)](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wittgenstein-dialognet/message/4975)Essay 4:  [The Concentric Hierarchy](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2005-March/004520.html)The content is philosophical, but you need philosophy if your goal is to have a lot of overview. And here in the Control Room, overview is definitely what we're about.Applewhite expressed some satisfaction over my Fuller- Wittgenstein [bridge](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wittgenstein-dialognet/message/4966), a construction I talked over with Jay Baldwin at some length as well, that time we met in San Jose. Lots of positive synergies here.
