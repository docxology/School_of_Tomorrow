Mom and I joined other Portland politicos in packing The Bagdad for this radio-advertised [screencast](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399758/) about [Corporate Personhood](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/delinquent-dog.html) and related notions. Most seats were taken, right down to the front row. Radio talk show personality Thom Hartmann, and Lori Cheatle, the film's coproducer were present to host the event.You could tell people felt they were onto something, yet the issues dealt with are anything but simple, meaning it's a film that makes you think (all the more reason to show it somewhere kwel like The Bagdad -- I got my Hammerhead ™ during the Q&A).Yes, Nike discovered something about power signs, their catalyzing role in rolling out lifestyles. But it's not like others hadn't already put a spin on [Nike](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/temple-to-athena.html). Grabbing that ball from the sky: a bold move.And certainly Starbucks is going to get creamed in any fight over the right to blend Christmas, if playing the pro Russian Orthodox. Father Tryphon barely had to add sugar.And yes, big empty factories are an eyesore, and Harlem looks kinda stupid with too much plastic eye candy. She's sensitive to her own looks, and with that, I empathize.Kulture is too important to just waste, and yes, brand loyalty goes way deeper than skin sometimes.Nature's own balance works through this picture, and she's pretty unforgiving at times -- we want to be right by her, really, and she really hates to hurt humans, is my feeling about her. But couldn't they share more responsibly and not overmine that myth of "rich people" running everything?Humans like mini-me here just aren't totally in control OK? and no I'm not talking about "my bosses the ETs" (sheesh). I'm talking about Cybernetics 101. There's the Sun and the Moon and all that other stuff OK? So let's back off about "the rich people" 24 / 7 / 365, and give some just and due credit where credit is due: to Nature, who needs us to stay smart.Like, let's not go blaming Donald "you're fired" Trump for everything, nor any other poor slob, just because [life sucks](http://www.hotlyrics.net/lyrics/S/Sheryl_Crowe/Soak_Up_The_Sun.html) and the times are real bad. Even so, it's still a costume party, and behind the masks... are more masks (the running joke of such a festival).The [V for Vendetta](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/v-for-vendetta-movie-review.html) guy rips off his mask: "yes, 'twas I the Nasonex Bee™."In a lot of ways, the fast cut editing and interleaving with American icons, like Jim Hightower and Granny D, was a way of comforting us, as the vista is always changing, sometimes at a fast clip, and that's sometimes unsettling, yes.The rest of the world is feeling it too. Don't think any tucked away urbia is somehow immune from the butterfly effects of globalization. That's just your ecosystem at work. So remember to pace yourself.Our local Powell's Books has a Dalai Lama paper doll book (plus remember Think Different). Real American Eagles do soar in the Grand Canyon. We're all involved in branding these days.And there's a lot at stake, yes, however I don't think that UCLA brain professor has read enough Wittgenstein. The power of [Pepsi](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wittgenstein-dialognet/msearch?query=Pepsi&submit=Search&charset=ISO-8859-1) is not just that it registers higher in the right brain, but that it links to dear Michael Jackson in [Thriller](http://www.lyricsfreak.com/m/michael+jackson/thriller_20092727.html), a wonderfully bold production.Great art is not always for the feeble minded or weak at heart, might be the moral of this film. And Uncle Sam is a player, most definitely. That whole tea party thing? A branding issue.So don't count on Uncle Sam to make life easy for "idle rich" on the block, yet many rich are hard working, at least somewhat smart with their power -- including many of the liberals in this film, most of 'em quite rich by today's standards.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/Tote.png)
