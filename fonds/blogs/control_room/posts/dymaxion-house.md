My plan is to visit some coffee shop with Wifi and my copy of Cosmic Fishing, to re-read whatever [Ed Applewhite](http://grunch.net/archives/171) recounts about the Witchita, Kansas operation.

Then I'll flip through Bucky Works by J. Baldwin, which Ed liked a lot.

Trevor of [Synchronofile](http://synchronofile.com/) has the most comprehensive Fuller archive within a thousand mile radius, so I'll likely be consulting him too, just to remind myself about some of the subplots.

Speaking of Applewhite, I think he would have been gratified to see this depiction of Fuller's E-module, with follow-up mention of [David Koski's Youtubes](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2014/06/vzome-work.html) on Facebook:
