Hawthorne Boulevard is actually our northern border, with Sunnyside neighborhood across the way.  Powell, otherwise known as Highway 26, limits us to the south.In cyberspace, I'm waiting for a level three engineer to do something in Apache that'll make [Python source files](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/) pop up on screen, like before.  [The takeover](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5832904&tstart=0) of digitalspace.net by jumpline.com hasn't been entirely without glitches.I'm in a coffee shop with Derek, thinking about what to have next.  A rooiboos latte, honey infused, might be good.I'm expecting to have dinner with Dave, missing Wanderers this time.  Martin Zwick is presenting on his paper [Systems Metaphysics: A Bridge from Science to Religion](http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10051/Default.aspx).  I made some comments in the egroup about it, which I'll now dump to a [world readable text](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/urner_on_zwick.txt) for public linking purposes.We were hoping Larry might join us at dinner this evening, but he's tackling his basement, trying to diagnose a problem.  Derek may be otherwise occupied as well.Tara phoned from a mountain wilderness area covered by Verizon, saying she's having a great time hiking with Larry's Chris, Jane, June and Luci.The call came while I was in said basement, enjoying slides of Amanda's wedding (Chris & Larry's youngest -- their eldest, [Greg](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/08/bridge-pedal-2005.html), is by now back in Moscow).MetroFi continues to expand its coverage of Portland neighborhoods, per this [browser mashup](http://www.metrofi.com/content/maps/mf_portland_map_ad.html). [update:  that link goes nowhere now, as MetroFi later quit the scene, might never have had [a clear storyboard](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/12/sketching-comics.html) in the first place, hard to know].[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhIrAMjZLixzlu8Y6id1HdpdISnQ6pUIhrvvHbJzo8gnsVsR94vawkvBKXjgCP_UJ_YVEBoLEuYsYkFPlmAQ1e56IzEAgSMaegwcj-agJYbwBHr6EmwTJgz1YRNuA63giWaL0lH/s1600-h/metroficoverage.png)Metrofi access pointsin and around Richmond NeighborhoodJuly 31, 2007
