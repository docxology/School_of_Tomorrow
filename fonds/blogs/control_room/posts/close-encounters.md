Thanks to Dr. Fuller's actively cultivating his network while alive, something my dad did really well as well, a lot of us never knew each other, even though we closely identified with his agenda, at one time or another.  I'm not surprised that I keep encountering new people who count big time as friends of Fuller.

Patricia Ravasio is such a person.  Per her recent autobiographical [The Girl from Spaceship Earth](https://www.amazon.com/Girl-Spaceship-Earth-True-Story-ebook/dp/B0791CDMHB/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), we know quite a few people in common.  I only met once with Lloyd Sieden, at a Bellvue coffee shop, whereas D.W. Jacobs and I have crossed paths more than that.

Ditto Foster Gamble, who sings Dr. Robert Gray's praises in one of the Youtubes.  Bob and I were both at the [SNEC](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/12/jitterbug-party.html) founding, at Russell Chu's rented place in DC, some October as I recall, but what year?  To date, that's the only time I met Bob in person, that I can recall.

Yasushi Kajikawa came all the way from Japan for that [SNEC](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/01/fuller-school-stuff.html) summit.  [Applewhite](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html) joined us, and Dr. Joe Clinton.

Even though Foster and I both went to Princeton, our scenarios did not intersect.    I learned about [his work](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=foster+gamble) from [Alex](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/12/mystic-ball-movie-review.html), in my Philosophers' Circle.

So instead of "small world" (a cliche of sorts), let's say "big world" for a change.

I stopped off somewhere in the Southwest to visit Dr. Amy Edmondson that one time.  Matthew and I were driving my sister's car from Montclair NJ to Greater LA, visiting Applewhite in route (that's when he gave me a Synergetics Dictionary).  Harvard Business School was still in Amy's future back then.

I also met up with Dr. Arthur Loeb, her mentor, on a hitchhiking trip up to Cambridge, when still at Princeton.  He was friendly.  We had a good talk.

In terms of where I come down regarding energy, I consider World Game a context for facing our energy needs as a species and making some hard choices.  The terminology is maybe messed up, but that's Tower of Babel for ya.  The point is to keep talking about it, in some detail.

I'd think those most interested in phasing out fossil fuels, among those accepting [climate change](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/biosphere-is-better.html) (I accept it), would embrace the language of Peak Oil.  Whether we shift our weight or not, it looks like we're over the hill in that chapter.

We don't have the option to endlessly guzzle, even if the climate didn't matter (which of course it does).  [Is commuting smart](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/11/end-of-suburbia-movie-review.html)?  People living campus-based lifestyles don't need to drive as much.

Synergetics Dictionary has no entries under [UFO](https://youtu.be/4hX-HE3HaZs).  I don't think Fuller was banking on any new sources of energy we didn't currently know about in the 1970s and 1980s, not even cold fusion.

He did place a lot of faith in humans staying inventive, however his thesis regarding humanity's possibly attaining a new homeostasis, one we might consider successful, did not critically depend on such deus ex machina Jodie Foster like plot twists (thinking of Contact, a fun movie).

Patricia doesn't talk about UFOs in her book, I wasn't meaning to imply that.  She thinks about C60, and why not.

Foster is wide open to the possibility of a truly alien intelligence and the science that might represent, and I'm not against such speculation.  Fuller speculated too, as was his prerogative, as did Stephan Hawking. We're free to make mistakes.  As a species, omniscience is not our forte.

Patricia's autobiography reminds me of [Valerie Plame's](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/07/countdown-to-zero-movie-review.html) in that both writers feel they're undergoing extreme vetting, and choose to be unflinchingly honest about a lot of personal details, giving us insights into their characters to help us assess their respective stories.  [Lindsay Moran](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/methodist-morning.html) also takes that path in her retrospective.

By this time, Dr. Fuller is so invisible that bringing his stuff to light really does have the flavor of a spy novel, with a hint of the paranormal now and then.  That's in keeping with Fuller's spirit as Telepathy is in Synergetics Dictionary quite a bit, along with "only the impossible happens" (cue "synchronicity").

Patricia is vetted by a psychotherapist and the whole book seems like a lie detector test.  Did Bucky really say those things?  Weren't her notes lost in a basement flood?  She's not nearly as self erasing as say Carlos Castaneda, who left everyone guessing until his wives wrote their books.

Her psychotherapist doesn't see anything crazy about her wanting Stanford to make better use of what's in its archives (that's where Fuller's papers ended up, much as the Linus and Ava Helen Pauling papers ended up at OSU).   None of Stanford's course offerings took advantage of this fact.  Even Princeton did better.

I'm looking forward to continuing to meet new people with karmic connections to the Bucky stuff, as well as meeting again with the many I've met (Allegra and I had breakfast that time in Portland, when [the D.W. Jacobs play](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/ieee-presentation.html) was in town).

My continuing to camp out in this area has been a gift that keeps on giving.

Also, I'm [pretty autobiographical](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/another-autobiography-35c3d949df1) as well.  None of us are pretending to be objective disembodied narrators like in those old know-it-all documentaries that simply told us what's what.
