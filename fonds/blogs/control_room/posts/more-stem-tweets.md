If you know nothing about UVT, don't even think about being US president, you'll be too ignorant of US history to merit the job. [#4D](https://twitter.com/hashtag/4D?src=hash)

UVT = unit volume tetrahedron, a core innovation of Medal of Freedom winner R. Buckminster Fuller, the dome guy. [@BuckyFullerInst](https://twitter.com/BuckyFullerInst) [#4D](https://twitter.com/hashtag/4D?src=hash)

UVT means you get a conceptual kit of spatial shapes with nice whole number volumes. Kepler's fave, rhombic dodeca, has volume 6. Wow, easy.

Hey kids, not your fault if Pearson censors UVT (unit volume tetrahedron) from your high school math textbooks. [https://t.co/5UxDn3WjxR](https://t.co/5UxDn3WjxR)

Is it that the UK wants the US to ignore a homegrown genius?  That might be it.  Check your math textbooks.  UVT?  Even just in a sidebar?
