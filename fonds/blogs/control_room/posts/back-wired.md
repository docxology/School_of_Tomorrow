So I'm back to my usual haunts in Portland, having returned from haunts near Remote, Oregon.I liked what Bob Scheiffer said last Thursday (?), about working to earn our trust, not taking it for granted. This Mens Retreat was like that for me -- I had to work building relationships ([work](http://groups.google.com/group/soc.religion.quaker/msg/5de3d876d06d6222?dmode=source&hl=en) I enjoy doing). We had a lot of new faces, plus many more familiar ones (e.g. mine in the mirror), and a lot to communicate, from each to many.I did a good job anchoring my network I thought, but it's a somewhat nebulous network and I felt it taking me out of the room on occasion. I have so many to check in with. And I know I'm not the only one with big responsibilities (duh).Fortunately, good Friends like Tom Head are out there doing a lot of checking. He got to the Dan Rather gig in Portland, reported back, and to China for a high level meeting on military matters, goes to London, Philadelphia...He's an economist, Tom is, based at the nearby George Fox University. Tom couldn't make it to the retreat this year, as I couldn't last year, because he was off traveling some place per usual.Anyway, I'm glad Larry was around.  We talked iTunes and iPods (he had a new nano) -- plus I showed him an excerpt from [Yes Men](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/yes-men-movie-review.html) (the "leisure suit" segment), a DVD I purchased and sometimes screen on my laptop or otherwise project e.g. when I'm wanting to share about my [GST brand](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html) of economics.This money talk reminds me: I need to be on my way, delivering some pay checks to a client for TBC. Derek is supposed to meet me here; the barista was busy when I arrived, so I don't even have a coffee. Maybe when I get back, it'll be time for a Guinness.Over an hour later:OK, so I met up with [Ron Braithwaite](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/07/wanderers-meeting-200575.html), tooling around town in his new biodiesel VW. He wondered about lunch and here we were, in front of Than Thao near the Pauling House, so we ordered V8 and V9 respectively.Derek looked after my Toshiba back at Wired (his is a Compaq), drinking coffee, waiting for Joan.[Ron](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/summer-memories-picture-series.html) is steeped in Apple tech these days.  If he succeeds in today's mission, [Tillamook Creamery](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/tillamook.html) should be a beneficiary (Helvetica fonts lady).  I was glad to meet up with Ron, who also missed our [Men's Retreat](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/mens-retreat.html) this year.I just got a call from Bernita about a death in the family (from natural causes).  My heart goes out to the grieving.
