[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/koski.jpg):: David Koski ::I retreived David from his uncle's in Dunthorpe this morning.  If neighbors Koski and Torvalds ever meet at parties, it's about Finland that they share, not boring operating systems.Later we paid a visit to Meliptus, though the tide was too low to permit its emergence from the boathouse.I took along my newly acquired Bobliographon, the SubGenius Psychlopaedia of Slack.David invested a lot of his youthful days in sunny California exploring [Synergetics-related geometry](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/playing-with-blocks.html), especially [phi-scaled tetrahedral blocks](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica5.html).  Today, he's a union HVAC engineer in Minneapolis, [still interested](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/hexa-wuh.html) in geometry.While I was returning David to his uncle's, and again stopping by Trader Joe's, Dawn and Tara went to Freddie's for the Sim Pets add-on to Sims 2.  Tara is quite blissful, now that her cute electronic dolls have these cute pets to go with.Last night I took her to see the kick-off ISEPP lecture, by [Dr. William Saturno](http://www.isepp.org/Pages/06-07%20Pages/Saturno.html) on Mayan archeology.  Saturno is an excellent storyteller.Mayan cities really chewed through those trees, sometimes resulting in their outright abandonment (and later reoccupation).  The forests atop these ruins (many from hundreds of years before Jesus) remain discolored even to this day, thanks to all that limestone plaster, and hence their tell-tale visibility to satellites, helping archeologist geocachers get there first, to protect the public record from more selfish and greedy looters and their black market accomplices.We've got trips locked in to both New Mexico and Orlando, though I'm on a tight leash these days, owing to my ongoing fun gig with Saturday Academy.Related reading:[The Archeology of Mathematics Teaching](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1476318&tstart=0) @ Math Forum
