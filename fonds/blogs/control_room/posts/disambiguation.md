Of course in many schools, they just sat on a shelf.Given an accumulation of post-war detritus, children and grandchildren of baby boomers may be unfamiliar with these colorful manipulables, which go against the grain of modern fashion.More likely they remember a brand of food processor known as the Cuisinart.However, here again, the [Cuisinart brand](http://www.cuisinart.com/) needs disambiguation from any specific kitchen appliance sold under that trademark, such as the coffeemaker depicted below.I purchased one of these gizmos at my local Peet's today, replacing a broken Starbucks Barista.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuTlVcLTtImqVlovvAlq5trszXKWlDoWzAGQtSLwnQ4GKEHENYKRWC8bD1w30s0HKLlR6p7VOTcMmsYpZrxVzmLGtPA9QWg7FRmgr8L-l5chBoJUcr7rhdiGUttJVkUxfWdHyQ/s1600-h/cuisinart.jpg)
