Talk about collusion on genocide!  Obviously the denazification program was never completed in the American mindset. Ukrainians and Bosnians, even Syrians, got to leave the war zone. Palestinians though: they're supposed to love bygone olive groves so much that they'll put up with any amount of carnage. Stay in the cage with the rabid dog kids! They're nostalgic at gunpoint.If I were a Palestinian, I'd use my sovereignty to get the hell out of there and never return. I'd have the right of return, but I wouldn't use it. Who wants to go back to a hellhole Americans worship as "a holy land"? Not me. I'll take New Jersey over Gaza any day of the week. But wait, I have no sovereignty, that's the whole problem. I'm supposed to just stay here and get bombed while the Americans fret and act stupid (what they're best at).XREF:[Gazans to Guantanamo?](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2023/10/gazans-to-guantanamo.html)[City of Morons](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/08/city-of-morons.html)[Why We Fight (movie review)](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html)
