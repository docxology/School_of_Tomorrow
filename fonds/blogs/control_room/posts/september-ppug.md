We had a far out convergence of Pythoneers this evening @ [CubeSpace](http://www.wweek.com/wwire/?p=8425), Portland.  Our four lightning talks, two of them mine, were most illuminating: tux droid; my EuroPython experience; PyFlakes; PIL.Ruby folks are holding a dojo in the same space, with their own screen and projector facing the other way.  About 16 of us, 4 of them, lots of friendly banter.Jeff is moderating, inventing process as he goes (resourceful guy).The Intel guy's PIL work is about a robot detecting orange traffic cones.  He projected some source code for smoothing and separating the R, G & B channels, with some simple arithmetic to detect orange.Earlier today:  just a light gym workout, mostly on the elliptical.  I had 10 flatscreens within view, 9 illuminated, running 7 distinct programs.
