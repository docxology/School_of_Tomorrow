Expect to seesome today (they're in prime condition -- thanks OTY). I have this dynamite recipe I'm hoping to use for FnB one day, butdon't mind sharing ahead of time: [http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/together-friends.html](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/together-friends.html)  The molasses would be too sweet for some of our associates, and theonion verboten. However it does have sour ingredients.  Thumbs up.  Not my invention(not taking credit). I might just make it a side dish instead of an entre. We were semi-silently marking one year of service where MultnomahFriends are concerned. [http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/09/quaker-doings.html](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/09/quaker-doings.html)  I saw David's new flyer, verbose / micro-print, took it off to myperch (where I sometimes go when on duty). Again, we all have active imaginations so if you have a different ideaof PR, shake your booty. I've got my daughter Tara, recently returned from Managua, advising meon aesthetic possibilities (and/or traps to avoid). Kirby- Hide quoted text -  On Thu, Sep 1, 2011 at 3:16 PM, kirby urner wrote:> Opening 3:30 today.
