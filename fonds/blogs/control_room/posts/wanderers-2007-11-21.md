The agenda for this meeting remained volatile right up through the opening, oscillating somewhere between "open" and "programmed."The [Tiller video](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_A._Tiller) (Stanford emeritus, one of the [Bleep](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/what-bleep-movie-review.html) guys) was somewhat Wanderers like, but the audience was more polite and deferential than is our wont, so after about 45 minutes we paused the DVD and went ape for a few.Then I had to bow out (taking my Dell laptop which had been playing the DVD -- fortunately we still had Bill's), owing to this being that Thanksgiving Season again, and I have a great deal to be thankful for, even amidst sorrow, plus a lot of logistics to handle.Yesterday I thought Glenn was appropriately skeptical of this cymatic "[face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jke7_1GdF1Q)" as they call it, which might actually be one of those grays, and cousin to the one on Mars.This political ad by Mike Huckabee and his friend Chuck Norris is [hilarious](http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=EjYv2YW6azE).Thank you Trevor, for turning me on to the [Ulam Spiral](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=%22ulam+spiral%22).As I was saying, I have much gratitude to express, many lucky stars to thank.
