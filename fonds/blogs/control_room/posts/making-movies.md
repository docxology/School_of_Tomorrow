I just watched the commentary on the restored version of Metropolis that Glenn retrieved from our library. The story line followed is closer to the original, not the distorted and overly shortened version that got through the censors of that day.  

That's what adults have to look forward to regarding our time as well:  a less juvenile take on world events that we get from our contemporaries, who have little choice but to react from the hip, especially if not well versed in history and generic patterns ala GST and all the rest of it. 

One of the movies we're making is about Pearl Harbor, and the water table, the drinking water.  A Flint-like situation is starting to unfold.  That's a movie in the making.

We have uplifting films too, about true heroes and great ideas.  Lots of people are ready and willing to star in these productions.  Old Man River City comes to mind.

The idea that a UBI is "for nothing" is maybe too squanderous a vocab.  You're being paid to get yourself educated and on to the world stage as a persona.  That takes doing homework.  You'll be grateful for a safety net.  Perhaps your elders didn't have time to plan.  Some of them did.

We talk a lot about Bucky on my Youtube channel.
