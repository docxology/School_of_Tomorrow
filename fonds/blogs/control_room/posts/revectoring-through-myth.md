The deep learning model inspires many metaphors, including that of the ancestral tree, wherein you don't get to back propagate exactly, but you do carry a memory of previous weights and so still might enjoy gradient descent over time. It's just a matter of compressing the older layers into memories as the "wave of time" rolls forwards. No math need change really, it's just a gestalt. The Fall of Man is our Gradient Descent towards Omega (falling towards God, not away from, but lagging behind).

Those following my twists and turns (why would they?) would find a long term fascination with "cult" as a term and my seeking to give it neutral grounding in "subculture". Then comes Cultagory Theory (a play on Category Theory) and Cultography, a stand-in for Anthropology but also a play on Cosmography (one of Fuller's, posthumous thanks to Kiyoshi Kuromiya).

My anchoring in this lineage jibes with the Subgenius / Discordian lineage and that Encyclopedia of Conspiracies, my website cited. That won me cred, and I'm not trying to shy away from where Fuller was going with his Grunch conspiracy (not his alone by definition, hello Marshall McLuhan).

What's some of the "revectoring" that I'm doing, outside the cube vs tetrahedron stuff that you've maybe seen a lot of by now?

My insight is when Greek mythology was still a working living system, the screenwriters would steer the melodrama to both guide and mirror the pluribus unum in that unum nation we call Greece (a meme city, or complex, more spread out than hard borders would show). They'd invent some new story, those high priests would, as they divined what the people needed. Next stop: the amphitheaters, the Broadway of that day (or Times Square).

I'm resurrecting those mythological motifs in my story about Athena, daughter of Zeus, establishing her oracular base in Delphi, omphalos of Middle Earth. The Pronea, and female aspect of the Pythia, persisted into the Age of Apollo, supposedly beginning with his slaying of the Python, in this new version Athena's pet.

The Python got away, but the Apollonians didn't need to know that, as the dragon snake no longer frequented Parnassus, the new establishment could say, which was true enough. But in a somewhat Mormon move, I move the scene to the western hemisphere, to Nashville, Tennessee, where a new Temple to Athena is built under World's Fair auspices. Athena and her Python, as well as Nike, are re-established and spread their music.

This motif has woven through these blogs back through OSCONs, when Gibson Guitar sent a bizmo to Portland, Silicon Forest, newest Capital of Open Source. The geek with the laptop was akin to the solo musician with a guitar. To program is to compose. We were the new Cult of Athena, with our PyLadies.

Back in Delphi, Apollo is always contrasted with Dionysus. Opposed to the pure light of rationality are the dark impulses of the introverted emo, frustrated by Apollonian fascism and periodically overturning the rules based order, in need of an overdue paradigm shift.  But that's not the dynamic here in the western hemisphere ("the west" once revectored), as the Athenian vibe ain't the Apollonian one -- he's her half brother BTW. Different polarity.

Perhaps the most stable arrangement for now is a triangle, although not a romantic one, more a power dynamic. Apollo and Dionysus aren't getting to trade places to rectify matters as Athena is keeping her cool, using the tension towards more creative ends, a different chaos (unpredictable content).  Like I said, this is how we programmed (steered within) the Zeitgeist back in the day, before Mad Magazine and Madison Avenue. Before Freud and Bernays. 

The slides in the above YouTube do not include subsequent slides giving more details regarding my Just Use It campaign. Mostly I'm back to "Zionetics" and "Church of Bucky" type stuff (as Snelson called it).
