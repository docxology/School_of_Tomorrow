[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3216530230/)Twas my privilege to meet with the CSN CTO [at Laughing Planet](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/laughing-planet.html) today, to go over my Pycon 2009 Chicago slides.  I'm now one of the lucky few with this Save the Polar Bears T-shirt, [a fine work of art](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/12/bear-booty.html).We also chatted about the CFO some, another jet setter, if I may use an archaic term.Prior to jets, Hollywood movie stars would head for [Avalon, Catalina](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/back-from-catalina.html), a romantic overnight trip.  The small airfield wasn't really about handling large scale commercial traffic, so when jet travel came into vogue, Catalina sort of went off the radar, in favor of Paris, Hawaii...The Chicago talk looks at [the importance of mnemonics](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/interface-designs.html), the [Art of Memory](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Memory-Frances-Yates/dp/0226950018/), as a complement of skills building.  We master new skills with a purpose, because we're expecting to accomplish some real world task.  A seminar or workshop will have that purpose as a focus, and [gear its stories](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3214428790/) accordingly.The same skills-building exercises will come wrapped in different stories, depending on which subculture is making use of the tools (in this case, [computer languages](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/brought-to-you-by.html)).My choice of [predominantly Akbar font](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/idle-language-games.html) was pretty interesting.  We talked about Oregon's history as a source of cartooning, including of [political cartooning](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/wanderers-20061212.html).   My particular [brand of positive futurism](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/twenty-wall-posters-digital-art.html) builds on that past.
