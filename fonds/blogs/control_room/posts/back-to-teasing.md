We've got this character named Israeli Knight, seriously.Â  I call him IK for short (see below).

You can [dig through math-teach](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9643244) yourself if interested, an [acquired taste](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/11/common-core-mathematics-as-poverty-line.html) for sure.

Anyway, he's a racist of the classic sort, and Biblical to boot, so I asked him this question, as a way of spiraling back to a favorite video:

Say IK I've been wanting your take on this short operetta about a black King and a white woman who decide to collaborate on an oasis development project, thereby attracting attention from the natives. Do you think it's a good idea to form inter racial business partnerships of this kind?
