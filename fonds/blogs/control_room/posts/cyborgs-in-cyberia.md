The realm of true facts (truths), whatever they are, under determines our moral and ethical response thereto, meaning objective facts are insufficient to provide an existential framework. We have to supply the interpretation, which is where free will enters the picture i.e. subjectivity, such as there is any. Objectively speaking, most thoughts and emotions arise just as mechanically as any other programmed phenomenon. Humans should not be afraid of being cyborgs. For the most part, that's what we are. And we're reprogrammable, our saving grace though perhaps insufficient, especially if we have no faith in it i.e. if we deny intuition.
