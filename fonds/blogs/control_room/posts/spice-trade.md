By "spice trade" I refer to something positive, namely our bid to up the IQ around our spanking new C.P. Snow chasm-spanning curriculum.  Getting the right wiring takes time, as we test the [various subsystems](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/physics-update.html).To "spice it up" means to "kick it up" i.e. "to take it up a notch".  These are idioms associated with adding more hot sauce to make a dish less bland.  Another idea is you don't need a lot.
