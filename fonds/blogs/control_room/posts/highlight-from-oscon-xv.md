Quoting my own review [on Google+](https://plus.google.com/103612403293043723797/posts/6i9UMucK3S7):

One of the more interesting keynotes [at OSCON](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/07/oscon-xv.html), starting with the cut of 
his suit, and right through Obama appearing on video asking "what the 
heck is an API".  Just right for OSCON, made our geeks happy and proud. 
 Good job White House.
