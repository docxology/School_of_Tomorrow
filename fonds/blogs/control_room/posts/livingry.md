Drawing from the strength of Dawn's memorial service just completed, which drew us together from so many walks of life, I wish to transform our energy, our fire, into a sense of gratitude.I am especially grateful to those who've come before us, blazing a way, including developing for themselves and for us these miraculous technologies of cars on freeways, jets in skyways, a growing toolbox of esoterica, some effective, against disease. Because of these things, we were enabled to experience a great healing in the wake of Dawn's life, an act of lovingkindness and a contribution to us all.Humanity, bending technology to humane uses, has the potential to do well for itself, to alleviate suffering, to work, to enjoy.I ask that I remain open to Mother Nature as a teacher for me, and as one who assigns me tasks. To serve God is not to turn one's back on the gift of creation, but to manifest a divine will in whose image we have our being.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwJxPPdNaSujsRmlfCojtFhedVhGaOzDOQ5nzRALSGJ7P1LUWN3K31vK0xRnjorKqqR3eVFzrq7jUvevfm0ImW_dEbAlJB04hTLak1SOqL-PepGTS11p80nDrs0hXc5uF6IfsC/s1600-h/soundsetup.jpg)
