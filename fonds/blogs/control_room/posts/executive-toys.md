Spin them in thin air, and they flip to the other color, a kind of jitterbug action (more [esoterica](http://www.goodmagazine.com/section/Guide/good_guide_r_buckminster_fuller)).That sculpture in the background is no way a toy.  That's Barrel Tower, a [Kenneth Snelson](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/hunter-art-museum-chattanooga.html) original and gift from the artist.I'm bullish about my cube.
