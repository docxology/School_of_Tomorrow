Yeah,
 it's hard to not get cynical about religion once one sees how it's 
harnessed by the temporal powers to their own ends.  [Emperor Constantine](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/12/twelve-years-of-slavery-movie-review.html)
 learned his lesson:  if you can't beat 'em, join 'em, i.e make the 
Roman Empire officially Christian and you'll have the tools to keep 
growing.  

Mass produce Christian baubles for the gift shops, and
 the faithful will follow you blindly, as their "blind faith" (so very 
similar to blind loyalty to one's King) is built right in as a virtue, 
at least in the more decadent brands of pyramid scheme hierarchy.  

Obedience, not defiance, is what to cultivate in the masses.  Any religion able to do that is worth more than gold.  

Religion
 is used to create that state of reverence and solemnity, gravitas.  The
 Cross gets planted on some South American beachhead, and voila, miracle
 of miracles, this is now Papal Property.  Amazing.  It's downright 
Biblical!

Unfortunately for emperors and dictators, crime bosses 
of all kinds, Christianity is not quite tame enough to support a Borg 
Cube forever.  Whereas most humans seem eager to the point of desperate 
to surrender their free will to experts, professionals, pundits of all 
stripes, a tiny minority seems hell bent on doing its own thinking.  
Irreverent Quakers pop up, questioning authority, refusing oaths of 
loyalty.  WTF!?  Where does the operator's manual say how to deal with 
Quakers?

As a result of such obstreperousness, micro-fractures 
emerge, and every so often, we get a meltdown, like the 100 years war 
twixt Catholics and Protestants [exemplary of a "meltdown" not saying Quaker caused -- KTU ].  Or the Civil War in the US.  Or maybe 
even something good happens.  A shakeup in world religions might be just
 what the doctor ordered.

For whatever reason our species refuses
 to settle into any one Kingdom or Reich.  I consider this hopeful and 
positive.  The Tower of Babel is maybe my favorite Bible story.  Silly 
humans, thinking they could create One System to Rule Them All.  Ain't 
gonna happen.

Thanks to some divine spark within common humanity,
 the peasants, handed a gun and a picture of their God, sometimes 
disobey their "superiors" and refuse to kill the enemy, seeing through 
the manipulation.  They see The Man behind the curtain, and, like 
Smedley "Fighting Quaker" Butler say out loud that [War is a Racket](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/esozone-talk.html).

However,
 to see religion as a tool of social control is not to see the falsity 
of all religion.  Cynicism of that variety is simply too easy.

Rather,
 the many religions and psychologies, not to mention philosophies, do 
indeed give us insights into something both collective and transcendent 
about the individual human mind.  

One could simply say "religion is the power of God's mind combined with
 the human being's endless ability to distort it".  The idea that 
humanity is simply a distorted image of what true angels must be like is an
 old one and I think I'll land it there for now -- a friendly / familiar
 airport.
