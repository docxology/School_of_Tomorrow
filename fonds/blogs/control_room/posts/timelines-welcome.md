[At Thirsters](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/01/thirsters-gather.html), a room on East Broadway where cognoscenti gather, we're blessed with some interesting room decor, including a framed timeline of world history, based on a Biblical version of events.  I'm guessing it was published in the early 1900s, maybe late 1800s?

I've been talking [to Glenn](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/07/about-factory.html) about his [Global Matrix](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/12/global-data-global-matrix.html) system and the timelines it purveys, unfortunately not in such a concrete form as a website, yet.  [Maybe 11K BC](https://en.wiki2.org/wiki/Last_glacial_period) is when we find some evidence of humanity emerging from the prior ice age.

The Missoula floods (about thirty of them) have to do with great glaciers melting.  Lakes would pool in the ice way back when, then one warm day, break through some rim and drench the land to the sea.

The Black Sea got filled in [around the same time](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/blacksea/ax/frame.html) right?  Noah wasn't lying about what was to come.

That wasn't the only flood though.  Plus there've been other ice ages.

The coasts keep changing.  Looking at the globe today does not tell us the scene even a few thousand years ago.  Dilmun is mostly under water.

Deep time timelines must be out there, I'm just in the mood to find them.  That's my attitude.  They must be out there.

Yes, it's true, scholars do not all agree about deep history or what happened when.  Timelines are based on specific schools of thought.  Lets just get them on the table at least.

The precession of the planet on its axis is important to relate to climate phenomena.  Our north axis points at Polaris these days, but that was not always the case.

Before we got into this age of Ursa, the north axis was pointed more at a star in Draco.  Old myths talk about the bear triumphing over the dragon.

It takes about 26K years to do a precessional cycle.  "In approximately 3200 years, the star Gamma Cephei in the Cepheus constellation will succeed Polaris for this position." [[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession)]
