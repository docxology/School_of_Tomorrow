I wrote [this memo](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1380445) to math teaching community this morning.Based on prior experience, I expect little reaction from the USA-based teachers who currently frequent [this list](http://mathforum.org/kb/forum.jspa?forumID=206).  Developing a more sophisticated approach to math teaching, using recent computer technology, is pretty much the furthest thing from their minds.After all, math through programming is not what the [textbooks](http://www.edutopia.org/magazine/ed1article.php?id=Art_1195&issue=nov_04) are about, and textbooks define reality to most teachers.  Anything outside of a textbook is seen as just pie in the sky dreamweaving, no matter how much [free and open source material](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/02/valentines-day-2006.html) is made available via the Internet.Anyway, I'm not reporting any news here, just more of the same old same old.  We've had to learn ways of working around the established math teacher [networks and organizations](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/restoring-integrity.html).  They're entrenched in their ways and not really relevant to our work.
