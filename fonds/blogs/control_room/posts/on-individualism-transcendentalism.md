Thompson, embraced a "[new journalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Journalism)" on the understanding that these wildly differing perspectives might co-exist as our collective heritage within our shared democratic context (worth defending!).Making "identity crafting" a chief responsibility (like a full time job) is akin to the "soul-making" project of [James Hillman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillman), a Jungian talking about individuation, or "self actualization" (Maslow).  The alchemical experience of Synergy is one of a guiding and/or intuitive hand (God's grace and/or will), such that one's own person becomes a vehicle for surfing atop a broader, more oceanic intelligence, an experience of Inner Light as Quakers are wont to call it.Minus transcendence, "identity crafting" degenerates into shallow self- absorption, other lower forms of consciousness (or unconsciousness).  The Catholics are right to warn us about the high cost of vanity, the prideful taking of personal credit for that which emerged from deeper sources.  The ego is not forged by the ego alone, another way of casting the "[no self nature](http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/singer.htm)" teaching, a dharma  perpetually frustrating to Milton's Satan in Paradise Lost.  To invert Paul Tillich's [pithy meme](http://www.escapefromwatchtower.com/tilground.html), it takes courage to not be as well (i.e. to accept the only quasi- or even pseudo- reality of the persona, [the mask](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/search?q=mask)).Individuation actually involves increasing one's awareness of otherness,  multiplying the variety of viewpoints from which one's self and one's world might be viewed.  Fuller quotes Robert Burns on this subject, at the start of his [Critical Path](http://www.seedsofunfolding.org/issues/xvii/resources_1.htm): "Oh                          wad some power the giftie gie us to see oursels as others                          see us."
