I met with [another Python teacher](http://blog.deliciousrobots.com/) today after the user group meeting.  He's doing a class for the Art Insitute, whereas I'm teaching for Saturday Academy.  We're both using IDLE on Windows, which DARPA-funded, initially Guido-programmed shell is under fire for being far behind the state of the art these days, and therefore perhaps more of a liability than an asset.  [IDLE barely works](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/04/immersive-python.html) on some versions of Apple software.But what would we use in its place that might likewise be included within the standard Python distro?Another Python guy wanted to talk hyper-geometry, had been watching [the math-dimensions videos](http://dimensions-math.org/) and was planning a talk in August.I told him about our recent contest for "most primitive space-filler", with D.M.Y. Sommerville nailing four candidates back in 1923.  Fuller had circled one of these four as the Mite, and I've been championing this decision, though the four quads of [the Rite](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/matrix-of-sytes.html) also meet Sommerville's criteria.  The other two are Mite-fillable.  The heart of the Rite may be graphed using Mites, but they won't fill the four quads.Judging from traffic on the Polylist, there's still a contingent favoring the "characteristic tetrahedron" instead (Mite-fillable).  This shape is not one of Sommerville's candidates for the obvious reason that it comes in left and right flavors -- [not properly congruent](http://www.mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2093280&tstart=0).  Hand-waving about symmetry ensues.On the other hand, Fuller is adamant that the Mite is also "flavored" even though it's outwardly always the same shape.  I compiled [a list of pointers](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/61890) into Synergetics Dictionary on this topic, admittedly somewhat esoteric.  [Aristotle was right](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2084375&tstart=0), remember the Mite.What about those troops and ships moving into Central America?  Rumors are flying.[Speaking of esoteric](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/geek-esoterica.html), the presentations during the Python meeting were somewhat on the abstruse side, especially the one by Dan Colish on constructing a context free grammar parser.  This was pure computer science.I've not been invited to OSCON this year (proposal not accepted), so I won't be weighing down these blogs with [my usual techno-babble](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/01/reviewing-my-oscon-2005-talk.html).  Plenty of others to fill in those gaps.  OSCON is somewhat expensive and I don't have sponsors who think I need to be there.  However, a number of free events around the edges will give me some opportunities to compare notes with peers.
