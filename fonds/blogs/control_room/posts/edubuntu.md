[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/caroloffice.0.jpg)(click photo for larger view)Derek lent me an old Compaq Deskpro he bought recently, one of five workstations. He put Suse 10 on one of them, [Edubuntu](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/launch-pad.html) on another, the one I'm borrowing. I've got it set up in Carol's office, which feels appropriate, given all the memorabilia she has from that part of the world, and from Lesotho especially.Maybe I'll be able to get [Panda3D](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/05/panda3d.html) running on this thing.  I saw two Ubuntu download options at the [web site](http://panda3d.org/download.php).  Which one should I choose?
