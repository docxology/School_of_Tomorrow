My blurb on Facebook:

An hour and ten minutes of really excellent, high definition footage. Homeless camping out in downtown Portland. Articulate, interesting, colorful interviews. 

Congratulations to Jordan (neighbor) and Lindsey (housemate) for distilling this excellent update and sequel to [Occupy Portland](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/04/occupation-nation-movie-review.html). Episode 1. A salute to Adam and Melody as well.
