I was chauffeuring some teens recently, listening to them speculate in the back seat, as to why so many preachers come on TV very late at night, pandering to insomniacs.Teen:  "I think insomniacs tend to be more sinnerly and so watch these shows to maybe get cured of their sinnerism, and churches know this."I had nothing to add to this analysis, just kept my eyes on the road, enjoying their pithy succinctness.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgleIpbfVcN0pDOT5HNfJtQLh3yRIi_Mf3ooOdbGdUndVlU4unZUKCxvs9STWFBRohj45dIdXZGfWa7Glyid752_fHYBaHWozpEOpCSPZpD8lYSPkv3aENRRcPX_sSKhV3YDf-D/s1600-h/ieee_membership.png)exhibit: reupping with IEEE (click for larger view)
