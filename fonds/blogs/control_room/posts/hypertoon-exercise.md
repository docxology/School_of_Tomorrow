Imagine a lot of plastic transparent tubing snaking in an out of an abandoned factory building, not along the ground but in the air.  This snaking hose pattern represents the potential flight path of one or more drones.

Along any given segment, several tubes may run in parallel, but then peel away in various directions.  

We looked at models like this at the Field Structure Institute quite a bit, thanks to Don Bridell and Gary Doskas specifically.

From the point of view of a drone pilot, what unfolds on screen is a hypertoon, with segments repeating as the drone dives though a particular window, and coming to segues, where one of several maneuvers is selected.

Once these scenarios are all smoothly interconnected, one has the basis for a computer game of both chance and skill, given the decision points (segue hubs, peel off and rejoin options), and/or something fun to watch that runs on autopilot.
