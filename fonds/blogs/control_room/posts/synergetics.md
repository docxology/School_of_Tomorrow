A reason Fuller's Synergetics doesn't get a lot of press in some circles, is Fuller never bought into there being some "ladder to omniscience" in the following sense:  "solving" quantum physics, i.e. nailing it, still wouldn't let us predict Maxwell's Equations or the price of rice.  

The little stuff doesn't encompass or explain the bigger stuff, because synergy. That's heresy per some dogmas.

I got a message something along those lines from a lecture by Nobel Prize winning Dr. Robert Laughlin, wherein he talked about upsetting the apple cart at different levels. 

Extrapolating: it's not like the gears are locked so tightly that we have to wait for heaven and earth to move before we experience breakthroughs at some intermediate level, i.e. even when levels above and below seem relatively unperturbed. 

On some frequency on the radio dial, a plot twists, not disturbing other programming, yet awakening those who've tuned in. 

Storms may be confined, but not rendered unreal. Expect those teapot tempests. Conservation laws at work.
