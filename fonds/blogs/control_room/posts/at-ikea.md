A lot of ruckus was raised today, [at Occupy Portland](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/occupy-portland-event.html).  Per my earlier chat with [Melody](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6218455175/in/set-72157627710609369), I'd be spending the evening in a slightly ironic setting:  out by PDX (the airport), shopping with my daughter at Ikea.  The experience is apropos however, as I was discussing with Tara over coffee and other sundries:  is it Swedish efficiency and smooth civilian operations that we're fighting, or just corrupt, overly weaponized, [lazy / cowardly capitalism](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html), as practiced by the wimps on Wall Street?  A rhetorical question, obviously, as I'm [defending Ikea](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/screen-tests.html) to some degree, [also Costco](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/01/fnb-2010113.html).What's obscene about the business practices that run rampant in the US, a weakly governed territory held together with a rather [weak glue](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/erratum.html), is the ugly lifestyles it engenders, the ostentatiousness that's synonymous with poor taste and a lack of standards.  [The squandering](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/05/squanderers.html) of fuel oil in pursuit of pseudo-dreams and fantasies, as nurtured by screenwriters for TV, is especially symptomatic.  The people have been reduced to wretchedness, in logistical support of such ugliness, and they're tired of it.If the global idiocracy can think of nothing better to do than engage in war for sport and profit, then sure, the job is to topple such a fragile house of cards. That'd be the [patriotic](http://grunch.net/archives/117), not to mention [intelligent](http://grunch.net/synergetics/gst1.html) thing to do.Not that the [October Occupation](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/v-for-vendetta-movie-review.html) is over [at the time of this writing](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/66380). When I left, FNB was taking up a position to offer sustenance and morale, even as [riot cops](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6218986904/in/set-72157627710609369) were amassing in the side streets. There's always a chance the cops might spaz out and start firing tear gas etc., even though Portlanders are generally pretty good at handling themselves these days and the organizers are fierce about keeping this a sober if festive event with a minimal footprint in terms of damage to infrastructure.  No pooping elephants or horses.  The Rose Festival (which permits sidewalk camping) makes a bigger mess, with its [Fun Center](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/06/fun-center.html).I'll check in with them later, after closing time.[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6220698960/)
