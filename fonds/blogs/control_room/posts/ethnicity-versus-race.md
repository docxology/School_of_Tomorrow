There's this stereotype that some people are bred to be snobs. That's more a joke really. It comes with the territory, that one ethnicity will look down on another, as a way of maintaining its own cohesion. Dr. Seuss made fun of this whole pattern in his children's book about the Sneetches.

Lets go with "snob islands" and talk about breeding. 

When it comes to dogs and other show animals, breeding has come to mean something specific having to do with genetics (breeding in certain traits, while breeding out others), such as creating different colors of Lab for example. My Sy is chocolate colored.

When it comes to humans, we speak of "breeding" as a kind of "grooming" wherein a child is shaped and molded by means of memes more than genes. The training is epigenetic, meaning not that dependent on specific strands of DNA. 

"Through breeding" is how ethnicities develop, groups or subcultures, with in-common biases and attitudes. Some ethnicities seem to brand around their antipathy towards one or more others. Many professions could never afford themselves such a luxury, not having the freedom to be so picky, in terms of clientele.

Now you may suffer from a kind of blindness that makes it hard for you to distinguish between ethnicity and race. I've done a lot of blog posts on this topic, tracing back to my interest in anthropology and even early childhood experiences. I understand, by breeding, that "race" is an embarrassment to those who think in racist terms and that I don't have to willingly join in that type of thinking. 

I'm still free to distinguish between ethnicities and if I think pointing out your skin color will help others find you in a crowd, then I might mention it, along with that you wear glasses and wear a backpack. Where's Waldo?

I'm relieved to see we don't have so many "Caucasians" anymore, thanks to Ancestry dot com and like that. People are getting that more nuanced view of their Eurasian roots, and don't insist they all come from that one trendy neighborhood, which most of them couldn't find on a map without help from Google.

In summary, I think some ethnicities will persist in thinking in terms of race, but mine need not, nor need people who share my breeding.
