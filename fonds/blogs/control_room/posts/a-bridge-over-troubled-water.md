My Youtube channel conceit (that's an OK thing to have in literary criticism) is I'm [designing curriculum](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/4dsolutions/School_of_Tomorrow/blob/master/GroupTheory.ipynb) for an Elite Quaker School (warning: stereotype), like Sidwell or one of those. I've got the New England Transcendentalism going, but also Pound and Poe. So yeah, heavy on the humanities but with a bridge from Xanadu across the C.P. Snow Chasm, to STEM, land of the Stemites (not a typo). That bridge is made of C6XTY it seems, a commercial product or artwork or something mirage-like and shimmery, on the brink of esoteric to the point of occult.
