That's a heavy-hearted title.  Who knew, when they built this city in the forests, made a Stump Town, then Portlandia, that they were building atop jello pudding.  Shake time is roughly 300 years mas o meno.

There's a sense of the past tense in living here, sweet mortality.  As if we're already gone.

What happened in Japan is haunting as we feel next in line.

[At OMSI](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/forces-of-nature-movie-review.html) we watched some places in Turkey in the danger zone, a film.

Is this what they call "escapism"?

Is it only an "ism" because it doesn't really work?

Our zip code might shake a little less, being on the Mt. Tabor shield.  The local martial arts studio has already reinforced.  People take training classes, watch movies of their impending doom.

Life is sweeter in that light, which no doubt accounts for some of the atmosphere.
