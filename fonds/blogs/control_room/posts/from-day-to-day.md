Just off the cell with Dr. Nick, having contacted Verizon to roll back the terms (a rep had talked me into a lower text messages bracket but that had backfired).I cataloged a list of science fiction storyboards I'm working on, some closer to reality than others. This was to Brian with copies to [our Wanderers group](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/02/posting-to-wanderers-list.html), which meets on that Linus Pauling Campus I sometimes write about:[EPCOT West](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/64037); safety corridor for academic degree program "truckology" students twixt Istanbul and Kabul / Stans; [Pycon / Tehran](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/08/pycon-tehran.html); Pycon / Havana (post Gitmo); Martian Math cartoons (Japan / PDX); "weapons inspector" as a major at University of Colorado and New Mexico Tech, Python courses and lightning talks, GOSCON, "[girl scout math](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=206&threadID=2213242)" at abandoned military bases in the Philippines (lots of Martian Math influence); SeaWorld / Iraq (going on many years by now -- [relevant that Keiko](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/recruiting-new-wanderer.html) is an honorary Wanderer); Countdown to Zero, [the computer game / simulation ](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/countdown-to-zero-game.html)(Valerie Plame Wilson and Scott Ritter sought for board of advisors).Science fiction?  Maybe, although some of these are pretty dang real (Martian Math is on Wikieducator and was field tested at Reed College this summer; GOSCON = government + open source, was a blast this year, I was at the table with PSF chairman Steve Holden, Rami Kassab of Portland, and some Barcampers from where Keith and I last met up).Martian Math:[http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157622961425831/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157622961425831/)GOSCON:[http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157625315757940/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157625315757940/)[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157625315757940/)So is that review or preview or what?  We all have our preferred futures, and science fiction is a way to express them.  The [Science Fiction Museum](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/baroque-cycle-manuscript.html) in Seattle, part of the Experience the Music Project (EMP), focuses on this theme quite a bit, or did when I went through.After making supper for Tara and I (toasted cheese sandwiches with pickles), it was time for Food Not Bombs.  I took the bike Lindsey tricked out for me, versus the FNB hauler with the tall pedestal.  What a crowd tonight!  Simon, Aaron, Cera... David.  Lots of people I couldn't name.I told David about the college major  of "weapons inspector" I was writing about, a story set in the near future when we have a lot of weapons to inspect (kind of a joke).  I think he could see why I'd be recruiting for this career among those standing for Food Not Bombs.  I also explained the difference between a maze and a labyrinth.Satya was just arriving as I departed, ships in the night, quick greetings on passing bicycles.
