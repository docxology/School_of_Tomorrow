classes and subclasses([click here](http://www.vimeo.com/user595710/videos) for high resolution version)

[My blurb in the Math Forum](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5499602&tstart=0) pointing to these shorts. Where to go from here?  How about [Working with Stickworks](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/stickworks.html)?  Or maybe read more about [__rib__ syntax](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/lunch-on-hawthorne.html).
