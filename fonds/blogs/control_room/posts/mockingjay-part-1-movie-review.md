My daughter warned me as I entered one of Plato's many caves ([The Bagdad](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/11/hunger-games-two-movie-review.html)) -- having just bought her [his Republic](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/15281482623/), a new translation -- that this would not be a happy world, beer and pizza notwithstanding, nor one tied off with a bow (being a Part One).

Katniss, Tara noted (having seen it earlier), had broken through to a next meta-level of The Hunger Games when manipulating cat behavior in a bomb shelter (cave), suddenly seeing her own role (as Katniss) with new eyes (bingo, enlightenment strikes).

I'm somewhat in awe of this whole series which snuck up on me.  The pieces it fits together are pieces we've seen before, but the arrangement seems deftly done and that impresses me.  More to think about.  The Wag the Dog aspect is especially intriguing i.e. the PR dimension.

I've been writing about PR a lot on the Math Forum, sometimes in complement with [a disillusioned "mad man"](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9652617) from Bangalore, soured on sloganeering from having pushed too many products he did not personally approve of.
