A down side of my no beer diet is some of my outfits gained a gunny sack appearance, unfortunate this time of year, when people are on the alert for people to assist.  Or maybe I'm just too much the scrooge to buy clothes that fit?I'm afraid a security webcam or two might've caught me trying to adjust my belt, tuck in my shirt, a strange routine for a hallway pedestrian at full stride (rewind, replay...).Today though, I compensated with my Wild West leather jacket and beaver fur hat, which I mostly saved for my dramatic exit, and some remark about the horse in the parking garage (a joke of course -- though I did see real goats grazing from my level 5 vantage point).It's not just the no beer (a vow over vodka in Vilnius); I'm getting to the fitness club somewhat more often as well.  [TinkerBell](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/09/tinkering-with-tink.html), my bicycle, hasn't been out much, since the weather got colder.I was sorry to hear of the collision between a cyclist and a P.T. Cruiser in Gresham today.  All around Greater Portland, you can find these little markers, where cyclists have died.  Yet on the whole, I find our drivers to be [more courteous](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/06/pioneer-century.html) and bicycle-aware than average.
