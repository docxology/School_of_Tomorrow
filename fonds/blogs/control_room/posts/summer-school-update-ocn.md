I'm not involved in any of the civic unrest taking place in my City of Portland, although I am commenting from my crow's nest on Facebook.

My experience with Occupy, which echoed the Smedley Butler Hoovervilles, right down to Elk Park, was in no way a positive indicator that I'd be at the vanguard of some smashing fest.  We operated with precision and although we trampled the park, we channeled a lot of amps.  The park bounced back, complete with restrooms.

I'd be for reopening the pavillions (not gazebos exactly), [such as in Colonel Summers](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/06/privatizing-public-parks.html) and kitty corner from Cleveland High School, without ending social distancing.  Maybe these could be dispensaries for the free government cell phones we're all getting along with testing, that will let us avail of social services, and vote.  Just lapsing into science fiction there for a sec.
