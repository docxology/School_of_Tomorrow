I got this new Starbucks coffee-making appliance for [Xmas](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/christmas-2005.html), from me to myself (with a loving endorsement from family), which I've just [stoked](http://www.answers.com/stoke) with Celebes, a favorite bean.

Earlier I met Mark, Don's friend and former student based in [Guatemala](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/wednesday-pauling-house.html).  We three plus [Micheal Sunanda](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/03/wanderers-200637.html) watched [An American Haunting](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429573/) this afternoon, which I'll likely review one day soon.  I'm biased though, having always been a big Sissy Spacek fan (good seeing Sutherland again too, liked him in [JFK](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102138/) among others).

Yes, I saw that front page article about [the beautiful mind guy](http://blog.oregonlive.com/oregonianeditors/2008/03/sad_ending_to_provo_story.html) in Rm. 114, busting his brain to become famous.  Checked into his stuff.  Didn't see many hexagons ([Glenn Stockton](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/global-matrix-wanderers-meeting.html), on the other hand...). Maybe he'd like to present to Wanderers some time.  Information gets lost going through newpapers and web sites, useful though these often are at providing valuable perspectives.

I was telling Mark I think a problem with USA culture is we don't accept aid workers from overseas, think our job is to only export basic expertise.

Think of this [SNL](http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/) skit:  zoom in on some cute uniformed Chinese girl, propping up an SWI (slumped while intoxicated) in some [Gotham](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/post-thanksgiving.html), USA.  "What are you doing?" the curious camera man asks.  "I'm assisting a victim of western capitalism" she replies calmly, and flashes her  badge: Communist Chinese Peace Corps.

Anyway, you get my point.  People are way paranoid here, don't want to get any help, just give it, even where it ain't really needed (at least, not in the form offered).
