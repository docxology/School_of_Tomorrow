However, rather than stir up the Bucky talk again (like there's already [that play](http://bfi.org/our_programs/events/r_buckminster_fuller_the_history_and_mystery_of_the_universe_opens_at_rubicon_theatre_in_ventura_ca)), these science writers have found safe passage through [Epcot](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/09/return-to-moon.html) and its signature Spaceship Earth:Yeates and his colleagues have identified the proteins that play the critical role in how the structure folds in the carboxysome, a protein shell that is the best-known and most-studied microcompartment. The shell has a structure like a soccer ball or the large, iconic dome structure at the Walt Disney World's Epcot Center.
