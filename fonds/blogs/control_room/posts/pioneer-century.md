This year she conquered the course.Part of the reason physically active people live longer on average is they notice changes earlier, when pushing themselves to perform. Many illnesses are far more subject to treatment if caught early.Only a few cyclists marred the event by disrespecting signage and taking to the middle of a busy highway.
