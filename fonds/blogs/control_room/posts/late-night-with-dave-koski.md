Koski is the David Letterman of T-module geometry, where the [T-mod](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86411b.html) is this wedge, both left and right handed, and 1/120th of a rhombic triacontahedron. A recent investor in [ZomeTool](http://zometool.com/), David has been assembling up a storm.recursive construction of T with "remainder tet"The other night, he reported finally getting around to the rhombic dodecahedron, the paradigm IVM shape, and finding it easy to build.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgpVABTEG_DuY8_fYi0jd3UEmB_AT8QhcvU-BKNlDqyehdPNRDzpK6LG9r3oHjC6In02xW7xWrWMezvXge7lFG4qlAloUfqmFbDZtRM-_P263EPa_8Mw3MlhBjUixIHp1lxIv2h/s1600-h/rh_dodeca.jpg)rhombic dodeca with embedded cubeKoski goes [way back](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica5.html) with this stuff, to the life of a scholar in and around Venice and Santa Monica, California, which is when we first met.
