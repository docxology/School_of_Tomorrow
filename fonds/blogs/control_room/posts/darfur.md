This is how many people have historically improved their lives:  by moving.  North Americans are especially familiar with this strategy.The global NGO community shouldn't buy the fiction that only "political prisoners" deserve something called "asylum" (relief from suffering).  Rather, once you're born a human being on Planet Earth, freedom of movement is your birthright, a freedom perhaps curtailed as you grow older and break others' rules, but why does simply being born in Darfur merit a life sentence to that region?This is your planet, as much as the next guy's.I think Darfur represents an ideal set of challenges for [OLPC](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/cp4e-versus-olpc.html) and [P4E](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/07/revisioning-hp4e-synergeo-34590.html) people to walk their various talks.Add wireless using satellite, hand out some laptops (not just to kids).  They're designed to be self-teaching i.e. this is not a "literacy first, then computers" model, but a "literacy through computers" model, combined with peer teaching ala the [South African design](http://www.kusasa.org/).Portable movie theaters, for showing documentaries about the great outer world outside of Darfur (plus the occasional blockbuster) would also be a part of this program, though individual XO screens pretty much serve this same purpose (like that little screen on the seat back in front of you, on a fully equipped Airbus).
