A theme of my writings of late is we need competition in order to remain strong and healthy.Python competes with other agile languages for mindshare, true, but its best hope of staying in the game will involve developing countering forms of operational intelligence [within](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-April/007851.html) Python Nation amongst its many subcultures.We have some of that diversity even now, as evidenced by [Plone](http://plone.org/), a promising sign.Likewise, in the USA's pre-college public schools I believe we suffer from too much inbred complacency within the dominant math teaching ethnicity (not a genetic thing i.e. propagated by textbooks and memes more than genes).[Mixing it up more](http://www.mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5622790&tstart=30), on TV and [computer screens](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/) especially, will help dislodge some of these dangerously retarding bottlenecks and logjams.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhnT_3prgZmUKHU4uFwpxQ2VJ2Q3eXgAsGRW78cb5DVE8BjOAt7JovhvpeLL2PnRp5fNk2YGTDBFhhqOYxWSXAKUn6cTk_tuJgClCIJPsxp28XE6Mu7i05XYehj47In_w6YzUD8/s1600-h/smite.jpg):: mite & two smites by dbk ::
