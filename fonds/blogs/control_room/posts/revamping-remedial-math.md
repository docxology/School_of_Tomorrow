So I'm chawing through a list of "to do's" today, including buying a plumbers' snake, practicing on my shower drain (right now I'm just waiting for the poisons to work -- trying to avoid phoning a specialist from the Yellow Pages).In the midst of such chores, I managed to kick out [Revamping Remedial Math](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1489747&tstart=0), a typos-ridden (but still highly readable) [triptych](http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?va=triptych) regarding my three pronged strategy for upgrading remedial math (the one you get the second time through the wringer):
- have computer science and mathematics vie for the [same talent](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/popping-champaign.html), agreeing with economists that competition breeds out complacency
- make it easier for students to vote with their feet, by staging some version of this competition in their [local area](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/in-favor-of-school-choice.html) and
- let schools wishing to opt out of this sporting spectacle do so, i.e. remain on the sidelines
Those schools choosing to play and wishing [coaching](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5349367&tstart=0) might subscribe to one or more roaming services (e.g. Wanderers based in Linus Pauling's Portland boyhood home), staffed by suitably Olympian role models willing to set up and stage inhouse circus slash recruiting drives with lasting benefits for the hosting Academy.I've been thinking of ways to promote [master teachers](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/education-reform-part-n-n-2.html) into such responsible roles, primarily by forming alliances with the [open source movement](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/more-from-oscon.html), as we want a lot of transparency and freedom in this picture (not forgetting competent engineering) both to build trust and to provide ample opportunities for selfless public service within high performance, challenging scenarios ("be all you can be" in other words).If you're a long time reader of this blog, you've already seen a lot of the blueprints, which also involve promoting closer ties between Native Americans (navams) and the various migrant occupying populations (Anglos, Euros, Afros... Filipinos).So-called Indian Reservations offer naturally attractive training grounds for those wishing to stage a trully American renaissance in our education establishments.  Our heritage in its broadest, most inclusive sense (Mahayana) will by definition include the more cliquey / exclusive sub- and counter- cultures (Hinayana).We have so many treasures.
