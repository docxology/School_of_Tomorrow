Three cheers for MIT Scratch, a great learning environment for young coders.

[This project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/138035016/) provides a quick recap of some of our core concepts.

Remember, the canonical Martian tetrahedron has edges of a full diameter, whereas the Earthling cube has edges = radius, so only half the length.Â  Even so, the cube holds more concrete.

Most of this core content should be review by now, if you're in [middle](http://4dsolutions.net/ocn/winterhaven/section3.html) or high school.
