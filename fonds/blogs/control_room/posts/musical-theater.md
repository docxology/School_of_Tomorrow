I mostly just review movies in my blogs, not trying to be a jack of all genres or anything, but that doesn't mean we don't take in plays, musicals, other performance arts.Among the musicals in recent memory: a light hearted [A Christmas Carol](http://www.portlandtribune.com/features/story.php?story_id=119696451309297600) at the Armory, courtesy of [Rocky](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/etcha-sketch-view.html) of Bridge City Friends; [Jacob and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat](http://www.jesuitportland.org/s/173/jesuit.aspx?pgid=1045) at Jesuit in Beaverton, as guests of [Nancy of Wanderers](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/12/wanderers-2007125.html) (her daughter was truly stellar); and [Wicked](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/12/hollywood-usa.html) at [The Pantages Theater](http://www.pantages-theater.com/) in Hollywood yesterday, thanks to Carol Reilley Urner, my mom.  Plus Tara was actually in the [OATC troupe](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/congratulations-oatc.html) doing Schoolhouse Rock this summer, under the tutelage of Jo Lane.I liked that Canadian show Slings and Arrows (not claiming to have caught every episode), which does a lot to remind us that movie acting and stage acting are a lot alike, yet quite different (somewhat ironic, given this was television).Live performance is more like real life on the fly, is more demanding, as  it's not so easy to do retakes or just piece together short scenes in the editing room.  Movie directors tend to favor actors with live performance backgrounds, or so some will tell you, as less likely to need a lot of coaching (which not all directors are prepared to give).I like that [Buffy](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-tv-talk.html) episode, [Once More with Feeling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_More,_with_Feeling_%28Buffy_episode%29), for it's gentle spoofing of the musical genre.  I found it satirical, yet not mean spirited, given all those darling characters.
