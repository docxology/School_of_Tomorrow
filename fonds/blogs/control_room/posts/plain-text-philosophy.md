One of the dumber arguments some philosophers make, is that one should
refrain from using words with well-established meanings, when inventing new
language games.  "Don't recycle pawn as that's spoken for.  How about fawn?"  They presume to steer one away from the high inertia high value
words.  That's like saying to a little kid:  "don't use gold in your
funny money game, as that's a real adult word, and you're just a little
kid.  Until you have real gold someday, you should say shmold".

That's all preamble to explaining how I see our subcultures, our dialects,
our namespaces, as only partially overlapping, because we do, in fact,
ignore these obstreperous philosophers, and use the words we want,
including gold, energy, vector, gravity, radiation and whatever
else we might get our paws on and hold on to (I'm not saying it's easy to
hold on, given precession and all that).

We all want to build for the ages, and we know that using words like fawn
or shmold (i.e. off-beat, never-heard-of) is going to put us at a
disadvantage.

Fuller gets a lot of notoriety for coining a couple words, such as tensegrity and in-stairs versus out-stairs (he doesn't even take full
credit for dymaxion) but really what he did most is take some high value
high inertia "physics words" (as if any one discipline owns them) and bend
them into his own basket-weaving language of Synergetics.

Tension is "that which holds together" (over very long distances sometimes)
whereas islands of compression (shorter range) keep stuff apart or keep
separate. Synergetics inspires lots of mental cartoons, mental imagery,
along with tactile experiences, to show us what gravity and radiation
mean in that namespace.

Three rods of a tripod press down and want to splay apart (radiational) on
the slippery ice, but a triangular tension band around the base
(gravitational) keeps them from so doing.  Nothing moves, yet we appreciate
the dynamism in this equilibrium.

Did he need Newton's permission to invent this new gravity & precession
suite?  Einstein was bending space-time in new ways.  Isn't "bending space"
just what we do, as science minded?  We make bubbles, we subtract 720
degrees, we systematize.

Hadron collision accounting (CERN stuff) and Synergetics are not "at odds"
so much as they co-develop as different language games (or sets thereof);
different tools, different engines.  Synergetics has a section on its
vocabulary's remoteness, which is intentional, and designed not to
interfere with others pursuing their own disciplines.  But, per my
preamble, he's not about to deny himself access to the gravity well of
high value words, when inking his own thinking.

This idea that language boils down to names, and names point at the thing
they mean (which is how they mean) is not an idea I hold on to.  I let go
of that way of thinking long ago.

My universe therefore has room for many partially overlapping discourses
that flow downhill, like mountain streams, without needing to "point" to
anything.

To take another example:  I cast General Systems Theory as *versus*
Economics, i.e. have GST on your resume and you're more likely to play an
intelligent role in my company.  Economics is too superstitious.  But from
another angle, we're talking about two ways of thinking that cover a lot of
the same bread and butter topics, regarding ecosystem management and so
on.

Spaceship maintenance.  Janitorial services, Global U.

Regarding 2D, 1D and so on: if you see a circle (flat) or rectangle (tennis
court) in your head, where is your viewpoint?  Every line could be a
pencil, every plane a sheet of paper.  Have you ever experienced
"infinitely thin"?  Philosophers claim to picture it on private TV
somewhere.  Chalkboards don't help.

Besides, I always have an angle on any 2D shape.  Even an infinite plane
has a position relative to mine.  I cannot myself be a 2D being, Abbott's
Flatland notwithstanding, not even mentally.  I occupy volume.  Volume is
enclosed by four walls, a tetrahedron.  My Kantian idea of space, even res cogitans, not just res extensa, is 4D.  Four walls.  Four windows.

But ya'll steeped in Cartesianism and its 3-axis octahedron of six vectors,
three basis, three not, are stuck in the a specific 3D talk.  I empathize
about the stuckness part, but readily admit to the utility of the
apparatus.  I use it too, all the time.

But when I'm wanting to communicate Synergetics, I'm all about the four
windows and how anything you see on brain-TV is in a 4D studio.  I can hold
up pieces of paper and pencils and talk about all these shapes, but I have
no need of either infinite extension nor infinite thinness.  It's easier to
just see everything topological as a morphed tetrahedron, rolled flat,
rolled thin, made into a ball, whatever.  It's 4D all the way down.
