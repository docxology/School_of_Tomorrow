I watched tonight's politics from a kicked back arm chair position, tuning in at 6:30 PM PST, Tara coming home from work a little later (she gets dinner thrown in, I dined on cold cereal).I found myself musing about camera angles, how they get those drift shots (slow pans at balcony level or thereabouts).I used to sit in those balconies sometimes, especially in the Senate, then I'd go back to my typewriter and make comments, sometimes send them.  This was in the 1980s.  I was pretty civic minded, curious to see this democracy in action, maybe get a foot in the door, plus we didn't have C-SPAN yet, or at least I didn't.  Those balconies were put there for a reason (to encourage onlookers, and kibitzing).Note to self:  I have to rewind that tape I didn't make and check out that one face in the crowd.  Web site maybe.Leave it to the fiscal conservatives to kill our Disneyland-to-Vegas maglev train, dammit all to hell.Anyway, I agreed with the commentators that we saw a lot of bipartisanship, but is that a good thing?I'm not persuaded "two parties" is really best, seems awfully bipolar, so I do cringe a bit when it gets too bipartisan.  Mono-partisan wouldn't be any better, like at least [we have two](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/wanderers-20061212.html), plus I like the idea of "parties" (whoever thought of calling them that?).Appropriately, I found myself working with another "inaugural ball" [from David Koski](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/another-creature.html), echoing an earlier speech-making occurrence ([inauguration day](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/inaugural-day-ball.html)).
