[Some kind of "spy kid" review, excerpted from elsewhere]Common knowledge that Simpsons, like Google, is heavily infiltrated, in the former case through Korea, as direct infiltration of domestics is forbidden (Google through China).Hence the cleared-for-public-view insider shots of an [NSA listening center](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/morning-edition.html), where Lisa's [worst paranoias](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/08/inner-sanctum-storyboard.html) are confirmed.  Those calls to the boyfriend next door might be monitored.  Emails too.More subtle was the allusion to Marvel comix superhero Spiderman, mixed with [capitalist pig iconography](http://youtube.com/watch?v=714-Ioa4XQw) and long associated with selfishness (Homer) and product fetishes (as in Wired Magazine -- Bart himself a manikin sex toy in some catalogs Flanders never sees (though his boys maybe do)).Some may see the evil hand of Moscow in all this (environ- mentalism leverages such as Greenpeace against NATO), but that paranoia's maybe too old school for most tastes ("old school" as in "during recess -- monkey bar talk").On a more positive note [American Dad](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/family-guy.html) continues to boost recruiting volume through at least the first few hoops, among women especially (per long term equalization goals -- gotta bring guys up to speed).Myself:  recently returned from Lithuania, toured "[KGB museum](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/slow-food-nation.html)" disguised as an overweight American tourist (very persuasive, even to me).
