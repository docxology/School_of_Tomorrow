The patent was granted to Shoji Sadao and assigned to Fuller & Sadao, Inc.  Shoji Sadao was a former student of Fullers.  Sadao was involved in the creation of the icosohedral Dymaxion Map (known as the Raleigh projection) and in the creation of the Expo â€˜67 dome in Montreal.  In Inventions, Fuller claims that the Hexa-Pent dome was developed by Sadao and jointly named by Sadao and Fuller.  The Hexa-Pent dome is preceded by patent 3,114,176 of Alvin E. Miller (17 December 1963).  The Hexa-Pent dome was featured in the May 1972 issue of Popular Science magazine.  The plans for the dome advertised on page 139 of this issue represents the only time Fuller himself sold dome instructions to the general public.
