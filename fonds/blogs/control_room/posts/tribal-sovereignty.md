Whereas neither "tribe" nor "sovereignty" are words of indigenous origin, it is historically the case that immigrants seized jurisdiction at gun point, then proceeded to make life difficult for North Americans wishing to continue lifestyles (including migration patterns) evolved over the past ten thousand years or more.So-called "[tribal sovereignty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_sovereignty)" has been rather difficult to re-establish.  Immigrants and their privileged descendants still have the right to flaunt native laws, even on lands designated "tribal."Oregon / Washington politicians have tended to align with Washington, DC and its Supreme Court on this issue, as imperialist "master race" types in training (snicker).  The label "Indian lover" is like the kiss of death if you want to be president some day, or at least that used to be the common wisdom.However, the tide may be turning, as more ties form between the Silicon Forest and tribes investing in tomorrow's high tech.  Casinos are just the beginning.Stay tuned.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmUCngNA12L8W2WDgV7m0Z9Bi7uywvsbn6Wn6yXApcDpUTIm4q80HzCuiuq5eqxqHxN5XLye8CIHR4J0oYXTa-_RTcFsdpK0okjMxMWTPOF4Y5CaQyQXt4ybbEdVgVT8_1u0E8/s1600-h/outdoorschool.jpg)
