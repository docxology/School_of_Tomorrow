Joe America has a simple model of reality.  The president is a King which is like a superhero, like [Superman](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/01/waiting-for-superman-movie-review.html).  If things go wrong, they're convenient scapegoats, [these Incredibles](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/incredibles-movie-review.html).

In her book [EcoMind](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/14104172891/), Frances Moore Lappé
circles our willingness to "build up" (project celebrities) then "tear down" (celebrate their fall from grace) as one of the energy traps that keeps us living more stupidly than need be.

Scapegoating our purported leaders is a major pass time and a hallmark of our irresponsibility.  In [radical middle politics](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/mark-satin-at-powells-books.html), we don't require super heroics to begin with, just a modicum of personal integrity -- even more than a modicum if one can afford it.

Out of the ruins, out from the wreckage
Can't make the same mistake this time
We are the children, the last generation
We are the ones they left behind

And I wonder when we are ever gonna change it
Living under the fear till nothing else remains

We don't need another hero
We don't need to know the way home
All we want is life beyond the [thunderdome](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=thunderdome)
