Tonight was a small informal session, and I only showed up for part of it, in the middle somewhere.  We talked Internet over optical fiber, the loss in data richness over the last leg of the trip (metal cable), and our own inhouse router woes, there being quite a maze of 'em.  Glenn's son swung into it with gusto, thought maybe he could help sort it out.  Terry is off writing at the beach we're thinking.One thing we wanted to see on the Internet were these stereograms made from paintings by old masters ([link](http://digilander.libero.it/kems/)).Still later, I drove Carol (mom) and Julie (sis) back to their hotel, our pad not having sufficient floorspace, given all the offices.I'm still reflecting on the apparent ability of [Mayan civilizations](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/vip-visits-pkl.html) to manage paradigm transitions in a self aware, non-catastrophic mode.  At least, that seemed to be what was behind the intentional "decomissionings" of old HQS, with the new ones going in above.  The old became the new basement, atop yet deeper basements, of world ball games gone by.
