So this Book of Secrets [episode](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/national-treasure-movie-review.html) begins with the phony end of the Civil War and the assassination of President Lincoln, resulting in contemporary speculation about whether Thomas Gates was a co-conspirator with Booth.  However, given our omniscient camera viewpoint, we already know Gates was killed by KGC operatives.The funniest moment in this film is when Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) successfully pisses off the Buckingham Palace security guards (all a part of his clever plan).  In cinematographic terms, the car chase through London is a groundbreakingly impressionistic blend of sights and sounds.Perhaps his and Abigail's acting out will remind tourists to keep their family squabbling less public -- shouting on your cell phone may also be rude, plus have some respect when you dress to visit holy places and shrines OK?  Let's all just try to behave a little less foolishly shall we?On a more serious note, the film at least alludes to JFK's tenure and assassination.So I eventually tired of all the pseudo-adult bickering (ex partners trapped in old arguments).  Yes, relationships are like puzzles, and so why are these premier puzzle solvers and translators so bad at them then?  And why was the City of Gold built to look like a tacky Hollywood movie set?  Poor craftsmanship apparently (lotsa leaks).We came home to the news of the cowardly, insane assassinations in Pakistan.  Maturity is in short supply on Animal Planet, especially [among humans](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/back-from-catalina.html).I cooled my jets in the jacuzzi and was more upbeat when later posting to [edu-sig](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-December/008385.html).I also joined a [Polyhedron elist](http://www.mathconsult.ch/lists/cgi/listinfo/polyhedron) today and posted some appreciative remarks regarding the recent Koski filings.  I see other names I recognize in the archives.
