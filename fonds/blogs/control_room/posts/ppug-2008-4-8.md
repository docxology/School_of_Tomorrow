We're getting briefed on [IPython](http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/FrontPage), an old fashioned looking high contrast CRT style front end to the Python interpreter.There're some gotchas plus the pager screwed up a few times, but I get the feeling our Intel guy is pretty happy with it, having done a really thorough evaluation.I'm no IPython guru, so it's news to me, all these automagical functions.About fourteen of us?  Hi Dylan... Jason.Not planning to stay long tonight -- too much on my plate (PPUG = Portland Python Users Group, check us out at the [Python.org Wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PortlandPythonUserGroup)).Jason wrote [his own shell](http://discorporate.us/projects/sliderepl/), based on "batteries included," to help with presentations.  It includes the concept of "slides," canned content appended to the shell's source, which feeds the shell at runtime.  I interrupted with some vocal praise at this point, then went back to blogging.
