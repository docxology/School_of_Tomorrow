I've noticed for awhile now that the idea of a
"global grid" is nowadays said to be an Asian
and, more specifically, a Chinese idea.
Not mentioned here in this Bloomberg vid, is
Bucky's World Game making the global grid
a top priority.

I guess Bucky is just too scary and troubling a
figure to bring up casually in corporate business
circles.

The vid also fails to mention one of the oldest
HVDC lines, from Oregon to California.
