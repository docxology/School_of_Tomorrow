In this obscure [Ken Russell film](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/10/tommy-movie-review.html), a bunch of over-privileged white people with servants to wait on them and nothing important to do, drive each other crazy in various ways, only to return to "normal" when the sun reappears.  Lord Byron and company, but no Ada.  I'm hoping for more movies about [Ada](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/adaessay.html).
