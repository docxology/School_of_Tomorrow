Given [ongoing ops in Bangalore](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9659117) to raise living standards for children by sharing a more intelligent STEM curriculum ([OLPC](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/12/exoterica.html) an influence), I'm seeing a next campaign shaping up.

You may remember my [Kite campaign](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/02/polishing-resume.html), a connecting of dots that included [Alexander Graham Bell's kites](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/octet-truss.html).  This campaign will be similar in that many dots will connect, and many light bulbs will go on.

[Before that](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/06/end-qyooban-embargo.html) it was "Aristotle was right, remember the Mite", homage to space-filling tetrahedrons (Sommerville a champion). 

[The gist](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9662780) of the new campaign:

Men had thirty years to appreciate Synergetics and a few of them did, but mostly the Bucky stuff, being about livingry and not killingry, is about "girlie man" stuff i.e. is "for girls" i.e. "patriarchy [sic] is too dumb to get it" (as in:  too lazy, too slow -- a non-virtuous kind of dumb).
This taps into [pent up fury](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/08/lucy-movie-review.html) against patronizing men, plus helps counter [the Barbie Syndrome](http://gizmodo.com/barbie-f-cks-it-up-again-1660326671).  Works well in India, but other places too.

More on Facebook.  Stay tuned. [Wicca an influence](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/more-polemics.html) as well.
