:: earth day in pdx, 2011 ::

I got a call from 12th and Stark, where we mostly think of the abandoned school, which I'm thinking our Ministry could take over (might just leave it as is, like a war monument).  I met up with the architect.  

I wandered about running my camera, juxtaposing the dome and the tepee in that classic retro way.  So Portlandia.  Good use of tension, with those tetrahedrons pulling.  FNB had a booth, I found out later.

Matt returned my call.  Maybe next weekend, we'll have that beer.

I'd just been paying my respects to one James Jameson in [a philosophy thread](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Wittrs/message/6606) and who should happen to be there, along our later route, but the man himself.  Even Lindsey hadn't known he was back in town, and they're FB friends (LW and I are not, though we were once and might someday be again).

Mostly I'm just some expat American, roaming among my people, somewhat on the quiet side.  I don't play the guitar or sing much.  Glad to enjoy a bright sunny day, even with the allergies kicking in, and then the fire after dark (though it never really gets dark in the city, thanks to "[light pollution](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/escaping-light-pollution.html)").

Today, it's Easter.
