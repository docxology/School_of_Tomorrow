These came up in a meeting at Bagdad today -- like the cars but higher, and sent to remote areas a lot of the time.  Just for surveillance of course, not psycho dark ages stuff from some Dr. Evil horror show.   True, not everyone likes the idea of being on HDTV.  Low flying, over [criminal stockpiles](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/08/menwfz.html)...  what do we choose to call "against humanity" then?  Does "prohibition" mean "no nukes"?  A lot of schools think that way, yes.  Verification remains a part of the picture, especially over a region as large as North America.
