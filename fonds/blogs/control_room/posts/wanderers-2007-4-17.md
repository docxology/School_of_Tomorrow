Last night it was my privilege to present about [Python Nation](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/brought-to-you-by.html) to Wanderer mathematicians and engineers, practicing and retired, some with years of programming experience e.g. both [Bill](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/01/wanderers-2007131.html) (electronics) and [Barry](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/wanderers-20061114.html) (banking) have an active knowledge of assembly language programming.Given I usually teach this stuff to middle and high schoolers, I found last evening's venue a valuable opportunity to gear things a little differently. Jon made us coffee. Wine and beer were also available.Part of my preparation process was to remove pretty much all traces of Python from the Toshiba laptop to start with, and install the 2.5.1 release candidate at the start of the talk. I wanted that "nothing up the sleeves" sense of bare Python.Then I wrote, saved and imported all my code in real time, while projecting with the Optoma -- except when showing off such canned Standard Library modules as math and cmath.I've saved the gist of my presentation as [wanderers.py](http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/wanderers.py) at my [4D Solutions/CP4E website](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html).Followup:[Class 0](http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/wanderers_class0.py) (April 26)[Class 1](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/viztoyz1/viztoyz1.html) (May 3)[Class 2](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-May/007926.html) (May 10)[Class 3](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/py4www.html) (May 24)
