BritishFrenchYoutube and similar services have revolutionized "information harvesting" in that I'm able to get the actual raw recordings, don't have to read a bunch of writing all the time.So like here I'm consulting British and French sources respectively, noting how the former is to the point, makes short work of this "singularity" business, whereas the French are more obtuse, more likely to leave coded messages, meaning I have to keep going over the material.I appreciate the global reach of these services yet understand they're still in their infancy in so many dimensions.
