Properly disinfecting surface water sources kills E. Coli:

Systems using [surface water](http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-education2/8-surface-water-quality.htm),
 rather than ground water, are required to take extra steps to protect 
against bacterial contamination because surface water sources are more 
vulnerable to such contamination. At a minimum, all systems using 
surface waters must disinfect. Disinfection will kill E. coli O157:H7.  [[source](http://www.g3e-ewag.ca/programs/Puits/underground_water.html)]
So should Portland blame its reservoirs or the lack of sufficient treatment? 

Contractors are in place to disconnect our hundred year old system, [not because it's broken](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/04/empty-theatrics.html), but because the EPA says we have to.

Do underground, versus surface sources, also contain E. Coli sometimes?  [Yes](http://www.g3e-ewag.ca/programs/Puits/underground_water.html).

Given E. Coli has nothing to do with why the EPA wants this system shut down, we at least have a litmus test:  any politician using the E. Coli scare to make points for closing is willfully clueless and a self identified lackey for the contractors / businesses standing to gain financially from the EPA's one-size-fits all ruling.
