This pipeline has become a focus of the AFSC ([ACLU too](https://www.aclu.org/school-prison-pipeline)).

[Private for-profit companies](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/13/arizona-business-cca-school-to-prison-pipeline) are contracting with so-called "states" to provide in-school security personnel who fulfill functions formerly performed by vice principals and guidance counselors.

Instead of going to the principal's office, you might be sent to [a law enforcement agent](https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform-free-speech-human-rights-racial-justice/cop-assaults-elementary-school).  A bed in a [for-profit prison](http://www.salon.com/2013/09/23/6_shocking_revelations_about_how_private_prisons_make_money_partner/) has your name on it in short order.

"Undocumented humans" are also funneled to detention centers managed by these same companies.

The neo-fascist "state" of Arizona is an example a political jurisdiction that has gutted itself and outsourced state functions to [corporate entities](https://afsc.org/category/topic/profit-prisons).

The question of whether we still have a "USA" is up for grabs at this point in time.

Washington, DC, never a state, has declared wars against a number of peoples around the world without the consent of the governed.

Medal of Freedom winner Buckminster Fuller wrote "The USA we have known is now bankrupt and extinct." (Grunch of Giants, St. Martins Press, 1983).  Do they read that in American History class?
