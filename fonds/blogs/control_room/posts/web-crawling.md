Everyone knows the world does not really operate according to how textbooks say it does.  The sovereignties are paper tigers, dependent on more invisible institutions that prop them up.

A couple quotes from Critical Path by our Medal of Freedom winner:

In our comprehensive reviewing of published, academically accepted history we continually explore for the invisible power structure behind the visible kings, prime ministers, czars, emperors, presidents, and other official head men, as well as for the underlying, hidden causes of individual wars and their long, drawn-out campaigns not disclosed by the widely published and popularly accepted causes of those wars. 

The U.S.A. is not run by its would-be 'democratic' government. All the latter can do is try to adjust to the initiatives already taken by LAWCAP’s great corporations. Nothing could be more pathetic than the role that has to be played by the President of the United States, whose power is approximately zero.
I recently shared these passages on Facebook, in conjunction with [this exhibit](https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/10/15/wiki-o15.html).

I learned a lot about Gaudi today, over at Glenn's.  Such an amazing individual.  One of his secrets is he saw possibilities in the indigenous crafts and skills of Catalonia.

He was more of a structural engineer than most architects, studying the transmission of forces with string meshes and bags of shot.  His curvilinear style has become more popular now that computer software is doing more of the grunt work.
