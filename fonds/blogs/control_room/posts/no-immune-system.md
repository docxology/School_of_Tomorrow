Excerpts from my postings to Facebook:

People expect so much from politicians. The institutions are what's broken 
though, starting with voting itself.

A federal contest to come up with 
the best open source not black box voting system with auditable / 
analyzable results, which the government would then adopt and own, 
not outsource, might help resurrect that "democracy" idea.

In the meantime, states need their own foreign 
policies and workarounds. DC is an obnoxious capital with no legitimacy 
at this point. Too many irregularities in the voting, [per Palast](https://youtu.be/U2pUmcvOB0M) etc.

Not talking about "fraudulent voters", talking about purging voter roles
 by the millions, Rove-style, thanks to deliberately sloppy matches.

Neither mainstream party wants to look at that (except Black Caucus) 
ergo USA is dead, long live USSA, the Imposter State.

I don't think it makes much sense to have a healthcare debate and 
exclude public health / CDC type epidemics such as Zika and Oxy.

Or the 
quality of food in government facilities, be those schools, prisons, 
hospitals or military.

Focusing purely on the nuclear family and how 
family physician type medicine will be provided is letting politicians 
off the hook in too many dimensions.

We need to see if there's any 
interest in public health.

My impression is the FDA is like in 
Idiocracy, helpless to protect Americans against the merchants of bad 
health.

Uncle Sam has no immune system?

Probably
 [a 3rd party](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/03/n8v-american.html) would do well if it focused very concertedly on the 
infrastructure of voting itself. Why don't public schools at least, have
 voting machines 24/7 that they get to work out with, come to 
understand?

Or is it that the public should not understand the vital 
infrastructure of democracy (exactly right, but our party could change 
that).

As campaign manager, I'd widely show the new Palast film, The 
Best Democracy Money Can Buy, about the Rove-style purge of some 
millions of voters in the build-up to the most recent presidential 
election, on the pretense that the algorithms were protecting against 
"double voting", somehow a common practice in a population hard pressed 
to vote once in most cases.Â 

This magic trick, like the one in Florida in Bush vs Gore, likely swung 
the election, but no the Russians are to 
blame (we'd mock that "look the other way" campaign, to distinguish 
ourselves from Dems).

We'd probably also talk about Apartheid a lot and 
advertise our friendly ties with South Africa, home of Die Antwoord (a 
campaign needs music).
