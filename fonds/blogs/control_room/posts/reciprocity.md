Excerpt from the Wanderers list...

...Yeah, the Army Corps of Engineers has identified some significant projects in Iraq that'd serve a civilian purpose.  There's the case of a weak dam, the possibility of flooding...  also, the Iraqi and Iranian grids connect in like 9 places and if those new Iranian nuke plants generate as much juice as they're supposed to... even Turkey and far off Europe could benefit.

I'm surprised the US hasn't stepped up to the plate and volunteered to help with the uranium purification -- what better way to monitor than to be integral.  Reciprocal agreements with Iranians, whereby the IAEA would be empowered to inspect US nuclear facilities, any time, would be a huge confidence building measure.  Any administration at all serious about peace in the Middle East would be eagerly looking at non-proliferation by this means.

Of course Russia is closer, geographically, and already helps supply India with civilian-grade fissionable materials, so it makes sense that the US is backing Russia's overtures...
