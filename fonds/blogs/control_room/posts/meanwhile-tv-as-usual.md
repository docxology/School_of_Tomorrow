Crazy TV:  the nutcase killer is lionized in puffed up police 
punditry as "wanting to weaken the United State" i.e. this was an 
international event involving a terrorist organization (Mr. ISIS pops 
up, out of cold storage, right here on CBS).

This isn't another
 brain dead victim of our zombie media, not a completely out of his 
depth gun nut with a case of the Columbines. No, this is international 
warfare, as this veteran (so many of them veterans) was on the brink of 
joining ISIS, or no, he'd joined 
already, no wait... the details won't matter, now that the link has been
 made (for us, by the media mogul caliphate).

Another worn out husk of an NPC (non-playable dead end scenario, no 
more good cards) of the type we used to see in a medical facility 
(called an asylum or sanitarium) and not necessarily in a jail.  
Cuckoos' Nest if you wanna be unkind.

Then compassionate 
America decided to give them all shopping carts and to push them out on the 
streets.  Vets get shown the same door. "Go enjoy vulture capitalism, 
they need to feed."  "Go be in some Breaking Bad episode."  "Have a midlife opioid crisis."

We made a distinction back then, in the old 
country (the one before this one), between a mental case and an enemy
 soldier, also between a mental case and an international terrorist.

Now we live in Crazy TV Time, wherein every mutant monster, 
every victim of some hideous epigenetic meme virus disease (some go back
 centuries), is really who they think they are, in their dying rants 
and manifestos.

We get to be in their world.  Lucky us.

Now the
 crazies get to help dictate, be a central part of,  some epic inter 
religious violent melodrama, starring heroic fighters who will keep us 
safe, praise Allah.
