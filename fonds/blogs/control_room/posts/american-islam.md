There's nothing to stop Islam from being a politically constructive player on the USA domestic scene. [Malcolm X](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7579008&tstart=0) was a trail blazer in this regard.These emerging schools needn't take direction from overseas. As a Quaker, I look forward to working with a pacifist branch that understands the Lamb's War, i.e. we're in a battle for hearts and minds, fighting against fear, corruption and tyranny. Outward weapons are for losers.The Pentagon is shifting gears to focus less on nukes and more on psychological warfare, a positive development (long overdue), and not inconsistent with a warrior class value system, per many Asian examples.The idea of a war for freedom and liberty isn't specifically Christian (indeed, many Christians hate our freedoms as surely as some Muslims do).As a secular state, we're free to learn from Islamic schools about how to resist terrorism and parasitism in all their ugly forms.
