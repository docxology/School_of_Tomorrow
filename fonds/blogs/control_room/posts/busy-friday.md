Right, not [just Mondays](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/busy-monday.html) get busy.Today, after getting Tara to school, I rode shotgun with [officer Bader](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/6/258/517) on my hospital beat, an old playing field, but always new and different.  I thought she was great, very X-Files, plus still high off her management workshop for [360compass](http://360compass.com/), a [4dsolutions](http://www.4dsolutions.net/) affiliate.Then Diane swung by with mega-groceries, with a Freddies list for more.  Turns out we frequent the same store but hardly ever run into each other (go figure).  At Costco we physically collided, though with no ribs broken.  All this food is for Willamette Quarterly Meeting, as my closer readers may already have guessed.Then came the visit to the UPS Store up on Hawthorne, to send certified mail to the Governor of California's office.  This is about my high school buddy, in the slammer since 1981 for murder one, and he's not the only criminal I've come to know over the years, deserving of another chance in this life.OK, Luci's here now (both parents attorneys), and it's time that we finish packing and be gone, leaving house under guard (smile).I'm tenting this time; no one needs to hear me snore in the forest (an old philosophers' joke).
