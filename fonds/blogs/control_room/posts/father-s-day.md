Tara kindly offered to make me breakfast this morning (I took her up on it).  This was a kind of role reversal, as she puttered in the kitchen [while I watched cartoons](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/06/fathers-day.html) (Duckman:  Apocalypse Not, Season 3 DVD from Movie Madness).Now I'm back to [working the beat](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/on-job.html) (on duty today) while she forges ahead with Six Feet Under.I offered PSF a [chunk of flextegrity](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3564971422/in/set-72157607350755934/) for the OSCON Python booth as a model of "batteries included" (actually, more of a visualization than a model -- [thinking MVC](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/09/more-curriculum-writing-re-mvc.html) here).Yesterday I backed up 5 DVDs worth of images ([Portland Knowledge Lab](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/some-night-shots.html) stuff) plus uploaded [Dawn's Journey](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157619706764164/), her trip [to Glastonbury](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/05/sky-camp.html) and related destinations.I had a brief chat with a professor regarding the scene in Iran earlier today (she's also a gender and management consultant).  She's understandably disappointed.OK, it's [time to ride Tinkerbell](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3619912157/), unclog a few pipes.  I'm wearing my Star Trek T-shirt (Alexia's actually -- original cast), which should help me blend in (lots of Trekkies in this town, if you ever need to go under cover for some reason -- maybe go for that [pointy ears look](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3620260698/), or copy [Uhura's tattoo](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/star-trek-movie-review.html)).No wait, senior moment, this is my Beatles T-shirt, a present from the Lott family.  Same advice:  blend in to Portland's happening music scene, pretend you're an aging rock star, or maybe a blues guy of some kind.  Leave the slide rule at home.Back from my ride...On cue (cuz I'm the dad), some kitchen sink parts failed, a long running battle, need a professional, but Uncle Sam has been kidnapped by scrooges who [make him fight](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html) to pay ransom, so I make do with duct tape.  These are serious problems though, if you live here.  But then I've got it better than most [Global U students](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/futurism-revisited.html), grossly under-served by an underpowered curriculum (not geeky enough, need [more GST](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/general-systems-theory.html)).Rich kids in the West Hills get their anglophone live-in tutors from the Philippines, probably know [Pythonic math](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html) already.  Working class types, just making ends meet, learn rickety old Newtonian stuff and maybe next to nothing about polyhedra ([no MITEs even](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/high-school-melodrama.html)).I was talking with Lindsey [at Angelo's](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/workflow.html) awhile back, about ways to maybe fix that.  She was looking at Free Geek and a return to personal tutoring, after some years in the corporate sector.  I posted some [more thoughts on that](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/patient-tracking.html) earlier today, before turning to [those hospitals](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/patient-tracking.html) again.  Giving up [on PPS](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/pps-has-friends-in-silicon-forest.html) is not part of the plan though, as I was emailing to Patrick (on Jennifer 2, running Hardy Heron).David, who does systems for Lewis & Clark, confirms a fried bus or mobo is to blame for [Jackalope's downing](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/jackalope-down.html) (not a software issue).  I've got the carcass in a bag.Rose and Tara ended a fine Father's Day by cooking a take 'n bake pizza, while I wrote in Facebook about my role as freshman senator in a "fledgling dictatorship" i.e. Python Nation, and published a new web page on [Arthur Seigel's Pygeo](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeo.html) (a plan I'd mentioned to AR, one of our MVPs in said network).Mom is enroute back from Pendle Hill, routing through Chicago.
