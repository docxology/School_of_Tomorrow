Readers of this blog may remember a certain Business Accelerator downtown near Tillakum Crossing.

Anyway, I rode my bicycle there on Monday. I had [Tinkerbell](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/09/tinkering-with-tink.html) for years, a blog character, then a rebuilt racer Lindsey tricked out (lost on the front line, [doing FNB duty](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/postmortem-fnb.html)).  This new one has no name yet, is a gift from Flextegrity Sam.

We rode together, the bike and I, to the [Monday Night Flying Circus](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/06/pro-python-propaganda.html) venue.

Portland Python Users Group at Urban Airship is a monthly event, and has been concerned about standing room only occasions, judging from announcements I've seen.

Thursdays have been a teaching night for me, however Mondays have been a go.  My PPUG (and before that PORPIG) reviews occur throughout my blogs.

Showcased the [@Raspberry_Pi](https://twitter.com/Raspberry_Pi) running Pi3D at [@PDXCodeGuild](https://twitter.com/PDXCodeGuild) on Monday! [https://t.co/sOmbeLN478](https://t.co/sOmbeLN478)

This time:  given the new bicycle, I didn't trust myself with the Air, so packed a tiny Pi with all peripherals but the screen.  Said Raspberry Pi is a lotta bang for the buck anyway.

I was showcasing its GPU on the HDTV using the Python 3.x version of the Pi3D library, running python3 CodeCastle.py and like that.  I was but one exhibitor among many, not giving a lightning talk or anything, though we're looking at [adopting that format](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/at-circus.html), at least for a time slice.
