Greetings FNBers --The trailer is in the usual location.  Chefs should bethinking about acorn squash and kale as major ingredients.  Also have pomegranates, other fruitsand root vegetables.Food prep on Thursdays at the Quaker Meeting househas been happening since the beginning of September,except on Thanksgiving when we made other arrangements.**I'll be there at the usual time (sorry, was late last time)to open up, return the soup ladle, and look for some leftbehind plastic.  I'll wash the pots and await the chefs.If you're volunteering for Tuesday, you know where to go for the trailer (blue house on Harrison) and OTY ingredients.  Greetings from OTY.LW still gearing up to check possible CSA site in Yamhill.I filled in as hauler per prior plan.
