A wronged astronaut, Earl, breeds and trains mutant aliens to avenge his suffering.  Not everything goes according to plan, his daughter Josie, her boyfriend Darby, also getting in on the act.A spoof of space invader films, other genres, [a Bill Plympton cartoon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0277909/), verging on horror, except funny (and obscene), not least because of the brilliant sound track.There's a "body parts" planet, noses versus fingers mostly, although this turns out to be a clever cover story designed to win the trust of the evil Dr. Frubar.Be sure to catch The Plympton Diaries on the same DVD, a week to week documentary about the making of this film, in some ways a tribute to the animals who've been wronged as a part of the space program.Wanderer Don used to take swimming lessons with Bill and his older sister Sally, back when they were all kids.
