Puerto Rico could send reps to Oregon for a look at Vote by Mail system we have, not perfect, but why not start with one of the best.

Some will say it's a bit preemptive for a former territory, Oregon, to welcome [Puerto Rico](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-last-colony-movie-review.html) to the Union, as 51st state.

After some hundred years, I'm glad we have that sorted out.

Welcome.
