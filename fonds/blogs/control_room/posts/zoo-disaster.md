The LA Times today is reporting on page one about an irresponsible zoo that doesn't know how to contain its tigers.Visitors whom the tiger mauled to death, and the animal star killer, shot dead by police, paid a very high price indeed.How about no more captive tigers in the San Francisco Zoo until 3008?  That'd be my idea of justice well served.Update:  I watched the news conference from my treadmill @ 24 Hour Fitness.  Casualties at that time:  two killed (one human, one non), two injured (human).
