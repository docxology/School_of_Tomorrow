&lt;p&gt;Today I dive back into data science world, with a new cohort.&amp;nbsp; This curriculum is primarily not by me; I add some wrinkles.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m happy with the content though, and don&#39;t mind using the canned slide decks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the embedded video I make it sound like people using decks by others is either a no-no or has never been thought of before I came along.&amp;nbsp; On the contrary, many a corporate training, say an onboarding, was canned long ago as a PowerPoint.&amp;nbsp; Every day, people sit through presentations of slides done by people other than the presenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, in wanting to inject my own contribution into the mix, I get to stand back and take a look at current and/or best practices, regarding slide decks and the protocols around sharing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/feeds/4854158789880395048/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment/fullpage/post/10436423/4854158789880395048' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4854158789880395048'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4854158789880395048'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/12/slides-again.html' title='Slides Again'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/72OOv64Eld8/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4209879538429711382</id><published>2022-12-05T10:35:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2022-12-15T07:49:49.215-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Advice Column</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps the hallmark of the &quot;modern European nation&quot; in terms of liberalism is 
it doesn&#39;t conceive of itself as being in orbit around (controlled by) 
any one ethnicity (whatever the one).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel stands out as the hallmark 
ethnic state, and as such is the envy of many.  But
 then Israel is not in Europe and Saudi Arabia is just as ethnocentric 
in its own way (we should talk about Britain more).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American ideal 
is closest to having &quot;race creed&quot; etc. not matter on paper, even if in 
practice people are jerks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why any talk of &quot;Ukraine for 
Ukrainians, make us be in Europe now!&quot; sounds so oxymoronic.  The 
Europeans think:  &quot;you must be civilized first, and treat the Russians 
as equals&quot; to which the Ukrainians reply &quot;wait, don&#39;t you hate the 
Russians too?&quot; which to many is the clinching argument.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we need is
 more agreement on &quot;totalitarianism is bad&quot; (dystopian) without all the 
old branding.  We&#39;ve outgrown the old comic books.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I&#39;d remind Ukrainians of is that we&#39;re ethnically Russian over here too, in America.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only Russian, obviously.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of Ukes. Lots of Ruskies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve learned to live together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I think Euros falsely conclude, based on clown shows in DC and recycled NATO propaganda, that America is foundationally Russophobic. To those with such a shallow understanding I&#39;d say: keep digging. History is more complicated than good versus bad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you moralize a lot (or too quickly?), consider you might be a dummy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;XREF:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I had a wealth of education programs to choose from, some synchronous, some asynchronous.&amp;nbsp; One should always prioritize the now or never synchronous opportunities, as a rule of thumb.&amp;nbsp; However &quot;opportunity&quot; means &quot;affordably passed up&quot; i.e. if it feels mandatory maybe they shouldn&#39;t pretend you had a choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know the law has you pinned down when your only button is Accept, in the face of endlessly scrolling legalize.&amp;nbsp; What they know about you is you might sue if you find a loophole.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Accept that we have our defenses arrayed against you&quot; says the button.&amp;nbsp; You press it, if you want to continue with the installation and boot up experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can tell, I&#39;m in favor of the shorter open source user end licenses, which boil down to &quot;without warranty, go for it&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Then you learn to trust the various scouts as to what&#39;s malware or irkware or nagware.&amp;nbsp; People have different levels of tolerance, with some motivated by sheer curiosity to visit the dark side of the dark side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source is more than that though and I don&#39;t mean to short circuit or take lightly the long hours of philosophizing distilled in discussions of the GPL and so on.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve attended live Richard Stallman talks on more than one occasion, with Portland once billed as a capital of open source, back when that meant a lot to the computer literate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What I ended up doing with my morning was engaging in telecommunications about pending business regarding acquiring a dog.&amp;nbsp; I was reminded of ducking out of a meeting at SNEC&#39;s founding, in DC, at a house hosted by R. Chu.&amp;nbsp; E.J. Applewhite followed me out to the sidewalk, curious to overhear what conversation might be important enough to take me out of this synchronous opportunity.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overhearing my side, he assumed my wife and I were talking about a servant.&amp;nbsp; We were actually talking about a dog.&amp;nbsp; My wife was in an awkward situation, having taken Sarah (our mutt) to a Quaker gathering, a camp, where said dog was not on her best behavior, or such is my recollection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was amused Ed was thinking that (that I had a servant), or pretended to, and that he got me telling the truth in short order.&amp;nbsp; SNEC = Synergeticists of the Northeast Corridor, an acronym since jettisoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I&#39;m going to hop on Protonmail and write about Dark Horse comics (not as a know-it-all mind you, more as a know-nothing).&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll be overlapping with the TrimTabbers, who were meeting about Applewhite&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Cosmic Fishing&lt;/i&gt; this morning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was one of my synchronous opportunities.&amp;nbsp; This will be another way of jumping in on that thread, asynchronously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/166212625190115420'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/166212625190115420'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/11/synchronous-vs-asynchronous.html' title='Synchronous Vs Asynchronous'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1330720446878127402</id><published>2022-11-21T08:23:00.004-08:00</published><updated>2022-11-22T07:11:15.976-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Conehead</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/EpE4Wv9ZXFg&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EpE4Wv9ZXFg/hqdefault.jpg);&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ll summarize these couple hours so you don&#39;t need to watch them, not that I&#39;d try to talk you out of it.  Times 2 speed?  Or sample.  That&#39;s what I do a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I come off like a conehead, a term you may not know, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coneheads&quot;&gt;time for Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, right?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More literally, I&#39;m holding the camera very close to my face in extreme closeup, but from an angle that makes my forehead towering, so I look like a conehead, and to some extent sound like one too, no doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The backstory is I only got clear on the time of this event right when I&#39;d just decided to walk to &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2022/10/urbit-food-pod.html&quot;&gt;a food pod&lt;/a&gt; for food cart Thai food, then come home and fix Carol&#39;s dinner.&amp;nbsp; Dr. D. was in the mix.&amp;nbsp; How could I do that and be on Zoom at the same time?&amp;nbsp; Answer:&amp;nbsp; phone apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve used Zoom for years, but never saw a need to cram all that bandwidth into the palm of my hand.&amp;nbsp; However with Bluetooth and Airpods, not only was I able to tune in the meeting, I was able to jump in as a talking conehead.&amp;nbsp; Peter Meisen was in a similar situation:&amp;nbsp; surrounded by peep noises, yet poised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yes, I managed to move forward on several fronts (cooking and other logistics) while having my head popping up somewhere near Philadelphia.&amp;nbsp; CJ couldn&#39;t be there this time.&amp;nbsp; Shrikant was his usual good humored self.&amp;nbsp; Everyone was pleasant.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re very civilized back east, although Shrikant said he&#39;d spent a decade in the Pacific Northwest and could attest to our having our own version of culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was all thumbs however, this being my first time to use Zoom in its phone app format.&amp;nbsp; I kept swiping the entire app off the screen, meaning I&#39;d kill it and have to sign in again.&amp;nbsp; That happened at least twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is I&#39;ve been tracking (as in lurking in on, usually after the fact on YouTube) this &lt;i&gt;52 Living Ideas&lt;/i&gt; meetup for some time now, as I recount in my self intro.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve hosted backyard meetups of folks loosely known as Wanderers, with Shrikant and/or CJ on the iPad, sharing the picnic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the indefinite article &quot;A&quot; in my title because when it comes to &quot;political spectra&quot; we have a good many.&amp;nbsp; You might not know it to hear people talk though.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tradition, only one pole or axis is used and is labeled Right versus Left.&amp;nbsp; How one piles on after that depends a lot on subculture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my neck of the woods, juxtaposing &quot;Conservative versus Liberal&quot; atop &quot;Right versus Left&quot;, would make some kind of sense, but for how long has it, and for how long will it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I sometimes perk up my ears when I stumble upon some meta discussions of what &quot;Left&quot; and &quot;Right&quot; mean.&amp;nbsp; I was looking at that topic here on the web as long ago as &lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/archives/52&quot;&gt;my Tower of Babel essay&lt;/a&gt; of the 1990s, one of the first in my USA OS series.&amp;nbsp; OS = Operating System.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a computer geek of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The theory was:&amp;nbsp; Left is for Entropy, and why we seem to shift left, more left, more left over time, is because of thermodynamics and dissipation.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a sense of stuff leaking away.&amp;nbsp; The Left inevitably makes gains because evil chaos is winning, was the point, of these ostensibly Right wingers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I say &quot;wingers&quot; flash on airplanes too sometimes, flying in formation maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a different thesis, but it&#39;s similar:&amp;nbsp; on the Left is where we experiment, as we&#39;re impelled to shift our weight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conceit of some on the Right is that we have the option to just stay put, as if freezing everything while we figure out what&#39;s going on, were a real possibility.&amp;nbsp; Even a president can&#39;t make that happen.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re talking natural law, aren&#39;t we?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many on the Right say to teachers: &quot;how dare you experiment with my children&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Well yeah, it does sound demonic when phrased like that.&amp;nbsp; How about:&amp;nbsp; every generation is a next set of experiments in living, we hope thriving.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re looking for the best ways forward.&amp;nbsp; Much trial and error is involved.&amp;nbsp; We bark up &quot;wrong trees&quot; in the millions, not seeing the forest for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s like when you have a base camp with a cozy fire, but need to move the base camp towards some destination. Like they said in the est Training, when it comes to purpose, just think of always going further west.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t ask why; it&#39;s a metaphor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore send out scouts to find the most promising next trails.&amp;nbsp; They report back.&amp;nbsp; We have a meeting to establish consensus.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes, a wandering band will branch or fork, depending on longer term objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Left is the perpetually scouting phase, where some come back with reports of dire dangers, awesome wonders, or don&#39;t come back at all.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s where the sense of entropy comes from.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Casting one&#39;s nets forward in time yields a mixed bag, and it&#39;s up to the campers to assemble the incoming info, the feedback, in ways that advantage them.&amp;nbsp; In other words, the curators conserve and build traditions, a fancy name for habits.&amp;nbsp; Programs.&amp;nbsp; Engrams.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionalists conserve artifacts and memories.&amp;nbsp; In Bayesian terms, they represent collective &quot;priors&quot; i.e. the current sense of things based on experiences to date.&amp;nbsp; Quakers might think in terms of Meetings for Business.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call them &quot;on the Right&quot; because they&#39;re the orthodoxy, the accumulated wisdom of the ages.&amp;nbsp; In theory that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those on the Left may feature a lot of younger and bolder personality types, who with age become slower to jump into the action pell-mell.&amp;nbsp; The older Right oft times empathizes with the younger whippersnappers who remind them of themselves, closer to the start of whatever careers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, this template or boilerplate is the basis of stereotype type casting.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll find many a story line featuring &quot;the wizened activist&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that&#39;s my proposed spectrum:&amp;nbsp; &quot;Curators&quot; (on the right) versus &quot;Experimentalists&quot; (on the left).&amp;nbsp; Or shall we say &quot;Base Campers&quot; versus &quot;Scouts&quot;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d say let me know what you think in the comments, however the model here is that of &quot;a Quaker journal&quot; and so no &quot;comments&quot; are expected.&amp;nbsp; However off site commentary is always welcome.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do Left and Right mean to you?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the axis I&#39;ve described make any sense as an organizing polarity?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2722956963527561657'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2722956963527561657'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/10/a-political-spectrum.html' title='A Political Spectrum'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1615106812507630239</id><published>2022-10-23T15:24:00.005-07:00</published><updated>2022-10-23T15:26:07.093-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Asylum City</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that elections are rolling around, there&#39;s a lot more focus on the fact that Portland (Oregon) is on the front lines when it comes to working with refugees and their plight as such.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business of an exclusionary economy is to create a throng of &quot;losers&quot; in its wake, but the inconvenient truth is we have sufficient know-how to deal with the problem more intelligently and with better planning.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That truth is inconvenient because now the old ways, involving morally righteous disposal, are ringing hollow.&amp;nbsp; Especially when these are your neighbors.&amp;nbsp; The attempt to turn this into a zombie apocalypse only works on the least thoughtful (the most in need of brains).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The link between refugee camps (caused by) and war programming (lethal theater) is pretty obvious.&amp;nbsp; A lot of vets end up refugee, in their own country, so-called.&amp;nbsp; They self medicate (use) and end up sick but without care.&amp;nbsp; Yet we&#39;re at that point in human evolution where we know better, so the religious (again, so-called) often sound cruel and hollow, even in their own ears sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fine tuning in and around Portland is something we&#39;re allowed to converse about in today&#39;s climate, given the sense there&#39;s almost no one in the political class up for thinking sufficiently like a social engineer (a term with a bad rep, even though social media jobs often involve quite a bit of engineering).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The race for the governor position is especially neck and neck and rhetoric about homelessness, the problem of, ring loudly in the halls of government, as transmitted by media.&amp;nbsp; Ecotourists come through doing &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/40a3-rDyH4U&quot;&gt;selfie-based travelogues&lt;/a&gt;, musing out loud about Portland the Laboratory (with its cast of human guinea pigs).&amp;nbsp; Isn&#39;t that really any city though?&amp;nbsp; Life is experimental in nature, especially in urban settings, but not only in those.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what the science says anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1615106812507630239'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1615106812507630239'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/10/asylum-city_23.html' title='Asylum City'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1108690793445939730</id><published>2022-10-09T12:44:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2022-10-09T12:44:53.503-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Retrospective: Occupy Portland (2011)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/dYNgDIR0pMM&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1108690793445939730'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1108690793445939730'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/10/retrospective-occupy-portland-2011.html' title='Retrospective: Occupy Portland (2011)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/dYNgDIR0pMM/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3897069915721381753</id><published>2022-10-02T12:41:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2022-10-02T12:46:13.985-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Weighing In Again</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t impute a lot of nefarious motives to Annoying Orange (a moniker, meme taken), without a much more persuasive case in that direction.&amp;nbsp; I never bought that dealings with the Ukraine election, on the part of Manafort et al, arose to the level of suspicion projected by armchair viewer voyeurs, the know-it-alls on the matter.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, I&#39;m biased to think he wanted a pile of souvenirs and interesting reading, not to mention decor, while his Maga Army brought him back, Napolean style, from his Corsica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annoying Orange had a dismissive, haughty attitude towards a lot of professionals, leaving a bitter taste and wish for revenge.&amp;nbsp; He treated his security clearances not as privileges but as rights, as president, to overstep his place and serve unconscionably as a crowd-pleaser in various taboo ways.&amp;nbsp; The sin of taking oneself too seriously is always hard to see through if one is lacking in self awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/08/city-of-morons.html&quot;&gt;my snobbishness towards DC&lt;/a&gt; in general, I&#39;m hardly the right person to ask, when it comes to doling out justice.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m a blogger, Quaker journaler, saying I&#39;m seeing Annoying Orange as closer to Dennis the Menace than some kind of evil operative.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s a Soprano at worst, and that&#39;s not even a show I&#39;ve watched much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3897069915721381753'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3897069915721381753'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/10/weighing-in-again.html' title='Weighing In Again'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/e-yvVVye0ds/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-5526051493648878723</id><published>2022-09-21T19:19:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2022-09-23T14:19:30.629-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Weighing In</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not one to frequently weigh in on &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2022/08/regarding-sideshow.html&quot;&gt;what everyone&#39;s talking&lt;/a&gt; about, nor pile on where others are piling.&amp;nbsp; That behavior is less out of snobbery, I would claim, than out of respect for those more into it than I am.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Let&#39;s not be redundant&quot; I tell myself.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d prefer to be effective, have some leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That being said, I think the former oval office guy is being consistent with his narrative the election was stolen.

I think more people would say I&#39;m part of a &quot;cult of personality&quot; in seeming to kiss the ground &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2022/09/statecraft-crafting-of-states.html&quot;&gt;my Buddha&lt;/a&gt; has walked upon, that Buddha being one Guinea Pig B.&amp;nbsp; In translation:&amp;nbsp; my narrative about impotus and the Grunch inherits from American literature penned by a Medal of Freedom winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. T&#39;s ego had utility as a driving engine and helped an audio-animatronic presidency seem more believable.&amp;nbsp; That same ego denied the validity of the electioneering behind 2020, but that&#39;s the only way voters know how to run an election.&amp;nbsp; Those who succumb too quickly to conspiracy theories (some of which will be true on occasion) got some therapy.&amp;nbsp; Too many conspiracy theories in thick succession (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2022/07/a-political-recap.html&quot;&gt;Venezuelan voting machines&lt;/a&gt;) tend to be self-canceling and self-undoing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the momentum of Mr. T. is underlining his ongoing unhappiness with the election results and his willingness to take active measures to defend his government in exile, in an alternative reality America that&#39;s being made great again (meaning it isn&#39;t great now -- a self-defeatist attitude, as many have pointed out).&amp;nbsp; Getting an audience whipped up enough to mount another attack will likely not work twice, given the evident weakness of the leadership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5526051493648878723'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5526051493648878723'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/09/weighing-in.html' title='Weighing In'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-6697764196471791327</id><published>2022-09-11T11:49:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2022-09-23T13:42:42.071-07:00</updated><title type='text'>M4W</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recall a new relative, from South Africa, kind of squirming at TG a few years ago, when I brought up &lt;i&gt;Die Antwoord&lt;/i&gt;, the music group.&amp;nbsp; Although self cast as a duo, the Ninja guy and Yolandi, the group has lots of off screen talent, visiting dancers and the rest.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/03/chappie-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;The movie &lt;i&gt;Chappie&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;...&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m a fan.&amp;nbsp; But in her circles, this showbiz act was an embarrassment, as maybe some UKers felt around &lt;i&gt;The Beatles&lt;/i&gt;, at least originally, back in the day.&amp;nbsp; This is what you admire in British culture?&amp;nbsp; What about our Victorian tea cups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s an odd segue to G &amp;amp; O I suppose:&amp;nbsp; Gurdjieff and Ouspensky.&amp;nbsp; These were not heroes in my youth, as I&#39;d barely heard of either.&amp;nbsp; I followed Freud, Ernest Becker, Norman O. Brown, Wittgenstein... that&#39;s up through university, when I jumped into Erhard &amp;amp; Fuller, a dynamic duo back then (&lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2022/08/new-bucky-bio.html&quot;&gt;see the new bio&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve continued to add to my graph (tree) of course.&amp;nbsp; We don&#39;t wanna be stuck in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m thinking politically in making Ouspensky a focus, in wanting to include some folks from St. Petersburg (I&#39;m talking Eurasia, not Florida), Moscow and like that, in the foyer of fecund philosophers.&amp;nbsp; Yes there&#39;s a &quot;self help&quot; angle to what they were doing.&amp;nbsp; So what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas psychoanalysts must needs be psychoanalyzed as a part of their training, we might be worried the philosophers have no therapy.&amp;nbsp; Enter Wittgenstein, with his philosophy a therapy for specific metaphysical pathologies he knew only too well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no crime in philosophy wanting to have workshops or seminars, meetups with exercises (rituals) or whatever.&amp;nbsp; The so-called church has no monopoly on soul searching and/or making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have other ulterior motives however.&amp;nbsp; Gurdjieff is someone Bucky jokingly found congenial, and a fellow alcohol user back then, or so Dr. Richard Buckminster Fuller &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/SynergeticsDictionary/SDCards.php?cn=7115&amp;amp;tp=2&quot;&gt;seemed to suggest&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; He talked about the interminable toasts to the many types of idiot, with each a raised glass of something.&amp;nbsp; Wine? Did the great master use colored water?&amp;nbsp; Random Google:&amp;nbsp; &lt;span&gt;&quot;Although &lt;i&gt;Gurdjieff did show some of the signs suggestive of alcoholism&lt;/i&gt;, such a daily drinking, drinking early in the day, and driving after drinking...&quot;. OK, I get it, he liked to drink.&amp;nbsp; Shades of Alan Watts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That brings us to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est:_The_Steersman_Handbook&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;EST:&amp;nbsp; The Steersmans&#39; Handbook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a copy of which I&#39;ve only recently (relatively) acquired and consumed.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s where Bucky is mentioned, and this was all pre &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erhard_Seminars_Training&quot;&gt;Erhard Seminars Training&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Then Bucky and &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; would cross paths (read &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2022/08/new-bucky-bio.html&quot;&gt;the new bio&lt;/a&gt; for more of the story).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;That&#39;s some pretty tight semantics, and summarizes our chapter:&amp;nbsp; man the machine (&quot;man cannot do&quot;), man the Spaceship Earth program (woman the &quot;womb man&quot; -- if that&#39;s the etymology).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;[ Using &quot;man&quot; or &quot;guy&quot; as a generic actually has a feminist dimension.&amp;nbsp; The words no longer work to discriminate or distinguish.&amp;nbsp; The default could just as well be female, in our 300 man brigade, task force or group. ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Is my point that &quot;overcomers&quot; (as in &quot;we shall overcome&quot;) might be drinkers?&amp;nbsp; More to the point is the similarity across these self help systems:&amp;nbsp; how to address one&#39;s robotic behavior, complete with habits one sometimes feels at a loss to control.&amp;nbsp; Some philosophers look down on philosophies with much of a psychological dimension, especially where self improvement is involved, and use lots of pejorative language (negative adverts, attack modes), versus jumping into the fray as honest competitors (self promoting, proving positive worth).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In other words, both Bucky and G&amp;amp;O accentuated the positive, and we see that in their respective trackers and backers quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I&#39;ll fade to &lt;i&gt;Medium&lt;/i&gt; here, quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://kirbyurner.medium.com/est-the-steersman-handbook-1c755d25c1db&quot;&gt;one of my stories&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;pw-post-body-paragraph kq kr jb ks b kt ku kc kv kw kx kf ky kz la lb lc ld le lf lg lh li lj lk ll if gh&quot; data-selectable-paragraph=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;3c46&quot;&gt;EST

 Fuller is a “simulsense man in spite of his advanced years” (page 34) 
and Bucky blurbs about the book excitedly on the front cover (see

 and paves the future for the “chummy” relationship achieved by Erhard

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Middle Americas  &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you&#39;re curious what social engineering might look like, let me share some science fiction.&amp;nbsp; For one thing, I come from the viewpoint of the Americas all being delighted with one another.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That North Americans have a Mexico to enjoy, and vice versa, is a double blessing.&amp;nbsp; So many North Americans I know, and not just the so-called Hispanic ones, are in love with Mexican culture, whereas others have retired in Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Belize, Panama and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to tell EJA I was bound for Costa Rica, just to get away from the oppressive MIC, which is AFSC jargon for &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; (to which I give a Jungian spin, i.e. &quot;complex&quot; is a psyche thing). My sister lived there for some years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of teaching, I want to introduce high schoolers to Regexes, and not just inside the domain of &quot;computer science&quot;.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re always reminded that Regular Expressions were invented by a mathematician. Lets expand high school math to include them.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s on my plate for the next couple days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the social engineering centers around weather reports, as broadcast over TV stations.&amp;nbsp; Some of the GPS / GIS maps in the background are fairly TexMex in their makeup, i.e. we&#39;re in some Middle America between Mexico City and Las Vegas.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a road net, a set of mountain ranges, some valleys with rivers.&amp;nbsp; The Colorado, for example, no longer has much of a delta to speak of.&amp;nbsp; Humans have diverted 100% of that particular river.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m getting off topic w/r to TV weather, but not w/r to global climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TV viewer-voyeurs are as familiar with Middle Americas as with so-called New England, they&#39;ll be less prone to fuel the polarizing language factions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the Americas are in love with themselves.&amp;nbsp; We have so much to treasure.&amp;nbsp; We are the real West after all (plenty wild), not the pseudo-west of the Atlantic-bounded EU East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather maps, as you&#39;ve noticed, are used to promote a sense of cohesion, of us versus them. That&#39;s why you still see these ludicrous masking algorithms, wherein the &quot;weather of interest&quot; is miraculously masked out.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As if political boundaries trumped nature.&amp;nbsp; Hilarious right?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We get more serious around airports, acknowledging there&#39;s an ecosphere (aka a biosphere).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, though, we&#39;re living (mentally) in a house divided, some us versus them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s your model?&amp;nbsp; Question authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture a weather map that strays from Oregon to Washington to Vancouver without a pause.&amp;nbsp; Bellingham is the belly button of this Cascadia place.&amp;nbsp; Do we need permission from the District to frame our weather reports as such?&amp;nbsp; Of course not.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We might obey conventions out of reflex of course.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Lets do what we&#39;ve always done!&quot; is the slogan of Darwin Award champions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4639753168404968040'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4639753168404968040'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/08/social-engineering.html' title='Social Engineering'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3329603302410163603</id><published>2022-08-11T14:12:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2022-11-04T11:59:31.787-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Supergrids</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/DN1mPBQd7fY&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve noticed for awhile now that the idea of a
&quot;global grid&quot; is nowadays said to be an Asian
and, more specifically, a Chinese idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not mentioned here in this Bloomberg vid, is
Bucky&#39;s World Game making the global grid
a top priority.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I guess Bucky is just too scary and troubling a
figure to bring up casually in corporate business
circles.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The vid also fails to mention one of the oldest
HVDC lines, from Oregon to California.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3329603302410163603'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3329603302410163603'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/08/supergrids.html' title='Supergrids'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/DN1mPBQd7fY/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4983768428544498345</id><published>2022-08-01T14:25:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2022-08-10T10:51:19.506-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Mind vs Brain</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;What I&#39;m not expecting the new biography of Bucky Fuller to dive into, given time and space constraints, is Fuller&#39;s relationship with P.

pioneering ideas was also influenced by mystically oriented teachers 
whom he met in New York City at the beginning of the Great Depression. 
He gravitated to esoteric teachings in spiritual development by the 
Russian mystic George Ivanovich Gurdjieff (whom Fuller met in Greenwich 
Village in the late 1920s) and his pupils P. D. Ouspensky and Claude 
Bragdon, and, in the 1930s, the controversial French American scientist 
Alexis Carrel. Drawing on these various sources, Fuller merged the 
design conceptions of his single-family house with mystical iterations 
on self-propelled evolution. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/minnesota-scholarship-online/book/15100/chapter-abstract/&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection I&#39;m seeing is between Gurdjieff&#39;s picture of &quot;man, a machine&quot;, striving to awaken, and Fuller&#39;s own emphasis on automaticity, i.e. on processes not carried out consciously, such as digesting and growing hair... including consciousness itself?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&#39;t know how we do it.&amp;nbsp; Look ma, no hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our automaticity is not something we need to moralize about or feel guilty about, so much as wake up to. Like they said in &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt;:&amp;nbsp; guilt is that thing you hold on to so you can keep doing that thing you feel guilty about.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per Bucky, and just ordinary language, waking up to inappropriate reflexes is more a matter of correcting for awkwardness, once a habit gets way out of whack vs-a-vs the actual challenges.&amp;nbsp; But doesn&#39;t this beg the question as to what&#39;s inappropriate?&amp;nbsp; Who&#39;s to judge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a page from Krishnamurti, is it a matter of seeing the cost?&amp;nbsp; Or call it sticker shock.&amp;nbsp; We snap out of it to the extent we catch ourselves falling into it, whatever that is.&amp;nbsp; The shock of realizing you about to doze off in the driver&#39;s seat is what might finally persuade you to pull off, the better practice in these conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming &quot;the Self&quot; in the Jungian sense is an anchoring equilibrium, then a disequilibrium might be a daydream or system, a set of beliefs, a faith and practice.&amp;nbsp; We accept an aberrational system, always needing Self correction in principle.&amp;nbsp; But what shocks us into actually shaking off the old habits to make room for new grooming?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bring &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; into it because in retrospect it doesn&#39;t surprise me that these two philosophers would precessionally orbit one another, but not necessarily converge.&amp;nbsp; Fuller never did the &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; Training.&amp;nbsp; Yet his and Erhard&#39;s karma most definitely intertwined.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m pointing to a common lineage:&amp;nbsp; &quot;esoteric&quot; teachings that begin with the unconscious and/or sleeping and/or habitual nature of the human psyche (including thought), with respect to a possibly unrealized self awareness potential.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put &quot;esoteric&quot; in scare quotes because none of the actors mentioned was actively working to make their teachings private and/or secret.&amp;nbsp; What makes the teachings &quot;hidden&quot; is the need to work on oneself, which can be difficult and may imply a workshop setting, with exercises and self-disciplines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Applewhite mentions in &lt;i&gt;Cosmic Fishing&lt;/i&gt; somewhere, Fuller was not prone to demonize.&amp;nbsp; He was not into pointing the finger of blame or indulging in resentment, the paradigm negative emotion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could see what he was up against, in terms of pattern integrities.&amp;nbsp; Yet he is adamant about having no goodies or baddies at the heart of his mechanics.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s taking after Nietzsche in that way, in revaluing all values. &quot;Accentuate the positive&quot; was his motto, from that song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Man cannot do, because man is a bureaucracy&quot; might be one way to provide a synopsis of the Fourth Way teachings.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To will the good is to will one thing, according to Kierkegaard.&amp;nbsp; But how often are we free of ambivalence?&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t we fragment into numerous &quot;I&quot; types, each with a point of view?&amp;nbsp; We fight with ourselves, in a battle of self overcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fuller wanted to accommodate the namespaces he trusted, even where the shop talks diverged.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d have his own way to keep Love and Gravity connected, including through ample discussion of Newton&#39;s Law.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s that one-on-one love, of two black holes, swirling around one another, one day to converge.&amp;nbsp; Then there&#39;s that peeling off from a 90 degree orbit and making one&#39;s own way, neither tugging nor resisting, what Fuller labeled &quot;precession&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Fuller&#39;s shoptalk, the &quot;brain bureaucracy&quot; may be semi-paralyzed in an awkward state, looking to pull out of a tailspin.&amp;nbsp; The mind is able to reshape the aberrational, provided one stays open to it.&amp;nbsp; Whether it&#39;s able to do so in time is touch and go in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;

The vista may contain a lot of roiling and boiling, a lot of dynamism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sometimes gets difficult in these multi-player games is figuring out what teams are really fighting what other teams, versus putting on a show.&amp;nbsp; Team A perhaps makes a big show of fighting Team B, in order to deceive Team C, whereas in actual fact, A and B are on a meta team together, and their seeming opposition is more about outing their adversaries in the C group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like if Bob is actually in cahoots with Alice, yet they portray themselves as opposite poles, then if Eve goes to Bob to betray Alice, Bob might tell Alice.&amp;nbsp; Eve is caught in the middle with nowhere to go, but may not realize it.&amp;nbsp; She may believe she can play one side against the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matter of secret understandings and hidden alliances is often a source of paranoia.&amp;nbsp; The computations get too intricate and a player may blow a fuse.&amp;nbsp; Conspiracy theories break out at this point, widely shared or closely guarded.&amp;nbsp; If the theory is testable, then it may not be crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These same dynamics play out on soap operas, in families.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes a public stance of neutrality, broadcast to all players, is a best way to stay sane, with backdoor attempts to undermine neutrality thereby countered.&amp;nbsp; Public declarations of transparency open a space for whistle blowers and ongoing revelations.&amp;nbsp; Exposing truth is more a process more than an end state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Am I planning to map all this theory to any specific situation on the ground?&amp;nbsp; Not at this point.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m just looking for patterns.&amp;nbsp; In my minds eye, I&#39;m flitting between situations, some geopolitical, all psychological.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acts of kindness, without strings attached, no quid pro quo, sometimes come across as confidence building measures.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Team A wants to reassure Team C that their stance is not adversarial.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s all find and good and yet who speaks for the team?&amp;nbsp; Does it have the one captain?&amp;nbsp; Does it speak with one voice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, the big unknown in these equations is the level of trust.&amp;nbsp; What has an agent (acting party) come to conclude regarding the predictability and consistency, of either an adversary or friend?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether to consider another team adversarial or friendly may come down to decisions based on history, track record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5839054130615848244'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5839054130615848244'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/07/game-theory.html' title='Game Theory'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3144103375956611879</id><published>2022-07-22T08:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2022-07-22T20:16:48.554-07:00</updated><title type='text'>World Game Museum (WGM)</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve toured a lot of propaganda museums in my day.&amp;nbsp; We lived in Europe and every chance we got (&quot;we&quot; = my nuclear family), we&#39;d load the car, including the car&#39;s rooftop with a family-sized tent (German made), and off we&#39;d go.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trip took us across the Adriatic by car ferry from Italy to Greece, I&#39;m guessing that was also the Turkey trip, thence to Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary... probably Prague that time too.&amp;nbsp; You get the idea.&amp;nbsp; Along the way, we&#39;d visit museums.&amp;nbsp; Some were about defunct ideologies, and the social engineering that kept them going in their day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such educational touring is itself a world game activity, or call it playing, versus warring.&amp;nbsp; Warring is deadly serious whereas playing contains a lot of lightness.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the gray zone in between, war involves playing with war toys in a simulation (training, playing a game), knowing one is bound for a theater.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a whole curriculum about making you a hero.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what a War Game Museum might curate:&amp;nbsp; the many brands of toy soldier they would factory-make or hand-craft, for the benefit (&quot;&quot;) of little children (scare quotes on the side in case any become pawns in someone else&#39;s game).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember a page from TV and movie star Adam West&#39;s auto-bio, cited in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/w-eG4qQMJks&quot;&gt;a documentary film&lt;/a&gt;, in which he&#39;s being shot from a cannon, in the circus, in his batman suit, when he realizes his whole shtick is self demeaning. He&#39;s allowing his fate to be determined in too passive a tense. He resolves to &quot;play a different character&quot; so to speak.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An awakening sometimes happens when children find themselves scripted into someone else&#39;s fantasy, forced to play along.&amp;nbsp; They may not have had that perspective at first, initially imagining themselves a co-author, or peer screen writer.&amp;nbsp; To retain integrity and self respect, they maybe have to drop out or peel off.&amp;nbsp; Such is their transition to adulthood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the transition from war game &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2022/07/regarding-world-game.html&quot;&gt;to world game&lt;/a&gt; may involve escaping serious child abuse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you discover you&#39;re just a guinea pig in some weapons factory&#39;s field testing experiment, in a scenario wherein the factory managers and investors become your commanders through rotation, then you might start looking for an escape route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An underground railroad usually develops in response to any serious master-slave situation, to help funnel said slaves to freedom while frustrating master power grabs.&amp;nbsp; The WGM will help memorialize some of these railroads, as a source of new recruits (ex slaves).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighting for freedom is not necessarily a weaponry game, as Muhammad Ali could tell you (along with MLK).&amp;nbsp; Livingry plays a role too, especially psychologically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major General Smedley D. Butler had the courage of his convictions when he penned &lt;i&gt;War is a Racket&lt;/i&gt;, more a pamphlet than a book, and a message to future generations.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had served in the American-Philippine war, prototypical of the war in Vietnam in testing the readiness of the home folks for Empire. The Anti-imperialist League (Mark Twain &amp;amp; Co.) signaled the home folks weren&#39;t ready (and never would be) but signals can be ignored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The empire-minded had a New American Century (the 1900s) in their sights, even before any plans for a next Reich in Europe.&amp;nbsp; The UK had set the bar, with a first globe-spanning example.&amp;nbsp; Some thought the USA was destined to inherit the UK&#39;s mantle.&amp;nbsp; Others thought said mantle smelled a lot like a dead albatross.&amp;nbsp; The Revolutionary War had been about escaping, not fostering, an imperial mindset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3144103375956611879'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3144103375956611879'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/07/world-game-museum-wgm.html' title='World Game Museum (WGM)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1597355945371399230</id><published>2022-07-12T10:57:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2022-07-12T11:02:16.971-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Theme Park USA</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

Wood&lt;/a&gt; of dubious engineering credentials (at first) for being a great social engineer when it came to selling the theme park idea, which I am personally enamored of to this day.&amp;nbsp; Dark rides, as well as real train rides, and later roller coasters, have been deeply influential on my own psyche.&amp;nbsp; Like I can relate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The CIA of Ralph McGehee and Ray McGovern wasn&#39;t going anywhere either.&amp;nbsp; You could see George Tenet taking on Richard Perle in the opening paragraphs of his memoir, &lt;i&gt;At the Center of the Storm&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, the agency was spreading out away from the District as long ago as during Casey&#39;s tenure.&amp;nbsp; This was not really a new development however, as the whole point of the agency was to be a global network, self informing.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In terms of employment, insisting on narrow specialization in weapons training is an anathema, the opposite of diversified growth, more of what brought the USA to the brink of extinction (some would say that brink has been crossed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syria is a good example.&amp;nbsp; After years of civil war, there&#39;s been some chance to rebuild in Aleppo.&amp;nbsp; Not every apartment building has to be restored.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the better plan is to finish the demolition, level, and build atop the rubble of what came before.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s if the new building techniques are any better.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps people would prefer a Nomadland, featuring semi-mobile vehicles they could live in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oregonians have connections to Ukraine and have no reason to withhold from speculation, when it comes to plans to rebuild.&amp;nbsp; A demilitarized Ukraine could be just as prosperous, with tourism permitted from all corners.&amp;nbsp; Ecotourists especially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course the big money showcased as passing through Congress, a choreographed maneuver, presupposes this funding is spoken for, and is designed to enter the coffers of NATO&#39;s vendors, to pay for new inventory, under the command of their socialized military personnel.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine does not have a say in NATO currently, but as the recipient of so much largess, is cast as forever grateful.&amp;nbsp; Without &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2023/07/pacific-rim-radar.html&quot;&gt;NATO&lt;/a&gt;, where would Ukraine be today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian side is already starting to rebuild, as winning over a new citizenry implies a trajectory back to civilian normalcy. The best PR is to begin repairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia does not need the EU to crumble, as basket case neighbors are prone to poor judgement.&amp;nbsp; Their &quot;nothing to lose&quot; mentality gets the better of them.&amp;nbsp; Extremists exploit extreme conditions.&amp;nbsp; Who wants to deal with freezing Germans?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/1XsZA5OXFaE&quot;&gt;NS2&lt;/a&gt; could be turned on tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; Of course DC would object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The challenge has been the challenge of brain surgery:&amp;nbsp; how to address the issue without killing the patient.&amp;nbsp; In being a huge part of Europe, Russia has been operating on itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding Ukraine might not be a high priority for every developer though.&amp;nbsp; Many on the sidelines, in a cheerleading capacity, are convinced they&#39;re in a position to extract their pound of flesh.&amp;nbsp; Their desire for vengeance is high.&amp;nbsp; Civilians getting on with their lives takes a back seat.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the plan is to keep them as displaced refugees and stoke their resentment?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allowing Ukraine to carry on without being remotely controllable from Washington DC, goes against what many a control freak requires, to feel secure.&amp;nbsp; If they don&#39;t feel secure, then it&#39;s their business to make sure none of us do.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stopping the rebuilding of a civilian Ukraine, in favor of more combat and degradation, could be what some of the limited liability boards have in store for us.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re maybe not in the rebuilding business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is whether the large bureaucracies will follow them, or expel them, as no longer representing the more profitable way forward.&amp;nbsp; Helping refugees, while rebuilding a humane habitat is potentially one of the biggest businesses of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3113134352851203958'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3113134352851203958'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2022/07/rebuilding-ukraine.html' title='Rebuilding Ukraine'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
