&lt;br /&gt;
US presidents tend to gauge their own power in terms of their ability to force &quot;regime change&quot; in other parts of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The overthrow of &lt;span class=&quot;st&quot;&gt;Mosaddegh in the Eisenhower years &lt;/span&gt;and the re-installation of the puppet Shah of Iran gave Allen Dulles and cronies a sense of what&#39;s possible.  Guatemala then too, with Chile to come later, under Nixon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cuba was a more intractable &quot;problem&quot; as we see in hindsight, and now also Syria.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The White House has already been used as a platform to insist &quot;Assad must go&quot; with little thought about the day after.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
President Obama admits his most serious mistake might have been not thinking about &quot;the day after&quot; in Libya, where a similar &quot;must go&quot; posture was struck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A major symptom of a government imagining itself to be a &quot;superpower&quot; (i.e. having superpowers) is this insistence on having both the right and the wherewithal to overturn (&quot;topple&quot;) other governments. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keeping the people in line and in favor of &quot;regime change&quot; likewise requires endless bombardment with propaganda.&amp;nbsp; Minions need to be perpetually persuaded they&#39;re following the right leaders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Assad uses barrel bombs&quot;; so did the Pentagon, in great quantities, during Vietnam, they&#39;re less expensive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Assad gassed his own people&quot;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://americanfreepress.net/seymour-hersh-assad-innocent&quot;&gt;the evidence suggests&lt;/a&gt; that famous sarin attack in Ghouta was engineered by Assad&#39;s enemies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes the &quot;civil war&quot; in Syria is ugly.&amp;nbsp; So was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/11/made-in-usa.html&quot;&gt;civil war in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Adding cruise missiles and stealth bombers to the equation has so far not helped any.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any except the weapons testers that is, who are having a field day with their criminal undeclared war on civilian guinea pigs, the pattern since WW1, and outlawed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/11/armistice-day-2016.html&quot;&gt;the Kellogg-Briand Pact&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Saddam Hussein has a nuclear weapons program&quot;; the allegations are designed to create fear in the general population and therefore support for more military action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Or is popular support even a requirement anymore?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Opposition to the war against Iraq was huge, yet the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/08/city-of-morons.html&quot;&gt;WDC government&lt;/a&gt; went ahead anyway, bringing narratives about &quot;democracy&quot; to the brink of bankruptcy.&amp;nbsp; Are we back to monarchy then, or is it oligarchy?&amp;nbsp; Welcome to the Banana Republic of North America (BRNA).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does there ever come a point when a population develops antibodies to all this fear and manipulation by those suffering from a &quot;superpower&quot; military-industrial complex?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do we have any kind of antidote for this Fourth Reich mental illness?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As a footnote to the above interview&lt;/i&gt;:&amp;nbsp; my understanding is General Krulack&#39;s office in the Pentagon had arranged for Diem&#39;s transport to Europe but Diem was not yet ready to admit defeat and balked (sources: L. Fletcher Prouty, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/prouty4.txt&quot;&gt;admittedly controversial&lt;/a&gt;; corroborating sources: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.liquisearch.com/arrest_and_assassination_of_ngo_dinh_diem/intended_arrest_at_gia_long_palace&quot;&gt;intended arrest&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB101/vn24.pdf&quot;&gt;CIA memo&lt;/a&gt;). The Kennedy brothers hoped he&#39;d get out alive, understanding their position was high risk.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long time readers of my blogs will maybe have seen how I bring up &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/u2.html&quot;&gt;the &quot;U2 incident&quot;&lt;/a&gt; from time to time.  This is another one of those times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David Talbot cites L. Fletcher Prouty, or &quot;Man X&quot; — played by Donald Sutherland in Oliver Stone&#39;s &lt;i&gt;JFK&lt;/i&gt; — as especially knowledgeable about the U2 incident.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However David sticks with the conventional narrative, that missiles hit this supersonic spy plane at high altitude, whereas Prouty himself calls that story line &lt;a href=&quot;https://politicalassassinations.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/cia-documents-show-us-never-believed-gary-powers-was-shot-down/&quot;&gt;into question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prouty sounds a lot like a prototypical &quot;9-11 truther&quot; in calling the basic physics into question, wondering aloud in several passages, how Gary Powers could have survived.&amp;nbsp; Did he eject before the missiles hit?&amp;nbsp; Why did he have all that incriminating ID on him?&amp;nbsp; Might he have simply landed the plane instead?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The operation certainly cost Allen Dulles some respect and judging from Prouty, that may have been a principal aim. Not everyone was suffering from blind hatred for Communist Russia, certainly not Lee Harvey Oswald, who&#39;d also worked in the U2 program in Japan. A smart Marine, he was curious about what life might be like in the USSR.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Allen had only partial or limited control over operations but had promised the moon, having seen regime change in Iran as proof of his superpowers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The former OSS was never altogether sold on the idea of dominoes in Vietnam either, witness &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/01/spiralling-onward.html&quot;&gt;Daniel Ellsberg of RAND&lt;/a&gt;, a strong patriot who simply didn&#39;t buy the old guard&#39;s fading worldview.&amp;nbsp; Ditto Ralph McGeehee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trying to bully or intimidate these people, already skilled, doesn&#39;t always produce the intended results.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eisenhower was under a lot of pressure after WWII to use the &quot;nuclear advantage&quot; for something meaningful.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;The Devil&#39;s Chessboard&lt;/i&gt; chronicles how irresponsibly John Foster Dulles, as Secretary of State, blundered about on the world stage, confusing Tunisia with Indonesia while threatening everyone with nukes.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
The theory or model put forward by the Armistice Day speakers today is pretty well spelled out in &lt;i&gt;Addicted to War&lt;/i&gt;, a tome mom likes to distribute, used in some schools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html&quot;&gt;Outward war is obsolete&lt;/a&gt; given our present day technology, however many industrialists depend on heavy war spending to stay in business and adjudge the victims of war expendable collateral.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Madeline Albright is &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/11/identity-politics.html&quot;&gt;one of the champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &quot;expendable collateral&quot; view, having famously expressed her opinion that the mounting death toll in Mesopotamia had been &quot;worth it&quot; in terms of her own bottom line.&amp;nbsp; Whether infant mortality rates were really as high as she was told is &lt;a href=&quot;https://psmag.com/the-iraq-sanctions-myth-5b05f6712df5#.ceyub3ufp&quot;&gt;a separate question&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Weapons systems need to be tested, and sometimes there&#39;s just no good substitute for real human subjects. Panama provided tests for the Apache helicopter.&amp;nbsp; Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan have become a playground for those who murder by bomb, drone and cruise missile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of our speakers &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/07/einstein-omsi.html&quot;&gt;invoked Einstein&lt;/a&gt;, known for his anti-nationalism.&amp;nbsp; Albert was asked to be Israel&#39;s first president however he wisely saw this as a trap in terms of his own personal integrity, even if his vanity was given a boost by the invite.&amp;nbsp; Besides, what would a theoretical physicist know about governing a country?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of WWI, people were sick of war and agreed to end them. The Kellog-Briand Pact, ratified by the US, became the law of the land, as well as a basis for the Nuremberg Trials and the UN itself.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kellogg%E2%80%93Briand_Pact&quot;&gt;Quoting from Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
As a practical matter, the Kellogg–Briand Pact did not live up to its
 aim of ending war, and in this sense it made no immediate contribution 
to international peace and proved to be ineffective in the years to 
come. Moreover, the pact erased the legal distinction between war and 
peace because the signatories, having renounced the use of war, began to
 wage wars without declaring them...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
True enough, but why blame the treaty?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The signatories, in refusing to declare wars while continuing to engage in them, merely exhibited their lack of moral fiber.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not the fault of the treaty that its signatories are so inept and lacking in integrity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Power of Nightmares&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a fine documentary in charting how wars could be kindled based on tensions between cultures. Politicians, as well as journalists, have learned that getting wars going may be a part of their job description, if they want continuing support from the munitions makers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether a war is illegal or not is secondary to its ability to serve certain economic interests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Smedley Butler, a decorated US soldier who defended FDR against the Business Plot, expressed his disgust with what I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html&quot;&gt;Cowardly Capitalism&lt;/a&gt; in his short essay &lt;i&gt;War is a Racket&lt;/i&gt;, oft quoted by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/10/opdx-pdv.html&quot;&gt;denizens of OPDX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
We&#39;re convened at the Linus Pauling house. I came in late and found the discussion was about municipal restrooms, public infrastructure, its state in our city. &amp;nbsp;That was something we looked at during OPDX as well, an ongoing issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn bravely agreed to do a presentation, the morning after election night. &amp;nbsp;I expect we would have rehashed the electoral results had we not preprogrammed the discussion. &amp;nbsp;Glenn had a bag of books he&#39;s been reading and did a &quot;reading rainbow&quot; kind of thing. &amp;nbsp;The focus was public policy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re also talking about drugs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/drug-pushers.html&quot;&gt;drug pushing&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The legals don&#39;t call their hype or advertising &quot;pushing,&quot; a term used to differentiate themselves from the black or grey market competition, which they marginalize through criminalization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of which, Proposition 64 passed in California.&amp;nbsp; Law enforcement doesn&#39;t see criminalization i.e. locking people up, as having anything to do with public health, because of course punishment for crimes is unrelated to providing remedies for social ills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The military is a big user of drugs as well, with government approval and encouragement, also as a source of funds for &quot;black ops&quot; (unaccounted for, off the books). &lt;i&gt;Warlords &amp;amp; Ganglands&lt;/i&gt; is a hot seller game in supermarkets this Christmas.&amp;nbsp; No wait, I made that up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn&#39;s commentary is somewhat along the lines of Michael Moore&#39;s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/10/where-to-invade-next-movie-review_66.html&quot;&gt;Where To Invade Next?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in that he&#39;s circling relatively more enlightened approaches in other countries that it might pay to adopt, Finland&#39;s in particular. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Direct A-to-B action, which always looks so rational and right, turns to unobtainium rather often, doesn&#39;t it? &quot;Precession&quot; is not big in most vocabularies (not even in my spellchecker -- now it is), along with &quot;deliberately non-straight lines&quot; -- two Buckyisms we pick up reading &lt;i&gt;Synergetics &lt;/i&gt;(not a popularization of anything, so not really that popular).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The psychological commentaries &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/10/ethnic-schools.html&quot;&gt;by Maurice Nicoll&lt;/a&gt; seem pretty clear on a &quot;second force&quot; which is not equal and opposite (as then nothing would happen) but almost, with a resultant payoff or outcome. The payoff may not be what one expected though -- alluding to last night&#39;s election. &amp;nbsp;Nature tends to be surprising, the future unpredictable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nicoll&#39;s system is psychological though, not counter-posed to Newton&#39;s laws.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt; actually paints action - reaction - resultant vectors into its low level event physics, somewhat a break with the past, and therefore more of an uphill project.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, something to think about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was thinking of heading to &lt;i&gt;Th&#39;underground&lt;/i&gt; today.&amp;nbsp; Measure 97 went down to defeat, despite our best efforts, but I haven&#39;t given up on #CodeCastle, a project relating to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/07/measure-97.html&quot;&gt;teacher training&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; However Wednesdays feature a special schedule with shortened hours as I recall, given the space doubles as a food distribution site. &lt;i&gt;Th&#39;underground&lt;/i&gt; is a coffee shop in the #CodeCastle basement.&lt;br /&gt;

A next medium project I need to take up, but I&#39;m not sure in what medium (so many media to choose from) will be directed towards Philosophy Space (also known as &quot;Philosophy World&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ludwig Wittgenstein&#39;s Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics (RFM) are annoying to many practicing mathematicians, because the tenor of his remarks do not reflect how they tend look at &quot;foundations&quot;. Ludwig seems to turn them to slurry in some cases, undermining their eternal validity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Similar annoyance is expressed towards another rank outsider &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/10/necessary-ruin-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;businessman industrialist&lt;/a&gt; of the 20th Century, the guy who helped bring us the DEW line (see &lt;i&gt;Cold War relics&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;nbsp; He purported to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/09/manga-on-mul.html&quot;&gt;novel way of modeling multiplication&lt;/a&gt; in higher dimensions (like &amp;gt; 0).&amp;nbsp; What does that even mean?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those who&#39;ve familiarized themselves with LW&#39;s writings (sorry, I&#39;m fine with initials, no hagiography need apply), come to see he&#39;s got some good points, worth sharing.&amp;nbsp; These days I&#39;m coming to learn how much he mined the William James corpus for good examples of a philosopher really doing some thinking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likewise, the &quot;Bucky stuff&quot; is not just fluff, as the tetrahedron is indeed a topological simplex, so trying it on for size as a volume unit is hardly a radical idea in the rear view mirror.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s radical is a vista wherein so few have thought to try said experiment, but then who&#39;s had the time or the inclination?&amp;nbsp; Now we&#39;ve got it, and can kick it around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Piling on these two annoyances, Wittgenstein&#39;s remarks and Fuller&#39;s fork in geometry, come the makers of &quot;caltrop math&quot; (non-violent despite associations twixt caltrops and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caltrop&quot;&gt;acts of war&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; The XYZ coordinate system has a new buddy, not saying I know the gender (of either really).&amp;nbsp; The IVM made by Bucky easily accommodates said &quot;quadray coordinates&quot; (pioneered after &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt; was published).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stay tuned as to medium.&amp;nbsp; In just getting this outline out there, I&#39;m hoping to spark some more interest in the background materials.&amp;nbsp; Check &lt;i&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/i&gt; and like that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Think of it this way:&amp;nbsp; what would it be like to inject Quadray coordinates into Wittgenstein&#39;s remarks? The Bucky stuff is certainly like a Renaissance Neoplatonism.&amp;nbsp; These are science fiction moves, contrary to historical fact, designed to kindle new fires in some imaginations.&amp;nbsp; Not everyone is into philosophy obviously.&amp;nbsp; A positive outcome I would expect is a growing familiarity with some innovative ideas with practical applications.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I enjoyed a productive meetup with Nathaniel Bobbit at &lt;i&gt;The Bagdad&lt;/i&gt; last night.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s widely read, and in more than one language, having studied Heidegger in Spanish, Husserl too maybe.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d been married to a Spanish non-English speaker at one point.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s looking at tackling Russian these days, an admirable challenge for a man in his early sixties (we&#39;re close to the same age, as I&#39;m in my late fifties).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We talked about whether Bucky Fuller could be categorized as a &quot;transcendentalist&quot; or not.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism&quot;&gt;common wisdom&lt;/a&gt; is that school of thought was tied off a long time ago, to be succeeded by &quot;pragmatism&quot;.&amp;nbsp; He clued me about &lt;i&gt;The Metaphysical Club&lt;/i&gt;, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28202.The_Metaphysical_Club&quot;&gt;Pulitzer Prize winning book&lt;/a&gt; on the latter, by Louis Menand which I can get for my Kindle for under $10.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, it&#39;s hard to get Fuller squeezed into any camp of philosopher, despite his mind-brain distinction and frequent used of &quot;metaphysical&quot; within his corpus, I think largely because he patented and built artifacts. Philosophers don&#39;t putter about with cars or domes, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nat hadn&#39;t known about Fuller&#39;s meetup with Ezra Pound towards the end of the latter&#39;s long life, when he&#39;d mostly given up making public appearances and was living in Italy.&amp;nbsp; Ezra first met Fuller in Spoleto and then attended his talks near Venice.&amp;nbsp; Some of these details appear in &lt;i&gt;The Pound Era&lt;/i&gt; by Hugh Kenner, and in &lt;i&gt;Humans in Universe&lt;/i&gt; by Anwar Dil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bobbit also clued me about the work of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Hanks&quot;&gt;Patrick Hanks&lt;/a&gt; in corpus pattern analysis, wherein one uses computers to tease out how words are actually being used (usage patterns).&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/ppug-2009113.html&quot;&gt;I recall a talk&lt;/a&gt; on Python&#39;s being used for that.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/06/aristotle-was-right.html&quot;&gt;semantic web&lt;/a&gt;&quot; was a different, though I&#39;d argue related project.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hadn&#39;t known of Edgar Allan Poe&#39;s invective against the transcendentalists of his day and understand how that&#39;d lead to raised eyebrows around his &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka:_A_Prose_Poem&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Eureka: A Prose Poem&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — was he being satirical?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m guessing it was more a case of feeling he could do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html&quot;&gt;E.J. Applewhite&lt;/a&gt; saw it as in the same ballpark as Fuller&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt; in two volumes (Macmillan) which had also threatened to become a prose poem if not properly shepherded.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/necker-cube-guy.html&quot;&gt;Applewhite&lt;/a&gt; also compiled the four volume &lt;i&gt;Synergetics Dictionary&lt;/i&gt;, a kind of corpus pattern analysis vis-&lt;span data-dobid=&quot;hdw&quot;&gt;à&lt;/span&gt;-vis the Fuller namespace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of Python, I met someone at the Quaker meetinghouse who uses the teaching of science to teach English as a Second Language (ESL), and I asked her if computer programming were ever used in that way.&amp;nbsp; Object oriented thinking requires a kind of generic precision, a kind of grammar, based around the new punctuation of &quot;dot notation&quot;.&amp;nbsp; We have these noun.verb() and noun.adjective forms, where nouns will have types, even ancestries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ESL students tend to like the level playing field aspect, of all learning something new together.&amp;nbsp; The namespace keeps the English from wandering off into a tangle.&amp;nbsp; We have our attributes, properties, behavior, inner state.&amp;nbsp; We even have a &#39;self&#39; in Python.&amp;nbsp; Of course other languages besides English could piggy-back on computer science, as a way to introduce themselves coherently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I clued Nat about the &lt;i&gt;Bubbles&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Globes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Foam&lt;/i&gt; volumes, relatively new in English (translated from German).&amp;nbsp; Fuller is in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sloterdijk&quot;&gt;proper names&lt;/a&gt; index.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
How one deploys an identity makes a difference.&amp;nbsp; In identifying &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/10/some-quaker-overview.html&quot;&gt;as Quaker&lt;/a&gt;, I go back to when Philadelphian Friends were somewhat upbeat about a utopia to come.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-quaker-arc.html&quot;&gt;heady 1790s&lt;/a&gt;, some of the avatars of industrialization actually thought they could see light at the end of the tunnel, a way out of some Dickensian hell based in class warfare or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A company town really could be idyllic, not some battle ground twixt management and emergent unions.&amp;nbsp; Or maybe it&#39;s not a &quot;company town&quot; just a town where companies and its universities share a lot of values and resources.&amp;nbsp; They wouldn&#39;t be &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/major-barbara-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;munitions makers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fast forward, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://wwionline.org/articles/quaker-civilian-war-relief-great-war-and-its-aftermath-1914-1922/&quot;&gt;the Quakers&#39; AFSC&lt;/a&gt;, like President Hoover (a Quaker), was resisting the allied blockade against Germany, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mises.org/library/blockade-and-attempted-starvation-germany&quot;&gt;pursued by Britain&lt;/a&gt; in 1915-1919.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likewise, the Quakers resisted the economic sanctions against Iraq imposed by US State Department secretaries Madeline Albright and Condoleezza Rice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Nixon-Kissinger policies versus the Vietnamese were likewise cast as morally bankrupt and illegitimate.&amp;nbsp; Those of us in the liberal wing at least, welcomed &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/10/hotel-oregon.html&quot;&gt;Jane Fonda&#39;s visit to Hanoi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then US intelligencia has long decried Manifest Destiny syndrome and its craven craving for imperial powers.&amp;nbsp; Such craving is both the weak spot and the blind spot in the American psyche, as many historians will aver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any modeling of the USG on ancient Rome&#39;s imperial chapters, has never sat well with many who&#39;d supported the American Revolution in principle, George Washington included.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A core goal of the latter was to get free of monarchs and their imperial designs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course calling US policies &quot;imperialist&quot; always sounded kinda corny, the way those Commies talked.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s until we got to reading the more serious histories and journalism and understood better how the shoe fit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I don&#39;t find it surprising that I think a lot like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/04/our-hero-mr-ed.html&quot;&gt;Mark Twain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/10/wanderers-20161026.html&quot;&gt;William James&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to the Philippine-American war.&amp;nbsp; I lived in the Philippines long enough myself to do some thinking on this relationship.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These days I look at Puerto Rico, the lawsuit by the Marshall Islands against the nuclear powers (which the World Court decided not to hear), and the Ban Treaty, working its way through the UN General Assembly, and think this sort of non-violent defiance against nuke heads is very sane.&lt;/div&gt;

Long time readers of my writings, such as any remain (of my writings, as well as of long time readers), may have come across my use of &quot;andragogy&quot; a lot, in contrast to &quot;pedagogy&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2016, &quot;andragogy&quot; is a recognized word, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andragogy&quot;&gt;in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; and so on, however spellcheckers generally won&#39;t have it, out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Andragogy means &quot;the teaching of adults&quot; whereas &quot;pedagogy&quot; is about teaching children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, &quot;child&quot; and &quot;adult&quot; (&quot;peda&quot; and &quot;andra&quot;) are cultural categories and vary depending on how much childhood is even recognized, or how.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Eugene&lt;span class=&quot;_1lr-components-CreatorPageV3HeadNavBar--creatorName&quot; data-reactid=&quot;.0.0.0.2.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.0.0&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;.0.0.0.2.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.0&quot;&gt; Khutoryansky&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-reactid=&quot;.0.0.0.2.0.1.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.1.0.0.1&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;points out in &lt;a href=&quot;http://veganfaq.net/children.html&quot;&gt;one of his rants&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Why Children Should Rebel&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Our current concept of childhood is a relatively recent
invention. Throughout most cultures throughout most of human
history, individuals today referred to as &quot;children&quot;
had the right to marry, serve in the army, and even act as the
head of state. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
I bring up Eugene on purpose as really his work is what I&#39;m surveying today, having just come across it this morning.&amp;nbsp; He has produced and published some interesting physics and mathematics teaching movies.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/user/EugeneKhutoryansky/videos&quot;&gt;Check them out&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I wrote to PhysLrnr-L, which I joined on invitation of Dr. Bob Fuller, whom I collaborated with on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/04/more-first-person-physics.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;First Person Physics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Is the surreality of Eugene&#39;s world extraneous?&amp;nbsp; A cat watches the action in the Quantum Mechanics video, while the Maxwell&#39;s Equations one is inhabited by two angels in a somewhat Gothic setting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given &quot;Maxwell&#39;s Demon&quot; is already in the literature, and that we&#39;ve all heard of Schrodinger&#39;s Cat, I didn&#39;t see the imagery as entirely extraneous.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s alluding to known memes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the mnemonic arts since Cicero and earlier, the idea of using exaggerated-because-more- memorable imagery has been encouraged.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I&#39;ve got a slide show and maybe a recorded talk called &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/1102&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pythonic Andragogy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; out there somewhere (once as a Lightning Talk in Santa Clara, at a Pycon).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I taught Python, the computer language, to adults a lot.&amp;nbsp; But then weren&#39;t &lt;i&gt;Saturday Academy&lt;/i&gt; students pretty adult-like in some cases?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, culture and ethnicity mean many parameters stay in play, as we investigate whether andragogy deserves a long term future. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The scruffy hacker story, wherein Fancy Bear sparks indignation across the board, owing to connected Wikileaks revelations, meets expectations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/feeling-bern.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/feeling-bern.html&quot;&gt;Bernie&lt;/a&gt; is close to Commie himself right?&amp;nbsp; So sure it makes sense these idealistic &quot;open sourcerers&quot; would be seeking revenge over how he was treated by Hilarious Hillary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lots of geriatrics have fallen for that phishing trick and easily empathize with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/10/email-woes.html&quot;&gt;poor AOL users&lt;/a&gt; and so on.&amp;nbsp; The white hat script kiddies are happy to explain how it all works, to their puzzled parents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other story is about the Internet of Things and how a bunch of wayward appliances all rose up in unison to attack &lt;i&gt;Twitter&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Netflix&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Spotify&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This wasn&#39;t phishing, but something new.&amp;nbsp; Actually denial of service using bots and zombie computers is not new at all, but we&#39;re to understand the scale and focus of the attack was record-setting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scruffy hackers, connected to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/10/email-woes.html&quot;&gt;the Russians&lt;/a&gt; by as much slathered innuendo as possible (no wait, one of the long gone founders of the KGB had his name mistakenly not removed!) have the tamer old fart tech.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Fancy Bear is Russia, or at least a branch of the Russian government, 
taking the gloves off,” said one official in the Department of Defense. 
“It’s unlike anything else we’ve seen, and so we are struggling with 
writing a new playbook to respond.” The official would speak only on 
condition of anonymity, as his office had been barred from discussing 
with the press the US response to Fancy Bear’s attacks. “If Fancy Bear 
were a kid in the playground, it would be the kid stealing all the juice
 out of your lunch box and then drinking it in front of you, daring you 
to let him get away with it.&amp;nbsp; [ &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/meet-fancy-bear-the-russian-group-hacking-the-us-election&quot;&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; ] &lt;/blockquote&gt;
In contrast, the masterminds behind the toys, the attacking &quot;things,&quot; seem to be getting away with their nefarious antics scot-free, with almost no questions asked.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Few leads&quot; says &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Russians seem to be manageable Bernie supporters, geeks in their basements with too much time on their hands.&amp;nbsp; Their motives seem understandable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dot com attackers, on the other hand, seem to still have their off switch and an army not easily stopped.&amp;nbsp; The corporate muggles are admitting their laziness.&amp;nbsp; Yes, their &quot;things&quot; may be gamed.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t forget to change your toaster&#39;s password.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&quot;Nothing survives floods of this nature, existing or theoretical, 
centralized or decentralized,” Kaminsky said. “It all falls over. The 
hard questions here are about preventing this sort of exposure in the 
first place, and about improving our ability to respond and remediate 
when we do get it wrong.” Prevention and remediation are the only 
options in the kind of attack that paralyzed Dyn, Kaminsky said. [&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/25/ddos-cyber-attack-dyn-internet-of-things&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This second, apparently not-Russian cabal, flipped their switch on and off a couple times, while engineers scrambled to &quot;mitigate&quot; the effects, however there&#39;s little evidence of real defenses or any actual mitigation.&amp;nbsp; The attacks simply ceased, ready to begin again another day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Supposedly Homeland Security was looking into it.&amp;nbsp; How about the FBI?&amp;nbsp; In terms of how big a vulnerability was exposed, the scruffy Wikileaks phishing scandal doesn&#39;t hold a candle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Duping individuals is little league compared to bringing down a core name server.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The upshot is someone with an off switch for the Internet is newly enthroned as Voldemort, while the Russians get to play second fiddle as scruffy hacker idealists, more Snowden types, in league with Anonymous no doubt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The implication in the case of Fancy Bear is youthful rebellion on display, whereas the other attack is both more ominous and more unconscious, more sleep-inducing, more forgettable.&amp;nbsp; The corporate persons seem more eager to play dead, or at least roll over.&amp;nbsp; The Russians seem less scary, less a giant to obey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re not really planning a lot of &quot;who did it&quot; stories in the latter case are we?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s more a tale of grin and bear it. You&#39;re at the mercy of Voldemort, and don&#39;t forget it — now forget it, until we remind you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course there&#39;s been some attempt to connect these two stories, I&#39;m aware of that.&amp;nbsp; Wikileaks is getting its revenge for some stale state trying too hard to be a hero.&amp;nbsp; That connection is not widely alleged however, only whispered into the rumor mill (or maybe bull horned if from Alex Jones).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another bed time story is &quot;911 was an inside job&quot; but there I&#39;d have to say why tell it that way?&amp;nbsp; A cabal of desperate outsiders, feeling powerless, thought this might be a way to seize control, and nothing panned out how it was supposed to.&amp;nbsp; Whatever the point of the plot, it got lost.&amp;nbsp; So much for &quot;insiders&quot; right?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30549488256/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Prepared to Vote&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Prepared to Vote&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8624/30549488256_2b14a8ff55.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I brought my ballot along, and the &lt;i&gt;Portland Mercury&lt;/i&gt; for some guidance on the more esoteric measures.&amp;nbsp; I was gonna vote in front of everyone, as a fun input to the conversation.&amp;nbsp; However I don&#39;t have the right blue or black ink pen.&amp;nbsp; By the end of today for sure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We agree about &lt;i&gt;Measure 97&lt;/i&gt; (the paper editors and I), whereas &lt;i&gt;Willamette Week&lt;/i&gt; came out against it.&amp;nbsp; Probably not enough information about where the money would go has come forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand suspicion about abuse.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve urged these big companies that&#39;d pay more in taxes, to get involved in public policy more explicitly, like &lt;i&gt;Mentor Graphics&lt;/i&gt; does.&amp;nbsp; That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean creating more charter schools.&amp;nbsp; How does one create &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2808442&quot;&gt;new public schools&lt;/a&gt; that are not charter schools, by the way?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we started at &lt;i&gt;Sunnyside Elementary&lt;/i&gt;, a bevy of parents had built a school within the school, and even had some hire-fire responsibilities vis-a-vis the teachers. This was a public school.&amp;nbsp; In Portland, anything is possible, might be a useful motto, even if the &quot;laws of physics&quot; still pertain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For one thing, big companies (if I may address you as personhoods for a moment), tell us more about how we&#39;re to integrate math teaching with coding skills.&amp;nbsp; Just telling the high schools they need to hire an army of computer science teachers, leaving math immutable, is not gonna fly. Suggestions?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not being sarcastic; I have my own &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/10/revisiting-lambda-calc.html&quot;&gt;very good ideas&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; So if someone like me, a steep property tax payer, is able to offer strong answers, maybe a fancy pants CEO might do the same?&amp;nbsp; Not that I have anything against &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/mens-fashions.html&quot;&gt;fancy pants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of immutability, the MVC pattern (Model View Controller) has taken a turn, with React coders understanding the data flow as more &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/09/more-curriculum-writing-re-mvc.html&quot;&gt;unidirectional and circular&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Components, represented &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/10/javascript-for-pythonistas.html&quot;&gt;in JavaScript&lt;/a&gt;, pass down info about state changes to their children on a need to know basis, whereas changes to state through the UI get tossed on the heap without trying to talk directly to other components.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;ll be updated soon enough.&amp;nbsp; Treat state as a giant global.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Conway&#39;s Law says all this micro-stuff (how we code) has maxi-consequences in the form of organizational structures.&amp;nbsp; We self-organize as we conceptualize, is another way of saying it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Think of sitting in your cubicle and getting the usual memo traffic.&amp;nbsp; Suddenly, you have a great insight or idea.&amp;nbsp; Rather than passing it &quot;up the chain&quot; from manager to manager, just stick it in your Github account and let sifters and peer reviewers note the state changes. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
React was tossed on the heap as open source by Facebook, in danger of dying from the complexity of its own code until this new paradigm got some legs.&amp;nbsp; React is typically used with JSX, a way of avoiding a templating language like&lt;i&gt; Jinja2&lt;/i&gt; and just sticking with mostly HTML inside of JavaScript functions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30592004945/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;WJ Bio&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;WJ Bio&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8664/30592004945_6a6e943e29.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last night I breezed through a bio of William James on my shelves (so many borrowed books I&#39;ve not read!), learning of his huge disappointment over living in an imperialist bubble.&amp;nbsp; He was distraught over the US-Philippines war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Politicians today register faux shocked surprise that the RP might be registering independence and siding with China more. The Philippines is not wanting to be proxy-maneuvered by Uncle Sam into some faux fight over fish, duh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quakers were semi-disgusted from the beginning, with the pell-mell eagerness of the human creature to make war, not love.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Lets fight them Injuns&quot; was the morons&#39; battle cry.&amp;nbsp; And so it was. Quakers resisted stooping to that low an EQ (same as IQ in the Garden) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/catholic-analysis.html&quot;&gt;lost much of their clout&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Making war is far easier than building an initially fragile set of trusted relationships, later codified, then institutionalized, to make torch-passing easier.&amp;nbsp; The costs get postponed to a time when paying those costs get disconnected from root causes, and people therefore stay confused enough to be bullied into wanting yet more war.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
James also found USers too high strung, too on edge.&amp;nbsp; This was well before &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/10/meme-machine.html&quot;&gt;Frenetic TV&lt;/a&gt; (a subtype of Hectic, a cousin of Hysterical).&amp;nbsp; What would he say today?&amp;nbsp; That USers are crazy?&amp;nbsp; Where&#39;s the news there?&amp;nbsp; USers hyperventilate excessively, reports the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; (can you see the headline?) — pretty much on cue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I remember celebrating the 1999-2000 odometer flip-over in Lesotho and watching each culture celebrate as the world turned, on the BBC.&amp;nbsp; People were upbeat about it all, enjoying themselves, until we came to the US time zones, where people were crazed about Y2K.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Are the fighters still flying?&quot; &quot;Check&quot;&amp;nbsp; &quot;Are the war ships still sailing?&quot; &quot;Check&quot;. William James had a point I think. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30498324745/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Rated R for Sex &amp;amp; Drugs&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Rated R for Sex &amp;amp; Drugs&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; src=&quot;https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8679/30498324745_957272c8d6.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Michael Moore films follow the same pattern, well known in journalism, wherein we get to know the journalist as one of the players, an actor in front of the camera. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Omniscient narrator&quot; documentaries, if political in content, tend to sound phony, though many oldsters will still hear a &lt;i&gt;Wild Kingdom&lt;/i&gt; interpretation of animal behavior without hearing a mockumentary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s much to say about how the ear is tuned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So here&#39;s this bumbling guy, playing the &quot;dumb American,&quot; stumbling around Europe and North Africa, getting a positive echo from the difference the USA makes, or made.&amp;nbsp; All those reforms Americans fought for paid off, in other countries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Better benefits in Italy, school food in France, no drug wars or death penalty in Portugal, better prisons in Norway, better schools in Finland, more women&#39;s rights in Iceland and Tunisia, more affordable higher education in Slovenia.&amp;nbsp; The list goes on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone gets more paid vacation than average USers.&amp;nbsp; Moore doesn&#39;t even mention &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fordfoundation.org/ideas/equals-change-blog/posts/american-tipping-is-rooted-in-slavery-and-it-still-hurts-workers-today/&quot;&gt;working for tips&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now these relatively happy and enlightened people are hoping what they see on TV about Michael Moore&#39;s home country is not their worst nightmare coming true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Michael Moore appears to come from some hell people wish to avoid, at this point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How might we explain this grave turnaround in reputation, and will the USA recover?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The explanation offered has to do with a &quot;race to the top&quot; being harder to win than a &quot;race to the bottom&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The recipe then, was to criminalize all &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/drug-pushers.html&quot;&gt;drug pushing&lt;/a&gt; outside legal advertising, as a way to keep people down and out and/or hard at work within &quot;chain gang&quot; prison colonies, thereby providing prison labor to &lt;i&gt;Victoria&#39;s Secret&lt;/i&gt; and many others.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Operate some kind of Gulag in other words. Perpetuate slavery. Practice eugenics (war against the weak).&lt;br /&gt;

Whether Michael&#39;s country will bounce back or not is one of the major soap opera concerns of our time, and if Wagner were alive he&#39;d likely have given us some great Hollywood soundtracks about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ll settle for Weird Al.  Like John Oliver, he&#39;s wondering if this really could be hell that we&#39;ve entered, have actually been in for quite awhile maybe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/10/mystics.html&quot;&gt;Carol&lt;/a&gt; has been especially eager to see this latest major box office Michael Moore flick.&amp;nbsp; She watched it from the big chair, wrapped in a quilt, eating popcorn. &lt;br /&gt;

On kind invitation from Patrick, I walked over to his household, by way of &lt;i&gt;New Seasons&lt;/i&gt; where I stoked up on prepared foods: chicken, brussels sprouts, macaroni and rice. &amp;nbsp;Patrick picked the beer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I enjoyed watching the debate, the 3rd twixt the two ruling parties, with an affectionate corgi (brand of dog) jumping all over me. &amp;nbsp;Spencer joined us, while Katie flittered in and out. &amp;nbsp;That was the purpose of my visit, to take in this program.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/bwvlbJ0h35A&quot;&gt;first world concern&lt;/a&gt;&quot; adding actionable items to my &quot;to do&quot; list today is the HTC phone from &lt;i&gt;Verizon&lt;/i&gt;, which as of two days ago is actually losing charge while plugged into a charger. &amp;nbsp;Turning it off while charging just barely holds the line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scouring the Internet leaves the door wide open as to whether it&#39;s a software or hardware glitch (I suspect the battery is shot, not the charging port). &amp;nbsp;In any case, it&#39;s soon to be a brick, and I&#39;m still paying for it, so time to pay a visit to my local &lt;i&gt;Verizon&lt;/i&gt; storefront.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suppose the biggest takeaway, for me, was not &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/20/13341416/nasty-woman-feminist-rallying-cry-hillary-clinton&quot;&gt;nasty woman&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (Trump&#39;s remark) but the role of &quot;Russians&quot; in the national dialog. &amp;nbsp;In other times, Georgia (the Black Sea bordering region) and Crimea were maybe more front and center, or Ukraine, but now it&#39;s all cyber and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/08/the-youtube-channel.html&quot;&gt;Wikileaks flavored&lt;/a&gt;, even while Aleppo is deemed to have &quot;fallen&quot; to its own Assad government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whereas Gary Johnson (the Libertarian candidate) may not have known Aleppo was a city in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/06/about-elly-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Mesopotamia&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m guessing very few political insiders could name all seventeen USG intelligence agencies that Hillary could cite as sharing her concerns about spies helping the Kremlin. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More Americans probably know that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avclub.com/article/archer-drops-isis-name-suddenly-finds-itself-bunch-210378&quot;&gt;Archer worked for ISIS&lt;/a&gt; and that the Kremlin rebranded the KGB as something else, just like &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/drinking-liberally.html&quot;&gt;the CIA&lt;/a&gt; underwent a facelift to become just &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-shepherd.html&quot;&gt;one of seventeen services&lt;/a&gt; — can you name them?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trump is all about &quot;dealing with ISIS&quot; first, a goal he believes he shares with Vlad Putin, but then not the way they&#39;re doing it now, by staging a big battle for Mosul, a city to be &quot;taken back&quot; by Iraq. Donald ridiculed the Democrats for letting go of Mosul in the first place. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He takes a position somewhat consistent with Make America Great Again in casting Democrats on the losing side of history. ISIS won&#39;t be there given all the advanced notice to move elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s where the Russians come in, as outplaying the Obama administration. &amp;nbsp;In a way, that&#39;s a constructive role, as it&#39;s somewhat like poker or chess, and we see the Dems are incompetent so why not give a smart business man a chance? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m personally buying this rhetoric or narrative, only that I believe I&#39;m fairly characterizing the Republican candidate&#39;s position. &amp;nbsp;He likes it when we&#39;re fair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I live in Portland, Oregon which I&#39;d say was most definitely &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/feeling-bern.html&quot;&gt;a Bernie town&lt;/a&gt; (as in Bernie Sanders). The sense &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/notes-from-a-silicon-forester-76d66d2f8742#.7o9x40xtn&quot;&gt;among Cascadians&lt;/a&gt; is DC is well past its prime in its ability to cough up credible theater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The screen writing has gotten even worse than mediocre, and really has more to do with misguided ventures already in the rear view mirror. &amp;nbsp;Republican president Eisenhower was right to warn us of big business inertia and its need for war as a business expense — could be a &quot;cold&quot; one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of cyber-war, I don&#39;t think the Russians&#39; role vis-a-vis the US, here in October in 2016, is all that destructive. We&#39;re getting more immediate and relevant insight into how the game of politics is played, e.g. the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/10/bed-time-stories.html&quot;&gt;shoving aside of Bernie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plus companies and committees (e.g. the DNC) are learning that keeping secrets is a real challenge when they&#39;re also hot properties, and this has been true since the village over the hill discovered the secrets of the catapult.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spies might be sent over to catch up on the latest tech, or defectors encouraged to come over and spill the beans. How do these human behavior patterns work themselves out&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/tcpip-for-gnubees.html&quot;&gt;in tcp/ip world&lt;/a&gt; and beyond? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sophistication around encryption is definitely a big part of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Businesses engaged in cyber-security for a living are being galvanized by the &quot;Russian threat&quot; and that could be good for the bottom line, in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/10/meme-machine.html&quot;&gt;purely capitalist&lt;/a&gt; sense. &amp;nbsp;As many security experts have been warning us, the tools of war are becoming ever more invisible. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The front line is not in Aleppo or Mosul so much, nor in outer space, but in cyber-space or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/09/reading-dynamics.html&quot;&gt;Cyberia&lt;/a&gt;&quot; as some have called it, and as the debate proves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Followup:&amp;nbsp; &#39;twaz indeed the battery, new HTC One device on the way. &lt;br /&gt;

[ from emails to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/08/code-school-evening.html&quot;&gt;Nathaniel Bobbitt &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I haven&#39;t read &lt;a href=&quot;http://human-nature.com/nibbs/03/kohler.html&quot;&gt;Peter Hacker&#39;s book&lt;/a&gt; yet, but having studied Wittgenstein, I somewhat get &lt;a href=&quot;http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2010/10/peter_hackers_c.html&quot;&gt;where he&#39;s coming from&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Wittgenstein&#39;s philo we&#39;re trained to see words gaining meaning 
through use, not through pointing to phenomena.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Words do not point&quot; 
might be the slogan.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ergo &quot;understanding&quot; &quot;thinking&quot; and &quot;pain&quot; connect to introspected &quot;mental events&quot; in only tenuous / tangential ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not much temptation on my end to imagine &quot;understanding&quot; as a &quot;brain process&quot; in any direct one-to-one literal sense.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saying
 &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/10/intelligent-design.html&quot;&gt;bacteria respond intelligently&lt;/a&gt; to stresses in the environment&quot; is not 
metaphoric nor anthropomorphic usage, merely an extension of common 
everyday usage.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ergo an &quot;intelligent response&quot; requires no brains at all (bacteria don&#39;t have them).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The supposition that &quot;desire&quot; &quot;empathy&quot; &quot;false belief&quot; are &quot;mental 
states&quot; in the sense of signature brain configurations, is extremely 
alien to my way of thinking but doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t be useful in 
motivating pattern matching and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23498713_Are_There_Theory_of_Mind_Regions_in_the_Brain_A_Review_of_the_Neuroimaging_Literature&quot;&gt;ToM reasoning skills&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&quot;Bucky stuff&quot; on CBS Morning Show (2009)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This well-produced 2009 segment reminds us of the &quot;Bucky stuff&quot; focuses on the practical applications of Fuller&#39;s ideas, which is not a mistake in any way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, my &quot;stridency&quot; (one might call it) in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/09/whispering-campaign.html&quot;&gt;my Tweets&lt;/a&gt; (can anything called a &quot;tweet&quot; be &quot;strident&quot;?) stems from the &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; coherence of the unit volume tetrahedron idea.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even with no practical applications (which it has), there&#39;d be (is) a mathematics here, an approach to spatial geometry, worth passing on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The different models of 2nd and 3rd powering, how to map 2x2 and 2x2x2 to respective areas and volumes, are where to start.&amp;nbsp; My Youtube below sets the stage.&amp;nbsp; I continue with the story under the heading of so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikieducator.org/Martian_Math&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Martian Math&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — one of many ways to go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At this point, I&#39;d say some understanding of &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt; (the name of Fuller&#39;s two-volume magnum opus) and its subsequent influence, as well as its influences (what fed into it), are required simply to understand recent intellectual history.&amp;nbsp; Is that kind of history important?&amp;nbsp; To many readers, it still is.&lt;br /&gt;

If you know nothing about UVT, don&#39;t even think about being US president, you&#39;ll be too ignorant of US history to merit the job. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/4D?src=hash&quot;&gt;#4D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

UVT means you get a conceptual kit of spatial shapes with nice whole number volumes. Kepler&#39;s fave, rhombic dodeca, has volume 6. Wow, easy.&lt;/div&gt;

Is it that the UK wants the US to ignore a homegrown genius?  That might be it.  Check your math textbooks.  UVT?  Even just in a sidebar?&lt;/div&gt;

One might think Barbara Oakley, author of the linked article [1], would&#39;ve hit on the strategy of reading in STEM subjects in Russian, unifying and consolidated her skills in that manner.&amp;nbsp; I used Russian pamphlets on the Calculus, in translation, when a calculus teacher at St. Dominic Academy.&amp;nbsp; I was a pretty good calculus teacher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her critique echoes &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foundersspace.com/mentors/scott-gray-founders-space-instructor/&quot;&gt;Scott Gray&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;Making Math&lt;/i&gt;, co-founder of &lt;i&gt;Useractive&lt;/i&gt; which later morphed into &lt;i&gt;O&#39;Reilly School&lt;/i&gt; (of Technology).&amp;nbsp; One needs to learn by doing, meaning practice makes perfect, whereas just watching videos (Youtubes) leads to a more vicarious understanding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Conceptual understanding&quot; may prove paper thin, too fragile, when stressed by the &quot;real world&quot;.&amp;nbsp; At the school, we emphasized &quot;hands on&quot; intensely, to the exclusion of any video from the curriculum proper, though as mentors we were free to cite useful Youtubes for background viewing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m glad to see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.geneseo.edu/pipermail/math-thinking-l/2016-September/000785.html&quot;&gt;infamous Forum 206&lt;/a&gt; at the Math Forum has come back to life.&amp;nbsp; That listserv is really a vehicle for the NCTM (a US-based entity) so I&#39;m refraining from jumping back in — unless and until I have some official role with said entity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I thought Stephen Colbert took some risks last night, jumping up and down, getting the energy going, then letting that slinky soap opera star, Judith Light, yak about &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; (Amazon too) rather openly, with Stephen saying he wanted to join a cult.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They agreed CBS is a cult already, plus &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; now lets you go to the bathroom (they did then too but no need to get technical [1]).&amp;nbsp; Anyway it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/at-landmark-event.html&quot;&gt;not called &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; anymore. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They both talked about getting naked for the theater, not always the hardest thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The joke around here is &quot;What&#39;s more believable:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/i&gt; about &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;Frontline&lt;/i&gt; on 911?&quot; Har har.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/tv-ethnography.html&quot;&gt;TV is just right&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;true believer&quot; personalities, right?&amp;nbsp; Talk about cult-like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Beekeeper Morgan Freeman, the first guest, is a producer director for the new &lt;i&gt;Madam Secretary&lt;/i&gt; show, which draws inspiration from three recent figures of empire: Albright, Rice and Clinton.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However it&#39;s a science fictional show (not a documentary) and won&#39;t lead Americans astray into understanding too much about actual foreign policy.&amp;nbsp; For that you&#39;d need &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/03/a-tale-of-two-movies.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Covert Affairs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-tv-talk.html&quot;&gt;maybe &lt;i&gt;Buffy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[1] your agreement was to sit 
in the back row if you were one of those &quot;bathroom at will&quot; people, 
otherwise wait for the breaks like a normal person OK?&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t go &quot;excuse me excuse me&quot; climbing over knees, while someone is sharing their heart out. &lt;/div&gt;

&quot;Much of the &#39;general public&#39; is involved in at least stratagems, to sell soap, real estate, used cars, health insurance... you name it.  Some of the stuff you need, some you don&#39;t, and some you really don&#39;t (but they manage to sell it anyway).  I wouldn&#39;t undersell the general public as all that unsophisticated.  They feign contempt, but then they do it for a living.&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
That was me &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quakerquaker.org/forum/topics/extreme-prejudice-by-susan-lindauer?commentId=2360685%3AComment%3A148247&quot;&gt;on QuakerQuaker&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;i&gt;Quarterworld&lt;/i&gt; has been on my radar, but I&#39;ve been slow in going there.&amp;nbsp; Once I&#39;d settled in for a long stay, I discovered entombed Facebook messages going back to 2010, under &quot;Filtered&quot;.&amp;nbsp; I included some apologies.&amp;nbsp; One guy said he was really into Quadray Coordinates.&amp;nbsp; I sent him a link to my most recent mention of same, earlier that very day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The marquee said something like Tesla Show, 4 - 9, meaning at 4, and then another show, at 9 PM.&amp;nbsp; However given my propensity for misreading stuff, I was picturing some five hour display of a Tesla&#39;s powers.&amp;nbsp; &quot;What could that even mean?&quot; I joked in an email.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d read the marquee wrong.&amp;nbsp; Each show lasts about 15 minutes, with lightning bolts synchronized to music.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m at the code school this Monday night, per usual, opting not to glue myself to what most USers are watching:&amp;nbsp; the Hilladon talking to itself, like &lt;i&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/i&gt;, but a lot scarier.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
People are funny about security sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They claim to want &quot;end to end encryption&quot; to protect their privacy in coffee shops.&amp;nbsp; The technology is indeed ingenious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then they shout into their cell phones at the tops of their lungs on the bus, or have intimate conversations we all overhear, unless using ear buds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes the &quot;stage whispers&quot; are almost deafening.&amp;nbsp; But then sometimes an audience isn&#39;t used to hearing them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People clamor for privacy, then publish selfies in the shower.&amp;nbsp; How are we able to have it all ways?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do we get to have the cake, eat it, sell it, and do other unmentionable things with it, all at the same time?&amp;nbsp; Wow, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Look for the HTTPS icon in your browser&#39;s address spot, if security is a real concern.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of web content is like rock formations in the desert.&amp;nbsp; Do you really need encryption to look at that gila monster?&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t freak out if &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/08/addendum-regarding-ssl-tls.html&quot;&gt;TLS&lt;/a&gt; is not engaged.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re not always in ATM mode, right?&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Glenn had called ahead and we knew the staff was likely engaged in workshops.&amp;nbsp; Tomorrow is the open house.&amp;nbsp; We decided to visit in any case, having blocked it out, taking the art car.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those new to my blogs, the &quot;art car&quot; is an old Nissan sedan I let a pregnant couple spray paint in a parking lot for some dollars.&amp;nbsp; The guy was right I was just letting it rust and some auto products on the market could seal in resale value, then leaking away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The art car, also known as &quot;maxi taxi&quot; came after Razz, the raspberry-colored Subaru wagon, who&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/6QZCDj&quot;&gt;final resting place&lt;/a&gt; before junkyard we drove by on the way out.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/02/another-superbowl.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Razz&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was driveable to the end, just suffered a mishap in the high desert, a story recounted somewhere in here I&#39;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not like I&#39;m rich or anything (I&#39;m a teacher), more a case of the poor helping the poor, which published journals say goes on a lot in this world.&amp;nbsp; Community is more than just socializing.&amp;nbsp; Pet care, community gardening, creating new Biosphere type places:&amp;nbsp; humans engage in all that.&amp;nbsp; Even around here.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fine with having an art car, though I may keep fine tuning the look.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hedron&lt;/i&gt; is a maker space we found out about at &lt;i&gt;Maker Faire&lt;/i&gt; (see previous post), an exhibitor in the 3D printer section (at OMSI, indoors).&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been suggesting math teachers go against their own textbooks, somewhat the way some stronger &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/revisiting-911.html&quot;&gt;history teachers&lt;/a&gt; do, using state mandated texts as examples or specimens, artifacts, not just regurgitating what&#39;s in them, not merely taking them at face value as it were.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what if they never talk about the MITE (&quot;minimum tetrahedron&quot; cite Aristotle) in your geometry textbook? That doesn&#39;t mean you, a math teacher, can&#39;t go to &lt;i&gt;Hedron&lt;/i&gt; and 3D print your own kits for classroom sharing.&amp;nbsp; Point out what&#39;s missing, as well as what&#39;s included.&amp;nbsp; The new generations are here to go beyond what earlier generations have accomplished, not parrot or ape them, duh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, a had my &lt;i&gt;Pergamon Press&lt;/i&gt; bag (like a tote bag) full of plastic MITEs (some a present from D. Koski years ago) and left them a few, along with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/plates/figs/plate03z.html&quot;&gt;the poster&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;Synergetics Folio&lt;/i&gt; as included in the 2nd volume by Macmillan as well. That poster is the basis for a 3D printable kit the math teachers in project #CodeCastle will get to share about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That color plate or poster is where the MITE is broken down into A &amp;amp; B modules — the kind of stuff I&#39;ve taken to tweeting about.&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;I got this &lt;i&gt;Pergamon Press&lt;/i&gt; swag bag at the &lt;i&gt;First International Conference on Buckminsterfullerene&lt;/i&gt; in Santa Barbara, as a part of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isepp.org/&quot;&gt;ISEPP&lt;/a&gt; fellowship, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bfi.org/&quot;&gt;BFI&lt;/a&gt; also supportive.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
We went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlaspizzapdx.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Atlas&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; later for pizza.&amp;nbsp; I grabbed a &lt;i&gt;Mercury&lt;/i&gt;, the issue with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/welcome-to-portland/Content?oid=16495991&quot;&gt;the &lt;i&gt;Newcomers Guide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, somewhat tongue in cheek per &lt;i&gt;Mercury&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; style.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re reviewing the parks and saying &lt;i&gt;Colonel Summers&lt;/i&gt; is a good one, but the editors take issue with the presumed reviewer&#39;s comment about &quot;hipsters&quot; plaguing the park, observing these are outright &quot;hippies&quot;, a different species.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The joke is insiders writing for outsiders is another way of insiders showing off to other insiders.&amp;nbsp; I could go on and on about &lt;i&gt;Colonel Summers&lt;/i&gt; park and my adventures there with &lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Not far from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcmenamins.com/313-barley-mill-pub-home&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barley Mill&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the McMenamins&#39; first, on Hawthorne &amp;amp; SE 17th.&amp;nbsp; Of course in reality the hipsters er hippies are integral to Portland&#39;s color and charm.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Glenn and I headed for &lt;i&gt;Maker Faire&lt;/i&gt;, a mini version by some standards, with a known purpose, which I summarize as HP4E:&amp;nbsp; hexapents for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those just joining us, the &quot;hexapent&quot; is a way of subdividing the surface of a sphere with mostly hexagons, a few pentagons, the soccer ball pattern being a first instance.&amp;nbsp; You might call that a truncated icosahedron, or even a buckminsterfullerene molecule, relative of nanotubes, graphene, other carbon allotropes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In recent blog posts, and tweets, I&#39;ve been cranking out some hexapent examples (see below) using Adrian Rossiter&#39;s Antiprism software, compiled for the Raspberry Pi and rendered on same using POV-ray from &lt;a href=&quot;http://povray.org/&quot;&gt;povray.org&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; These are simply still pictures, more for the exterior of the shrink-wrapped box, were the games we&#39;re planning actually sold that way anymore (in plastic-wrapped boxes).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We found the gamer community, showcasing indoors (where we started), ahead of the curve, as predicted by &lt;i&gt;Civilization&lt;/i&gt;, a classic hexagonaly-tiled god&#39;s eye view program.&amp;nbsp; Veterans of &lt;i&gt;Civilization&lt;/i&gt; are quite well-versed in the hexapent lore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We asked about the state of the game engine economy, specifically whether anything open source could serve as a basis for Glenn&#39;s many game theme ideas.&amp;nbsp; Given his years of scholarship, he&#39;s brimming with fantasy simulations, some of which connect to known science.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Game World, it&#39;s fine to indulge in fantasies of lost sciences also.&amp;nbsp; Those who despise mixing genres, such as &quot;illusionist&quot; with &quot;real magician&quot; (an oxymoron for them), will welcome the same content provided genre rules are obeyed.&amp;nbsp; We don&#39;t have to insist that only true believers play, whatever it is, that sniggering skeptics back off.&amp;nbsp; On the contrary, anyone is welcome to judge these games how they will, plus roll their own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using hexagonal tiles is a standard already, no worries that I&#39;m barging in and claiming ownership of ideas as old as the hills.&amp;nbsp; #CodeCastle philosophy isn&#39;t like that.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of which, this community center model I&#39;ve been promoting under the hashtag #CodeCastle would resemble a Maker Fair in many ways, just as the Maker Fair resembles OMSI.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, in touring the Maker Fair, we found ourselves wandering through OMSI&#39;s own exhibit construction space — more of the same, really.&amp;nbsp; Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given I&#39;ve been strutting Raspbian artifacts around town, I made a special point of visiting the Intel booth to learn for about the Edison and Minnow.&amp;nbsp; The latter is closer to the Pi in what it&#39;s for, a platform for operating systems and applications. The booth guy said the Minnow was &quot;more powerful&quot; that the Pi, which is likely true as the ARM chip is low power by design.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A side benefit of starting in the gamer room is we met up with Don and Tim, in charge of the Tesla coil exhibit and stage presentation.&amp;nbsp; Their largest coil is not easily accommodated by OMSI, though they managed last year.&amp;nbsp; A half million volts would be sufficient.&amp;nbsp; We went back for the light show later, by way of 3D Printer-ville, where Skip and his son were hard at work.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/01/wanderers-2015113.html&quot;&gt;Skip already knows&lt;/a&gt; about the &quot;hedron stuff&quot;, speaking of which, I need to visit &lt;i&gt;Hedron&lt;/i&gt;, near &lt;i&gt;Bull&#39;s Eye Glass&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had another goal aside from the global data game hexapent motif hunt (the OSMI Gift Shop had that too, if you looked for it), which was to lookup the &lt;i&gt;PDX Code Guild&lt;/i&gt; booth and find &lt;a href=&quot;http://workingit.com/&quot;&gt;WorkingIT.com&lt;/a&gt; staff if I could.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The code school&#39;s booth was easy to find, and Sheri mentioned seeing Margaux hard at work doing interviews.&amp;nbsp; I watched Neil expertly assisting curious visitors with the Scratch-controlled robot, Sheri too.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m admiring of Scratch and would gladly sit behind someone else more expert and more into showing off.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m rather low on the Raspbian totem pole, one might say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn and I stopped at &lt;a href=&quot;http://thebeermongers.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beermongers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the way back, getting some interesting IPAs not on tap in our neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; I rarely get to this watering hole, Irish in flavor.&amp;nbsp; Speaking of which, great getting to walk up Mt. Tabor with Eddy Gunnell the other day.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s a quick-learning Celt, and former co-worker at &lt;i&gt;St. Dominic Academy&lt;/i&gt; in Jersey City, now settled in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I recently learned the mantra that some unnamed nation is into &quot;War and Christmas&quot; as its two major products and themes.&amp;nbsp; To modern ears that sounds Dark Ages, like the Crusades.&amp;nbsp; However some schools promote the Crusaders, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/01/aguirre-wrath-of-god-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;the Conquistadors&lt;/a&gt;, as &quot;the good guys&quot; even to this day, and even the non-violent will speak of &quot;the Lamb&#39;s War&quot; as a metaphysical jihad.&amp;nbsp; Santa actually loves giving out guns, as we learn from many believable Google Images.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Muslims and Christians came together in the civil rights movement, back when Malcolm X and MLK were contemporaries. They didn&#39;t agree, but in striving for greater equality and more respect for human rights, they brought two traditions into close proximity, and put them on the same side.&amp;nbsp; A fusion of Islam with Christianity along some branches, such as Sufi, has already occurred.&amp;nbsp; The Parliament of World Religions events have offered previews.&amp;nbsp; Muhammad Ali followed his conscience in ways Christians around the world openly respected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For my part, I&#39;m not going to blame Americans for not being in the mood to shop until they drop, given all the news they&#39;re getting is to the effect they&#39;ll be dragged through wars for the rest of their lives, even as the planet continues to overheat.&amp;nbsp; Humans appear to be an incompetent species, for all their advantages.&amp;nbsp; Why blame people for wishing (even praying) the world were otherwise?&amp;nbsp; Maybe novels and escapist fiction movies will do well.&amp;nbsp; The November - December lineup of movies promises brief respite from &lt;i&gt;World at War&lt;/i&gt;, at least for a couple hours.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/12/christmas-2016.html&quot;&gt;Cartoons will be big&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Board games and computer games, a few of them serious enough to be &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/08/hp4e-continued.html&quot;&gt;simulations&lt;/a&gt;&quot; will likely sell well.&amp;nbsp; However I think it&#39;s unrealistic to expect civilians to stay completely mindless, even if that&#39;s their supposed economic role.&amp;nbsp; Minus much spark of hope or optimism, objectively measurable, I&#39;m expecting showy Affluenza will be about as popular as Zika as a &quot;look&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Ostentation in trying times has a way of appearing ridiculous, to the point of tasteless.&amp;nbsp; Extravagance and war as a combo, just seems garish.&amp;nbsp; War means frugality and thrift.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not suggesting the malls will be ghost towns.&amp;nbsp; Lloyd Center, one of the first such shopping malls in the country, is working hard on the latest remodel, hoping to recruit more loyal shoppers. However macro-economics matters more than micro-economics sometimes.&amp;nbsp; The world has committed a lot of resources, both physical and metaphysical, for the exclusive use of those into military theatrics.&amp;nbsp; I expect sales of booze and mind-altering substances to remain high, as they do &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/random-zine-covers.html&quot;&gt;in the battle zones&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; People seek to mitigate their pain by whatever means possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some have suggested boycotting the shopping aspect of Christmas, withdrawing consumer support for the economy to the extent civilians get excluded from solving world problems more amicably.&amp;nbsp; This is hardly a new idea. &quot;I&#39;ll do it because I want to and not because you tell me to&quot; (take vows of poverty). Christmas used to come around with the slogan &quot;peace on Earth&quot;, which we&#39;re hearing less and less of late.&amp;nbsp; Minus the meaningfulness of the occasion, shopping &quot;just for the hell of it&quot; starts to lose steam.&amp;nbsp; Civilians become refugees in their own economy. Some sign up for war duty, minus other options.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will some of the new branches (Quaker?) result in new intentional communities?&amp;nbsp; We might be able to get some interesting Reality TV from some of these, and more reasons for hope.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve already brought up the product placement opportunities a million times.&amp;nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t call myself anti-advertising.&amp;nbsp; On the contrary, I&#39;m eager to support a more robust civilian economy.&amp;nbsp; These could be high tech camps (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/08/refugees-camping.html&quot;&gt;campuses&lt;/a&gt;) with ample bandwidth.&amp;nbsp; What companies would sponsor those?&amp;nbsp; REI?&amp;nbsp; North Face?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/about-habitats.html&quot;&gt;Boeing&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Many Jewish faithful are ready to experiment with more promising forms of settlement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having everything &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/iron-mountain-revisted.html&quot;&gt;Iron Mountain&lt;/a&gt; is simply not conducive to celebrating Christmas.&amp;nbsp; War has a Grinch-like effect.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;War and Christmas&quot; business model doesn&#39;t look all that sustainable, but from what I read, many Economists think it&#39;s a given or the best we&#39;ve got, or something along those lines.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m more into GST than Economics, so sometimes have trouble following their logic to its bitter conclusions.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/p4-6qJzeb3A&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Laika&lt;/i&gt; is an Oregon brand, so this film was made in Oregon.&amp;nbsp; The look is quite different from the previewed animations, Glenn and I agreed.&amp;nbsp; We had &lt;i&gt;The Bagdad&lt;/i&gt; almost to ourselves (two other people), as it&#39;s &quot;back to school&quot; and the summer matinee audience has dissipated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the 100% Asian motif, one might consider this a &quot;Japanese&quot; story (which it is), however the stuff of Euro fairy tales fits in fine, from the &lt;i&gt;Sword in the Stone&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Pinocchio&lt;/i&gt;, both childhood favorites to ponder over, in my case, in several versions.&amp;nbsp; I liked to read and movies were harder to come by in those days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The magical powers of Origami, the paper squares, allude to frames of film and the dreams we bring to life using our powers of animation, film magic.&amp;nbsp; The appreciative crowd is the audience, and it&#39;s great to see this movie with one&#39;s grandmother.&amp;nbsp; The extended family matrix, the ancestral tree, is strongly present throughout this &quot;soap opera&quot; involving a jealous grandfather and a disapproved marriage, Kubo the illegitimate offspring (the way grandad sees it).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The protagonist, Kubo, goes from outward storyteller to inward hero, helped by the archetypes to encounter the others he must face.&amp;nbsp; Even the ghost of grandfather helps him along, to confront his own jealousies.&amp;nbsp; The forced march to adulthood requires facing death in many forms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That all sounds rather serious and double-plus un-fun perhaps, but then animations rendered to text, like fairly tales, will tend to sound grim.&amp;nbsp; The artistry and care taken make up for my dismal retelling, many details left out.&amp;nbsp; These stories serve a healing function by cushioning hard lessons in cartoons. Or call it cryptography -- whatever myth-making is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the villagers put lamps in the river, in celebration of the ancestors, I was reminded of our first ceremonies at Oaks Park, along the Willamette, setting afloat such paper lanterns, commemorating souls lost to war, to atom bombs, to all manner of outward violence.&amp;nbsp; My mom had been to Japan in the aftermath of WW2 and was eager for me and my sister to have a less crazy and dangerous world.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s been at it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Death comes soon enough anyway, why not let nature take its own slower course?&amp;nbsp; Humans seem to always go for the gas peddle in some rush to get to some &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mad Max&lt;/i&gt; end times&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Relax and enjoy the roses?&amp;nbsp; Why go for &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/07/dawn-of-planet-of-apes-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Planet of the Apes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; every time the trigger-happy go off half cocked.&amp;nbsp; Do they need their own island?&amp;nbsp; I pondered &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/i&gt; a lot too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn and I had walked around Laurelhurst earlier, discussing his Global Matrix in the context of forward-thinking PR. The world&#39;s gamer community, with the leisure to model civilization using &lt;i&gt;Civilization&lt;/i&gt;, seems eager for a whole planet tiled with hexagons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where should &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/08/hp4e-continued.html&quot;&gt;the twelve pentagons&lt;/a&gt; go?&amp;nbsp; Of course at the poles in some layers but that&#39;s the thing, we have any number of overlays (layers), and not all are about the same things.&amp;nbsp; ESRI&#39;s ArcGIS works the same way, as does Photoshop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suggested a game of &lt;i&gt;Pentagon Go&lt;/i&gt;, with one of the twelve pentagons snug around the US one, with geocaching games around the consequent other eleven, some of which might be in the high seas (I haven&#39;t figured it out yet).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
