This was a kind of role reversal, as she puttered in the kitchen &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/06/fathers-day.html&quot;&gt;while I watched cartoons&lt;/a&gt; (Duckman:  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Apocalypse Not&lt;/span&gt;, Season 3 DVD from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Movie Madness&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#39;m back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/on-job.html&quot;&gt;working the beat&lt;/a&gt; (on duty today) while she forges ahead with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I offered PSF a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3564971422/in/set-72157607350755934/&quot;&gt;chunk of flextegrity&lt;/a&gt; for the OSCON Python booth as a model of &quot;batteries included&quot; (actually, more of a visualization than a model -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/09/more-curriculum-writing-re-mvc.html&quot;&gt;thinking MVC&lt;/a&gt; here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday I backed up 5 DVDs worth of images (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/some-night-shots.html&quot;&gt;Portland Knowledge Lab&lt;/a&gt; stuff) plus uploaded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157619706764164/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dawn&#39;s Journey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her trip &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/05/sky-camp.html&quot;&gt;to Glastonbury&lt;/a&gt; and related destinations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a brief chat with a professor regarding the scene in Iran earlier today (she&#39;s also a gender and management consultant).  She&#39;s understandably disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3619912157/&quot;&gt;time to ride Tinkerbell&lt;/a&gt;, unclog a few pipes.  I&#39;m wearing my &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Star Trek&lt;/span&gt; T-shirt (Alexia&#39;s actually -- original cast), which should help me blend in (lots of Trekkies in this town, if you ever need to go under cover for some reason -- maybe go for that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3620260698/&quot;&gt;pointy ears look&lt;/a&gt;, or copy &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/star-trek-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Uhura&#39;s tattoo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No wait, senior moment, this is my&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt; Beatles&lt;/span&gt; T-shirt, a present from the Lott family.  Same advice:  blend in to Portland&#39;s happening music scene, pretend you&#39;re an aging rock star, or maybe a blues guy of some kind.  Leave the slide rule at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back from my ride...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On cue (cuz I&#39;m the dad), some kitchen sink parts failed, a long running battle, need a professional, but Uncle Sam has been kidnapped by scrooges who &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;make him fight&lt;/a&gt; to pay ransom, so I make do with duct tape.  These are serious problems though, if you live here.  But then I&#39;ve got it better than most &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/futurism-revisited.html&quot;&gt;Global U students&lt;/a&gt;, grossly under-served by an underpowered curriculum (not geeky enough, need &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/general-systems-theory.html&quot;&gt;more GST&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rich kids in the West Hills get their anglophone live-in tutors from the Philippines, probably know &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html&quot;&gt;Pythonic math&lt;/a&gt; already.  Working class types, just making ends meet, learn rickety old Newtonian stuff and maybe next to nothing about polyhedra (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/high-school-melodrama.html&quot;&gt;no MITEs even&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was talking with Lindsey &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/workflow.html&quot;&gt;at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Angelo&#39;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; awhile back, about ways to maybe fix that.  She was looking at Free Geek and a return to personal tutoring, after some years in the corporate sector.  I posted some &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/patient-tracking.html&quot;&gt;more thoughts on that&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, before turning to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/patient-tracking.html&quot;&gt;those hospitals&lt;/a&gt; again.  Giving up &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/pps-has-friends-in-silicon-forest.html&quot;&gt;on PPS&lt;/a&gt; is not part of the plan though, as I was emailing to Patrick (on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Jennifer 2&lt;/span&gt;, running &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hardy Heron&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David, who does systems for Lewis &amp;amp; Clark, confirms a fried bus or mobo is to blame for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/jackalope-down.html&quot;&gt;Jackalope&#39;s downing&lt;/a&gt; (not a software issue).  I&#39;ve got the carcass in a bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rose and Tara ended a fine Father&#39;s Day by cooking a take &#39;n bake pizza, while I wrote in Facebook about my role as freshman senator in a &quot;fledgling dictatorship&quot; i.e. Python Nation, and published a new web page on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeo.html&quot;&gt;Arthur Seigel&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pygeo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a plan I&#39;d mentioned to AR, one of our MVPs in said network).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom is enroute back from Pendle Hill, routing through Chicago.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8221803695309565421'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8221803695309565421'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/fathers-day.html' title='Father&#39;s Day'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3791700699295277874</id><published>2009-06-13T08:55:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-14T20:07:49.431-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Visual Proofs</title><content type='html'>We&#39;ve been enjoying &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1954438&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;more raucous debate&lt;/a&gt; at the Math Forum about whether we have &quot;visual proofs&quot; in mathematics.  This is a question for investigation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3620731814/&quot;&gt;ala Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt; into language games, not &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1954811&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;a knee-jerk response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, suppose we wanted to prove a tetrahedron is simpler than a cube. The skeptic says &quot;prove it!&quot; and we go into some counting procedure, pairing edges with ordinal numbers and showing the cube has twice as many, ergo is over-built for the purposes of enclosing volume. QED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the skeptic sees a lot of skulduggery in the above proof and will want to go back and &quot;define terms&quot; e.g. &quot;simpler&quot;. It&#39;s not fair if he loses, is the basic premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m certainly in favor of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/more-curriculum-cartoons.html&quot;&gt;using cartoons&lt;/a&gt; for the purposes of marshaling one&#39;s faculties, giving intuitive insights &quot;in a flash&quot; where that&#39;s doable. Satisfying mathematics &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=206&amp;amp;threadID=1952850&amp;amp;messageID=6746716#6746716&quot;&gt;includes gestalt switches&lt;/a&gt; of this kind. But that&#39;s not to say I&#39;m against plodding (pedantic) proofs where necessary. Sometimes you get a poky pony to ride, been there done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On behalf of the skeptic: oft times those swoopy flashy proofs bleep over key points, aren&#39;t truly open source in that you can&#39;t do them at home, more like legerdemain (sleight of hand), and really &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1955490&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;not truly proofs&lt;/a&gt; in that sense (more like clever hoaxes, spoof proofs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But remember: once arrived at, by whatever means,&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1954738&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt; a clever visual proof&lt;/a&gt; may be just what the doctor ordered and &quot;swoopy flashy&quot; is not necessarily a criticism in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By way of analogy, consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/reflective-fragment.html&quot;&gt;some of Ramanujan&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; astounding &quot;generator expressions&quot; (Pythonic namespace) -- the proof is in the pudding as they say (you&#39;ve got your decimal type, check it out), but does that mean we always know where he got &#39;em in the first place? Not really. A proof can be like that too (out of a hat).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3791700699295277874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3791700699295277874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/visual-proofs.html' title='Visual Proofs'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1356323486406041142</id><published>2009-06-11T08:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-12-17T23:32:08.552-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Recruiting Commercial</title><content type='html'>USA diplomats are getting creamed overseas, with the argument &quot;if you Americans had any brains, you&#39;d be out of Iraq by now&quot;.  Yes, that&#39;s hard to counter, especially after the Prime Minister&#39;s remark, that if we got to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/future-of-image.html&quot;&gt;those pictures&lt;/a&gt; that we all know are out there (on memory sticks a lot of &#39;em), then the fun in the sun would be over, and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/summer-marketing-campaign.html&quot;&gt;the army we&#39;ve got&lt;/a&gt;&quot; would have to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2011/12/20111218513415803.html&quot;&gt;vector home&lt;/a&gt; to the bone yard pronto, no ifs ands or buts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the thesis of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Why We Fight&lt;/span&gt; (movie)&lt;/a&gt; is that brainwashed Americans are unintelligible, have come to a point in their civilization where they no longer talk sense of any kind.  They talk about &quot;the economy&quot; a lot, as if their own militarism were on some other planet, long ago and far away.  &quot;Suffocatingly stupid&quot; would be my rejoinder, &quot;but we &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; have pockets...&quot; and then I trail off, looking hopeful (nod nod, nudge nudge (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ona-RhLfRfc&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;Monty Python skit&lt;/a&gt;)).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then we don&#39;t exactly come across as &quot;deep pockets&quot; over here.  Uncle Sam is broke, but spends what few dimes he has left continuing to lose reputation overseas, through repeated acts of public self humiliation.  I&#39;m not blaming the White House.  I&#39;ve always looked at radio and TV pundits as the source of our problems (asking questions was OK, but once journalists started &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/05/live-from-baghdad-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;having opinions&lt;/a&gt;, it was time to crank up the stereo and look elsewhere for mind control).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, this is hardly the future I was prepared for in school, so it takes some getting used to.  I&#39;ve noticed youth feel the same way I do, amazed and agog at what &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/summer-marketing-campaign.html&quot;&gt;old people&lt;/a&gt;&quot; are doing -- nothing sensible, that&#39;s for sure, unless you posit a death wish (which of course we do &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/with-friends-of-jung.html&quot;&gt;in Jungian psychology&lt;/a&gt;, so yeah it&#39;s called &quot;denial&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If Americans really wanted more and better life extension services, we&#39;d have those oncology cruise ships by now, like the Russians are building.  But you can&#39;t have adequate health care &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; commit to an ideology of &quot;kill at will&quot; whenever you don&#39;t understand the action.  &quot;Having it both ways&quot; (i.e. a healthy economy &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; a seriously diseased political climate, with no conservatism that&#39;s sane, no liberalism that&#39;s not spineless) is just too much the oxymoron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Medical science requires a civilization to sustain itself and we just don&#39;t seem to have all the food groups around here, though I&#39;m more hopeful about &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/forced-march.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; zip code areas&lt;/a&gt; (nudge nudge, wink wink).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that I&#39;m not blaming the war dead for this mess.  I&#39;ve been &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1953263&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;wailing on Bourbaki&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Math Forum&lt;/span&gt; again, haunted by that notion of &quot;looking busy&quot;.  Just remember:  if you&#39;re studying geometry and they say nothing &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/search?q=tetrahedron&quot;&gt;about tetrahedra&lt;/a&gt;, that&#39;s called &quot;Rome burning&quot;, and what your teacher is doing we call &quot;just fiddling around&quot; (looking busy, not really working, not employed in any useful capacity, &quot;checks for free&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/moneyfor.htm&quot;&gt;as &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dire Straits&lt;/span&gt; put it&lt;/a&gt; (OK, it&#39;s &quot;chicks for free&quot; I knew that)).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1356323486406041142'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1356323486406041142'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/recruiting-commercial.html' title='Recruiting Commercial'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-5555782671376446684</id><published>2009-06-10T05:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-19T15:34:32.642-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Wanderers 2009.6.10</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3614141861/&quot; title=&quot;Sheldon Renan by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3564/3614141861_00a75c37b0_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sheldon Renan&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan was to show up on time, given we had a guest presenter, but when I saw Katie Couric was doing a short on the history of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/10/duck-typing.html&quot;&gt;Donald Duck&lt;/a&gt; as a final news story, I had to linger and watch.  I had no official duties at Pauling House, in terms of set up, arrived the same time Barry did to find a full house, our speaker still on the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier in the day, I&#39;d had one of those &quot;you&#39;re breaking up&quot; conversations with Alaska regarding state standards, charters and such.  I took my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1952850&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;usual position&lt;/a&gt;, that if your state isn&#39;t doing anything around &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/posting-from-my-xo.html&quot;&gt;V + F = E + 2&lt;/a&gt;, using that to anchor the concept of &quot;dual (or reciprocal) polyhedra&quot; then you live in &quot;a loser state&quot;.  It&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/show-me-polyhedra.html&quot;&gt;an easy position&lt;/a&gt; for parents to understand, and a conservative one, as we have no business dropping polyhedra from geometry, a wisdom of the ages and basis for architecture and chemistry alike (we meet in the Linus Pauling House, so are especially aware that chemicals form &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2987035149/in/set-72157600254540815/&quot;&gt;polyvertexia&lt;/a&gt; or &quot;molecules&quot; as we call them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The talk, on Netness, by &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Sheldon&lt;/span&gt; Renan, was mostly about connectivity (interoperability) and Moore&#39;s Law.  This was one of those frustrating talks where you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re getting, if anything, until well after the fact.  The guy has a track record, reminded me &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/1-2-3-marketing.html&quot;&gt;of Paul Laffoley&lt;/a&gt; a little, in his accounts of heroics.  He talked about Xerox-Parc and Intel quite a bit, various geniuses he&#39;d known.  He also introduced us to an interestingly young entourage, &lt;a href=&quot;http://oakhazelnut.makerlab.com/thesis/&quot;&gt;a cyborg anthropologist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://bram.me/&quot;&gt;a typographer&lt;/a&gt;, who turned me on &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;amp;item_id=Gentium&quot;&gt;to Gentium&lt;/a&gt; (we also discussed &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/operations.html&quot;&gt;Akbar font&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent most my time standing, plus had airport chauffeur duty looming (really early today) so left with a new Wanderer for some quick discussion outside, where we could &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/out-riding.html&quot;&gt;raise our voices&lt;/a&gt;.  After lots of chatter, Don dismissed people to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Bagdad&lt;/span&gt; and our crowd dispersed.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3471303736/in/set-72157617170752129/&quot;&gt;Aldona&lt;/a&gt;

height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This is a political art film more than a strict documentary and unlike &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hearts and Minds&lt;/span&gt;, has a rather cluttered editorial track hitting on many levels, somewhat Nordic in flavor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is mostly by and about journalists in awe of their own technology, and maybe too confidant that getting footage to CNN or BBC is an end in itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The foreign journalists have a lot of empathy, but mostly say vacuous things, sounding a lot like George Bush, who also has a speaking role in this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting better technology into the hands of the monks &amp;amp; nuns, rather than having them be filmed by the students, would probably make more sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They need the Internet, or at least multiple intranets, and ongoing freedom to pursue a scholarly life of the mind.  From such study, good governance might arise, and better films, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/hp4e.html&quot;&gt;like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Cup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, you have a company town profiteering for northern neighbors, lots of thugs on payroll with families to feed, with so-called citizens an inconvenient overhead expense suffering from malign neglect, a grin and bear it, long drawn out, post Katrina scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#39;s a lot of the world for ya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company rules with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/01/beyond-rangoon-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;stylized intimidation&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes brutal and lethal, its chief counter to nonviolent street theater (&quot;the whole world is watching&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely an ugly situation ripe for overhaul, but are student journalists really the only natural born leaders?   And so what if there&#39;s a pipeline in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it how everyone nods knowingly at cocktail parties as soon as anyone says &quot;pipeline&quot;, as if we were all &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/animal-electricity.html&quot;&gt;oil tycoons&lt;/a&gt; on the Queen something or other, crossing the Atlantic over a hundred years ago and meaning to sound rich and worldly.  Blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s dear Aung San Suu Kyi of course, but superhero cults, like superpower politics, express an anemia, a deep deficiency, resulting in melodrama minus much in the way of true satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She much deserves an expenses paid vacation, her own talk show if she wants one, time to share and be with whatever people she chooses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention the pipeline came up later in discussion, as this was one of those special occasions in Fox Tower when we got some Q&amp;amp;A after (I was glad to get in the six miles walking to and from).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film itself is more like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;eXistenZ&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Half Life 2&lt;/span&gt; in constructing a surreal and oppressive reality, a fevered dream, a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monks need their own TV studios, and more festivals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My two cents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, I should mention I was in Rangoon a long time ago, came in on some DC-3 in a rainstorm, really bumpy, plus I was emailing about Chang Mai today (where some scenes in this film were reenacted) in connection with PSF business, so small world.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1574582621654145623'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1574582621654145623'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/burma-vj-movie-review.html' title='Burma VJ (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3620/3604903014_59e3d1fc08_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-2059579333495055777</id><published>2009-06-05T08:29:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-07T09:58:53.647-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Cooking Show</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m volunteering more time on the Home Economics classes I&#39;d like to see, in this case &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6740132&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;a cooking show&lt;/a&gt; for the school intranet, devoting plenty of focus to both energy and health issues i.e. energy comes in many forms and &quot;more salt&quot; isn&#39;t always what your batteries need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I expect to compete with other text book publishers and their lip service people?  In part by not competing with them, in not offering &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/saving-trees.html&quot;&gt;dead tree wood pulp&lt;/a&gt; as a primary distribution mechanism.  I push hardcopy costs to the end user, keeping the server side in a version controlled environment, quickly patchable when errors are found.  There&#39;s no waiting an eternity for the publisher to fix it in &quot;the next edition&quot; (if you&#39;re even &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; lucky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1949077&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cardinality vs. Ordinality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another important thread weaving through Supermarket Math.  You have all those products, but &quot;sorting by preference&quot; or even &quot;price&quot;, top-to-bottom, makes no sense.  Whose preferences are we talking about when no one samples every product in the store, plus what would it mean to compare apples to oranges (actually, there it makes sense, in that people may have strong preferences (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1949352&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;I like them both&lt;/a&gt;)).  Once you get into a single universal sort of some set, you&#39;re in an ordinal situation.  Rank in the military is often cited, but here again, we have several branches plus &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-wars-continued.html&quot;&gt;room at the top&lt;/a&gt; for many subspecies of civilian (in the USA model at least).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think your stereotypical geek wouldn&#39;t be thinking about health issues, as aren&#39;t geeks these &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/simpsons-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;overweight males&lt;/a&gt; who just sit and stare at screens all day, eat junk food with wild abandon, pay little attention to the physical plane (except maybe the one they&#39;re designing?).  I&#39;d say that&#39;s more the &quot;nerd&quot; stereotype whereas geeks tend to be lighter weight &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/outreach-to-japan.html&quot;&gt;Japanese&lt;/a&gt; (Korean...

The main purpose of the recordings was to serve season subscribers who couldn&#39;t make it in person, however, there&#39;s also a significant historical legacy represented in these hours of recordings before live audiences at the Schnitzer (usually) in Portland, Oregon.  Jane Goodall, Sir Roger Penrose, Carl Sagan, Jean-Michel Cousteau, Bob Ballard, Jill Tarter, Rebecca Goldstein, Lynn Margulis... lots on prehistory, dinosaurs, the future of the planet, Noah&#39;s Ark, religious perspectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this was mostly a shoestring operation with reasonably good equipment for the day.  Recordings of slides on a screen, minus any live feed from a projector, was pretty much state of the art in our time, nor is the Schnitzer a TV studio.  The &quot;big theater&quot; venue is a feature we&#39;re glad of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One proposal is to establish a practice of watching in small groups, minimum two, so there&#39;s real conversation even during the replay, the privilege you have when watching a recording (to talk over the talker), along with pause and rewind.  Take notes, circle high points, use definite time signatures if possible, and file somewhere, in a blog, Wiki... someplace searchable.

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3468997687/player/&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cursory readers get a lot of question marks going off as they read the computer stuff these days, as the technical writing has only gotten more technical, but that doesn&#39;t always mean less comprehensible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Engineering is about making sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you work on a web page, staging for purchase, that&#39;s private information until you hit a submit button, or should be.  Then a little suitcase gets stuffed full of data and sent through a portal, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/back-to-work.html&quot;&gt;watch &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Warriors of the Net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if confused about how our truck fleet does business (a packet delivery service).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What goes with that suitcase, like an airline baggage tag, is a URL.  In a modern framework, that might be filtered, like through charcoal (no, I&#39;m not drinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/returning-to-pdx.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Jack Daniels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the moment), to a &quot;view builder&quot; (like in Django), which will fish in the database per instructions, then prepare the fish (perhaps smoking it), for sending back down the pipe, an HttpResponse object, another suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, these are all metaphors.  We&#39;re talking bits and bytes, as usual, but something more colorful is more likely to stick, n&#39;est pas?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Preparing the fish&quot; (or &quot;dressing it&quot;) is what templating is all about (using a template language, lots of boilerplate HTML, CSS, scripting).  You should imagine yourself sharing this service with random anonymous others, all hoping for a responsive web service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A web framework is a lot like short order cook, taking tickets on a big wheel, a public display of our queue (customers like the transparency, though once on the other side of the counter, it gets more parallel with the orders, plus who knows which staff are out sick or whatever -- thank you for your patience).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, I haven&#39;t talked about SQL yet, nor MapReduce.  That&#39;s all about the &quot;go fishing&quot; instructions, which may get processed through an ORM.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An ORM is an Object Relational Mapper, takes the scattered data from &quot;the bone yard&quot; (related tables) and reconstitutes a real case history, a once living and breathing human being, leaving valuable clinical data to medical researchers.  An ORM is also a two-way street in mapping new patient data back to these registries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s one application of Postgres or Oracle or DB2 or any other reliable SQL engine you may have heard about and/or used.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/open-source-database.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These engines&lt;/a&gt; may not be considered especially sexy or glamorous to work on perhaps, but they&#39;re still important work horses of our way of life, on so many levels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We should teach more about the SQL ecosystem in the high schools, with the MVC math that goes with it (also group theory, along with the J notion of &quot;rank&quot; or &quot;dimension&quot; -- a bridge to polytopes down the road).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve got this &quot;how it works&quot; explanation storyboarded with more Monty Python like visuals (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/mapping-gnu-math.html&quot;&gt;castle, knights&lt;/a&gt;) in other chapters, with less focus on the suitcases and/or &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/09/responding-to-critics.html&quot;&gt;TCP/IP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, I so far haven&#39;t explained how your hit against some server might unleash quite &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/admiring-javascript.html&quot;&gt;the JavaScript controller&lt;/a&gt; (like a puppet master, dominates the DOM), ready to take over client-side, we hope in a nice way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&#39;ve ever fought tooth and nail with your browser, and lost, chances are you were up against malware.  More dangerous yet is to download actual executables masquerading as &quot;just in time&quot; helpers, after delivering bad news (e.g. &quot;you&#39;ve been infected, download this now!&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/cyber-attack.html&quot;&gt;Spam and scam artists&lt;/a&gt; know their psychology, so take care, study up on file permissions, learn how to scan for open ports and so forth.  We touched on some of this with &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/pybiz.html&quot;&gt;HPD&lt;/a&gt; (a class we taught), hoping the schools would take notice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it that too few CTOs have a mandate &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/science-and-public-policy.html&quot;&gt;to share their knowledge&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As town-gown relations improve, so too will our level of security against all of these malicious cyber-threats.  The Internet is a fun place to play, but you need some real training.  Join us on the new digital math track maybe, in overlap with gym.&lt;br /&gt;

This practice is typically carried out in corporate settings, under the supervision of managers schooled in these techniques.  How often one switches partners and what the various workstations get tasked with doing, is part of the &quot;secret sauce&quot; one needn&#39;t share with the world in any detail, yet may package for training purposes, or for TV documentaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pair programming practice has maybe morphed somewhat given the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/ppug-2009512.html&quot;&gt;DVCS-based approach&lt;/a&gt;:  let everyone watch the whole show, including test off-shoots, then use social networking tools to agree on and tag release versions, to resolve merge and branch issues, to harness the synergies.  It&#39;s obviously not either/or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How this business world milieu influenced the curriculum was in helping to spread this practice of &quot;pair teaching&quot;.  Having math and history teachers work as a team, as co-workers, sharing the floor, modeling peer-to-peer behaviors, was considered unusual at the time of this writing.  The prevailing template was &quot;one teacher, many children&quot;, not our contemporary &quot;minimum two&quot; standard.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6901847240582445164'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6901847240582445164'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/pair-teaching.html' title='Pair Teaching'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-6054954323825342123</id><published>2009-05-22T15:46:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-05-22T18:08:10.562-07:00</updated><title type='text'>USB to Kill CubeSpace?</title><content type='html'>Much as PPS is wanting &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/pps-to-kill-lep-high.html&quot;&gt;to discontinue LEP High&lt;/a&gt;, which put Portland on the map as a city where big dreams come true, so is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;US Bank&lt;/span&gt; wanting to destroy its own reputation for thinking outside the box, which it briefly had &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/portland/2009-May/000706.html&quot;&gt;when investing in Cubespace&lt;/a&gt;, a place for Portland&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/pdxjs/msg/aec5d207dba4cd91&quot;&gt;most computer savvy&lt;/a&gt; to be productive.

NASA is pretty good at media, although the Russians got a lot of bang for the buck just by hosting visionaries, making orbiting in zero-G a great sport (more democratic, less state controlling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, the space program has always understood about media, theme parks, museums -- keep the public in the loop (pretty simple strategy, works wonders, take a page &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/fast-food-nation.html&quot;&gt;from Madison Avenue&lt;/a&gt; why not?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-Ti1GrF8MGt3ee0vnzGy_oxaCKp9L0JajJeTtNv7LTCiWAdA7uSGEcdsukoYjM2lhTf2LkMpMteEOgFeMC27cSvVxbsg2az57VrdkbeuStO3S0qK4jmyUTjVlamc1mHDccm0f/s1600-h/missinglink_res.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 150px; height: 60px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-Ti1GrF8MGt3ee0vnzGy_oxaCKp9L0JajJeTtNv7LTCiWAdA7uSGEcdsukoYjM2lhTf2LkMpMteEOgFeMC27cSvVxbsg2az57VrdkbeuStO3S0qK4jmyUTjVlamc1mHDccm0f/s320/missinglink_res.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5337941883800259010&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8541512381757899376'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8541512381757899376'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/wanderers-2009520.html' title='Wanderers 2009.5.20'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgPHwmyZhv2RIP2qQ-NSAjJbx_7oCxNvJW3_ep-VVZe9qVSOgcR5z8EAU6WVjFmgNqxYeBFPAXkS-ZSWz01obsJir9LEmr3I5820fX3xm47o4twaYBpoBngDnRUjsbbEHWiLLbO/s72-c/izzy.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-5862002885812842360</id><published>2009-05-17T14:22:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-04T18:33:25.301-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Weekend Haps</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

LH, a phys ed chief, back from NIH gig in DC, met up with some top regional talent re shunting CRRs back to HQS for &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/gis-2009.html&quot;&gt;GIS services&lt;/a&gt; etc.  Mapping diabetes two correlated with fast food establishment density will prove revealing I bet, in service of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/slow-food-nation.html&quot;&gt;medical science&lt;/a&gt;.  Thx for update re Tacoma, Women&#39;s Rights museum, buying lunch for chauffeur.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Left her &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/11/fast-food-nation-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;for review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/design-scientist-ron-resch.html&quot;&gt;RR&lt;/a&gt; sent half gig easter egg PDF flipbook, while my one free sample got turned into &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-May/009351.html&quot;&gt;some glorious Python&lt;/a&gt; by GL, our Viennese turtle keeper.  Ron is an effing genius I&#39;m thinking.  Glenn and I hope to support PPS with first dibs and sneak peeks on a lotta stuff, ISEPP willing (he&#39;s an ISEPP senior fellow, also &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;CSN CSO&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CHR did a 3-day training in inter-cultural competence, can never have too much of that I agree.  Sent her CCs of my Sociality writings for analysis (or not).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fine Grind&lt;/span&gt; kicked off a new art show, continuing proud traditions.  Our CFO picked the right team.  Andrew&#39;s gear statues (which Tara adores) front and center, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/storyboarding-tomorrow.html&quot;&gt;Andrew&lt;/a&gt; himself off to Spain for a spell (looking forward to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/travel-bar.html&quot;&gt;travelogue&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eating ice cream today, celebrating making it to 51 (lots of up hill). Been shooting around my 14 mile loop on Tinkerbell some, aiming for 52.

No, these were rather the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/charlie-wilsons-war-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;heroes against Soviet expansionism&lt;/a&gt;, then called majahadeen and/or freedom fighters, their fundamentalism overlooked as not a key issue in that election campaign (don&#39;t they have a right to religious freedom? -- the USSR is totalitarian and says no, so we must fight them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their fanaticism &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; the core issue now though i.e. they&#39;re not supposed to hate the USA on penalty of death, and the Swat Valley looks like some &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/erratum.html&quot;&gt;giant Mormon compound&lt;/a&gt;, full of abused orphans in need of rescuing by remotely controlled drones (from some bunker in Texas?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; way from seeking &quot;the bearded one&quot; in some concrete bunker (like Saddam had), a rather exhausting enterprise plus never &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/iron-mountain-revisted.html&quot;&gt;a big employer&lt;/a&gt;, unlikely to pay many bills.  The Brits took one look at playing &quot;man hunt&quot; in that terrain and got out, long ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But speakers of Washington DC&#39;s brand of legalese (a dialect of punditry) are getting imaginative again, threatening to bomb this or that population &quot;into the Stone Age&quot; because hey, these people might be some kind of threat maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s more than a little hypocrisy in this position, but if you put on your &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/public-debate.html&quot;&gt;Manifest Destiny helmet&lt;/a&gt; (to go with the mirror sunglasses), then all that nasty &quot;thinking about it&quot; magically goes away.

Anyway, I usually don&#39;t get to know that much of the picture, at least not from their angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/presentations/p4t_notes.pdf&quot;&gt;distribute info&lt;/a&gt; (a two way trade), some say &quot;on the sly&quot; but I feel we&#39;re pretty up front about it (i.e. open source), we who teach &quot;the Gnu Math&quot; (as some call it, me included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, it&#39;s all about this game of &quot;BAT and Ball&quot;, an easy mnemonic, reminding of an all-American pass time. In this lesson plan activity, we equate the B, A and T modules (widgets, sliver shapes) in terms of volume, and relate them to our CCP ball of unit radius, a high frequency system (lets say &quot;porous&quot;), maybe spinning (to even out the bumpy bits).  Or lets picture a bowling ball, again all-American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/modules.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The B &amp;amp; A&lt;/a&gt; build a rhombic dodecahedron (RD) of volume 6 while the T builds a &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/product-placement.html&quot;&gt;rhombic triacontahedron&lt;/a&gt; (RT) of volume 5.  We&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1930851&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;using tetra-volumes&lt;/a&gt; of course, our right as an ethnicity (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/yar.html&quot;&gt;as buckaneers&lt;/a&gt; or whatever).  Each RD contains one unit radius ball, tangent to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/more-geometric-studies.html&quot;&gt;12 others&lt;/a&gt; at the diamond-face centered K-points (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/11/clocktet.html&quot;&gt;kissing points&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#39;ve been yakking about in review, is our phi/sqrt(2) radius for this other larger rhombic triacontahedron of K-mods (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPNhLpeK6-o&quot;&gt;in this namespace&lt;/a&gt;), the one that edge-wise criss-crosses the aforementioned volume 6 RD, although not as its dual (&quot;coworker&quot;

an amazingly good movie, just what the doctor ordered given I&#39;m swimming deep in the blues, thank you world and Friendly Care committee clerk (a death and dying professor, good with basket cases, this one about to turn 51).  This was my first time at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.livingroomtheaters.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Living Room Theaters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000518/&quot;&gt;John Malkovitch&lt;/a&gt; plays everyone&#39;s projection of the washed up extra, whom we all feel we&#39;ve seen a million times (on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/span&gt; probably).  His career is always just about over (or is over already) as he goes pay check to pay check, which he has to obtain through some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22quaker+discernment%22&quot;&gt;Friendly discernment process&lt;/a&gt; the audience isn&#39;t clear about, but enjoys watching nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young Hanks plays against his father.  He&#39;s following his heart&#39;s desires in being Buck&#39;s sidekick, instead of finishing law school (I&#39;d say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1289434/&quot;&gt;Blunt&lt;/a&gt; is proof he&#39;s on the right track), telling people he&#39;s &quot;a writer&quot;, which hit home for me as that&#39;s what I was telling &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/art-fine-grind.html&quot;&gt;Keiko&lt;/a&gt; about myself the other day too (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2932227543/in/set-72157607921813044/&quot;&gt;Russ&lt;/a&gt;, she&#39;s from Brazil, speaks Japanese (Russ more Chinese)) -- probably thinking of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/07/connecting-dots.html&quot;&gt;my &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Connecting the Dots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; paper &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/slow-food-nation.html&quot;&gt;for Vilnius&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004988/&quot;&gt;this Hanks guy&lt;/a&gt; is in a successful movie with his famous dad, me watching, and I&#39;m not even booked on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Letterman&lt;/span&gt; yet (I&#39;d have no idea what to say, something funny we&#39;d hope).  So yeah, I&#39;m jealous, even being a mentalist looks pretty good (yummy cash), I should get one of those ear mics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When cruel Las Vegas cuts out the corny parts, the act goes to hell. Buck is  happiest in Bakersfield, where he can sing about love on his upright piano.  I felt good about that because lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/whats-urner.html&quot;&gt;Urners&lt;/a&gt; live in Bakersfeld (just check the listings), bet those were some of my relatives in the audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s irony in our back stage talents wanting to know if the Great Buck is really gay, with the answer being &quot;we don&#39;t know, he&#39;s never with anybody&quot;.  He does embrace &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.georgetakei.com/&quot;&gt;George Takei&lt;/a&gt; though (played by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001786/&quot;&gt;himself&lt;/a&gt;), but then who wouldn&#39;t (everybody loves Sulu, me included).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The punch line of this film is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Great Buck Howard&lt;/span&gt; is based on the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Amazing Kreskin&lt;/span&gt;, whom I used to watch on TV as well, and we still don&#39;t really know how &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;he&lt;/span&gt; did it either.

When&lt;br /&gt;&gt; the edge length of the tetrahedrons&lt;br /&gt;&gt; is two the volume of the tetrahedron&lt;br /&gt;&gt; is eight times more, so you multiply&lt;br /&gt;&gt; cubical-volume by Sqrt[72]/8 =&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Sqrt[9/8] = 3/(2*Sqrt[2]).&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Cliff Nelson&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hammering together an XYZ &lt;-&gt; IVM bridge for two-way travel, Fuller began where he often began, with 4 &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/techie-toons.html&quot;&gt;CCP&lt;/a&gt; balls (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/ivm.html&quot;&gt;IVM &quot;spheres&quot;&lt;/a&gt;) in inter-tangency, forming the 6-edged simplex of edges 2 PVR i.e. twice the prime vector radius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is home base or unit volume in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/span&gt;, so then the next question is how to relate it back to XYZ training you might have gotten in high school. Given Cartesians love to fill space with cubes and fixate on rectilinear as &quot;normal&quot;, we should just do the usual and intersect our home base tetrahedron with its own dual, thereby supplying the 8 points to hang a cube frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The geometry to prove this cube has volume 3, given the opening tetrahedron had volume 1, is really easy, is sometimes done as an animation (per &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics Folio&lt;/span&gt; and/or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/plates/figs/plate03.html&quot;&gt;color posters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics2&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#39;s the Cartesian, staring at this sculpture, four tuned in balls, two tetrahedra, a cube. Given he knows the balls are unit radius (that&#39;s a given), it occurs to him that the cube&#39;s face diagonals are all edge length two (given they interconnect the centers of adjacent IVM spheres). This is one sphere diameter or one interval (0 Frequency), but it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/practicing-multiculturalism.html&quot;&gt;also unity-2&lt;/a&gt;, so go with the 2 why not? Using Pythagorean Theorem, that gives edges of sqrt(2) and that to the 3rd power would be the sought-for volume, ergo sqrt(2)**3. So, if my toMAHto is 3 and your toMAYto is sqrt(2)**3 (or vice versa), then now we have the basis for&lt;br /&gt;converting any polyhedron at all. Your volume will be a little smaller. Fuller liked &#39;em kinda close (easy on the memory -- &quot;we rule, but only by a tad&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where this sqrt(72) comes from in the original two volumes I have no idea, but I&#39;m guessing this is something from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/name-collisions.html&quot;&gt;your &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics Coordinates&lt;/span&gt; contraption&lt;/a&gt;, which lives elsewhere in the literature (e.g. on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MathWorld&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/span&gt;, though that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/span&gt; page needs a champion -- you were rather critical of it in this archive, no one else seems to know what it means).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirby&lt;/cjnelson9@...&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3505487428/&quot; title=&quot;Colorful Cover by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3537/3505487428_70a9d199b7_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Colorful Cover&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;new from &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/quadpod.html&quot;&gt;Hop David&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4045469707642831525'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4045469707642831525'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/yakking-trekkies.html' title='Yakking Trekkies'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3537/3505487428_70a9d199b7_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-6801002111947516869</id><published>2009-05-06T06:25:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-05-08T08:58:10.233-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Workflow</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi270PDAMyqJEXR5l7fzbIqYzTE31OxcnG0rQRzXhQSaEJka_1UWR0Fx5nIldNgfcuRLpSd-kEoDva0ApKKpNYi3CHbOUa-3uIFpA6MEgPA-oDJXqXyu0hlJ5hLThGSZ-mc-DHa/s1600-h/00001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi270PDAMyqJEXR5l7fzbIqYzTE31OxcnG0rQRzXhQSaEJka_1UWR0Fx5nIldNgfcuRLpSd-kEoDva0ApKKpNYi3CHbOUa-3uIFpA6MEgPA-oDJXqXyu0hlJ5hLThGSZ-mc-DHa/s320/00001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5332756423720234482&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: lindsey ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsey, Patrick and I were yakking at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Angelo&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; about this and that geeky topic, Patrick being generous with the beers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsey, a fresh face in Portland, shared her perception that FOSS (free and open source software) has meant &quot;unsupported&quot; in much of corporate America, or, as I&#39;d sketch it:  somebody&#39;s brother in law writes a custom application and then vanishes, what next?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the tools were free, the barrier to entry was low, but now company X is left holding the bag.  This happens in the nonprofit sector all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s not really a FOSS issue though, as we had the same phenomenon when the tools were not free.  The client either paid for the tools, or more likely the developer paid for a development environment, like Visual Studio, and the client had some runtime abilities, maybe with no source code whatsoever.  If the brother in law vanished in this case, the situation would be more dire still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#39;s an important application with a long life span, you&#39;ll want continuity in personnel, even if individuals pass the baton and move on, meaning you&#39;ll want a bevy of developers (people tasked with developing), version control, and well documented source code.  A company isn&#39;t expecting too much in wanting this for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was also schooled to promote self sufficiency and independence in the nonprofit sector, so the best solution of all involved training up geeks in-house, getting the application supported internally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you just need to outsource the initial design and first iteration, accomplished in tandem with developers, but then tweaking, enhancements, or even coding a whole derivative application (i.e. rather similar to the first one), becomes part of the job description of in-house personnel (&quot;in-house&quot; might include working off site on occasion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, so-called &quot;end users&quot; liked Microsoft Access because they could add fields to the database and tweak the screens to show them.  You didn&#39;t need to rely on some remote authority to make these little changes.  Microsoft Access allowed for more autonomy (which sometimes meant a big mess, live and learn).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Access doesn&#39;t scale well as a multi-user application on the server.  Microsoft would prefer you use SQL Server for that, with Access a client maybe, although these days a preferred client is the web browser itself.  But once the application is on the server, what happens to all that autonomy?  Aren&#39;t you at the very least now at the mercy of the IT department?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are workflow issues, less than software issues.  It&#39;s true there&#39;s no FOSS tool quite like Access, or at least &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rekallrevealed.org/&quot;&gt;Rekall&lt;/a&gt; and the database features in OpenOffice don&#39;t seem quite the same thing.  But when it comes to server side applications serving out through an intranet (i.e. not &quot;world facing&quot;), FOSS shines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What doesn&#39;t shine in many cases is the ability of in-house personnel to control their own destiny, with software tools of any kind, open or closed.  From their point of view, it might just as well all be closed, because &quot;source code&quot; is just gobbledygook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per Guido&#39;s CP4E (Computer Programming for Everybody), a core goal is to demystify the code base to where company X is empowered to maintain more of its own applications, because the source is all there, along with the documentation and people who know how to tweak it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If cube farmer Y is one of the five people tasked with database schemas (say some relational system in Postgres), and finds a job with a different company, then she trains her replacement and moves on.  The company still has five people trained in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course not every small business is big enough to put five people on anything.  Nevertheless, if the developers demystify as they go, supply training and source code, plus serve as professional hand-holders if there&#39;s a serious overhaul in the cards, not just small fixes, then the resulting in-house culture will enjoy more autonomy and self-sufficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a field needs to be added, a template changed, even a sole proprietor might make those changes, between manning a cash register and baking scones in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bringing out your inner geek, training her, feeding her, could be a goal of some of your educational experiences.  Offer to become your employer&#39;s point person in working with developers and suggest to your CTO or other manager that in-house autonomy, which requires access to source code, is a cost saving measure in many cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course many developers are snickering in their sleeves around now because they know their gnarly C++ or Java application is just way too complicated for any end user to enhance or debug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their job security depends on their being professional coders and their giant closed source application is for authorized personnel only, and that means clients will need a support contract and will just need to get in line for service.  If the client ventures to make changes, that voids the support contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, many clients don&#39;t realize how a simpler solution might actually fit the bill, how sometimes you just need a different tool set or a different set of developers more willing to empower client companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#39;re a company, shop around.  Don&#39;t just assume you need to outsource indefinitely and think twice before investing heavily in source code you&#39;ll never get to see or modify, especially if you&#39;re Uncle Sam.  If the public is funding your project, FOSS is the way to go, if you&#39;re serious about leveraging the net benefits (i.e. really serving said public).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my &quot;empower the client&quot; philosophy, you might see why I come off as such a fiend around overhauling math teaching.  We need students to eyeball more source code, write more of it themselves.  As a nation, we shouldn&#39;t be outsourcing everything.  I see this as an opportunity to get real, pass on a lot of skills people actually need.

But then there&#39;s &quot;pooper scooper&quot; and so &quot;scoop&quot; in a more negative sense, as in nasty tabloids, obnoxious hissy fits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above, I&#39;m scooping with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Picassa&lt;/span&gt; and syndicating through Google.  It only took a few seconds.  Blogs all over the world have little embedded LCDs, channeling Bucky geometry, potentially speaking.  We were &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.billboardsource.com/products.php&quot;&gt;checking billboard prices&lt;/a&gt;, thinking about Iceland maybe (for algebra, not just geometry).  Yes, they cost a lot (side of a bus, airport concourse... taxi teepee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, the idea of a &quot;one man newsroom&quot;, so ridiculous to contemplate much above the level of &quot;pamphleteer&quot; until recently (or some nun with a mimeograph machine, trying to get us to care &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/dignity-village.html&quot;&gt;about homeless&lt;/a&gt;), is by now the reality, with lots of &quot;one man show&quot; blogonauts having followings (circulations) that rival small rags, certainly compete with major columnists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#39;t need your &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/span&gt; or your &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Newsweek&lt;/span&gt; to be a George Will anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same is coming for television if it&#39;s not already here, and who can deny this is that &quot;democratization within the media&quot; we&#39;ve long espoused in the name of equity, at least at the lip service level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who woulda thunk it that tireless engineers took our requests seriously, and now we&#39;ve got what we wished for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus the great thing about the Internet is it&#39;s more a pull than a push, so you can&#39;t so easily blow a gasket when you see the wrong stuff.  There&#39;s an implied &quot;you asked for it&quot; in the very concept of httpRequest.  Of course if it&#39;s assigned reading or homework, maybe you&#39;ll need to drop the class?  Talk to your professor?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not to excuse abusive Javascripts however, or scam sites that prey on the defenseless in ways that excite our justice system to action, so yeah, the FBI loves to play cybersleuth, has better tools than most noobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sites get shut down every day, especially if making false health claims that&#39;re dangerous to believe.  Interpol looks for that too, as the international trade in placebos or worse is a booming business.  So if you&#39;re claiming science is on your side, better have some ducks in a row when your peers come a-knocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of which, that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/first-day.html&quot;&gt;opening episode of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mad Men&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is hilarious: &quot;We can&#39;t claim cigarettes are good for you anymore, we&#39;ve hit a dead end&quot;; &quot;How about telling people they have a death wish so live it up?&quot; (psychology still new kid on the block); so better:  &quot;lets just tell &#39;em some nonsense that makes &#39;em feel better and they&#39;ll buy&quot;.  And the rest is history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m bullish about editing and filtering (e.g. mathcasts) as I think that&#39;s where the action is, especially in curriculum writing (one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/more-curriculum-writing.html&quot;&gt;my specialties&lt;/a&gt; -- I do a kick ass kind of math movie, sometimes just &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/mapping-gnu-math.html&quot;&gt;storyboards&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s no shortage of content; people are being generous, and the infrastructure is just getting more and more reliable.  Derek has the latest &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Studio&lt;/span&gt; (based on Jackalope), phoned me from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fine Grind&lt;/span&gt; to let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have any number of Pentiums to reconfigure (even some Duo Core), should we choose to go that route.  I haven&#39;t talked to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Free Geek&lt;/span&gt; lately.  Toaster farms:  every school needs an Intranet, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/high-school-melodrama.html&quot;&gt;storing school plays&lt;/a&gt; (MPEGs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/school-spirit.html&quot;&gt;that trusty school intranet&lt;/a&gt;: a growing repository of place-based information, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/gis-2009.html&quot;&gt;GIS resources&lt;/a&gt;, student blogs, archived threads.  This is what those &quot;gnu math teachers&quot; will help you set up and administer (could be your same teachers, on a learning curve with the rest of us).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because you acquire some sysop skills in high school doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re committing to a nerdy existence in some windowless cubicle.  Even small villages in France with plenty of fresh air could use a sysop or two, plus you&#39;ll have other day jobs as well (thinking of the new face of IB).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/198285200011326879'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/198285200011326879'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/scoop-and-syndicate.html' title='Scoop and Syndicate'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-6055082058320389196</id><published>2009-05-01T21:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-05-01T22:22:31.906-07:00</updated><title type='text'>X-Men Origins: Wolverine (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/k2CFDsG_oxg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/k2CFDsG_oxg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;  style=&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;The Architect by deus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Without rehashing plot details, let me just point out the perennial nature of this story line, of children with secret gifts, getting sucked in to government experiments, with clueless generals at the top.  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes, it&#39;s a &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Marvel&lt;/span&gt; comic.  What did you expect?&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You get a similar plot in &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/incredibles-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;The Incredible&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/incredibles-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;s&lt;/a&gt; though, and in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/span&gt;, with muggles versus the outcasts, the geeks like Hermione or whatever.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yes, it&#39;s an old story.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So then I get home from the movie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3492609273/&quot;&gt;at Pioneer Place&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/positive-developments.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Nick&lt;/a&gt; reminds me of &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Architect&lt;/span&gt; by a group called &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;deus&lt;/span&gt;.  Why not revisit and work that in?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I call this the &quot;slow superman&quot; telling of Bucky&#39;s story, in that he goes into some privacy booth, then comes out with a plan (a solution), but it takes him like a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;whole year&lt;/span&gt; to get changed.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lots can change in a year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;X-Men&lt;/span&gt; saga is a long one and this is a prequel.  I saw another part on an airplane &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/10/our-big-new-york-adventure.html&quot;&gt;that time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And hey, I&#39;m not saying kids &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;aren&#39;t&lt;/span&gt; secretly gifted or that government programs &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;don&#39;t&lt;/span&gt; secretly exist.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/cywar-in-cyberia.html&quot;&gt;Geeks&lt;/a&gt; like this genre for a reason, way more than &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Revenge of the Nerds&lt;/span&gt; say.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How I explained it to Kirk Petersen (old Princeton friend) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3493362690/&quot;&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;:  Weird Al &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;makes fun of&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp6eswhgOKk&quot;&gt;nerds&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9rfGP7Xe2w&quot;&gt;a geek&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6055082058320389196'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6055082058320389196'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/x-men-origins-wolverine-movie-review.html' title='X-Men Origins: Wolverine (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
