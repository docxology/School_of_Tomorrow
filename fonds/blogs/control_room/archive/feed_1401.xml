It&#39;s quite a hike from where 14 leaves me, to Cramer in PSU, but Portland is a smallish town, and I wasn&#39;t lugging speakers, nor even a laptop this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our main focus today was a somewhat exhaustive investigation into a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-May/008562.html&quot;&gt;simple game framework&lt;/a&gt; I put together since last week, after gauging  student interests and abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The emphasis here is on building a reading familiarity with core Python such that slower paced tutorials will already come with some context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://showmedo.com/&quot;&gt;Showmedo&lt;/a&gt; and watched some of Jeff Rush&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://showmedo.com/videos/series?name=CnluURUTV&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Intro to IPython&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.diveintopython.org/toc/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dive Into Python&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and of course the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/doc/&quot;&gt;Python docs&lt;/a&gt; themselves, to prepare them for self-study at whatever rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also continued underlining the fact that Python comes in several flavors, including a proprietary version atop Nokia hardware or whatever, all in accordance with its liberal license.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&quot;&gt;IronPython&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jython.org/Project/index.html&quot;&gt;Jython&lt;/a&gt; implement the language in C# and Java respectively.  Stay tuned for more options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also explained how I use Python in my own case professionally, sometimes to study the &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2137134480771470882&quot;&gt;geometry of geodesics&lt;/a&gt;, per &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/stickworks.html&quot;&gt;stickworks.py&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/polyhedra.py&quot;&gt;polyhedra.py&lt;/a&gt; -- my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html&quot;&gt;4dsolutions.net stuff&lt;/a&gt; will remain at their disposal, as adventures continue.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2604550546620851611'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2604550546620851611'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/sa-classnotes-2008510.html' title='SA: Classnotes 2008.5.10'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3837990714788161292</id><published>2008-05-07T10:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-07T13:23:25.150-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Teacher Training</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;[ first posted to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergeo&lt;/span&gt; #39693 ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the idea is to run these like summer camps and/or inservice trainings for teachers wanting to have the right stuff, based on both state of the art standards and popular stereotypes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/04/hackerdom.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hackerteen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and such, kids expect induction into the mysteries of the Internet rather early, so if you&#39;re not talking IP numbers in grade school (nothing to do with intellectual property -- namespace collision), that might mean you&#39;re in one of those pre-21st century institutions (more like prison -- do they block Youtube even for teachers? a telling sign).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The private sector, somewhat in competition with the military, is hungry for students who actually know something about how the world works, information not liberally shared in most workaday schools, where the old management philosophy was to train &#39;em for factory jobs or other rank and file occupations, with college not the default (those were called prep schools). Of course nowadays everyone expects college, but with high tuition that&#39;s still not really normative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/regarding-lockharts-lament.html&quot;&gt;today&#39;s blog post&lt;/a&gt;, we in the Silicon Forest (there&#39;s that we again), are chomping at the bit to revamp the K-12 experience such that it&#39;s more up to date as to the mix of skills it teaches, even as we stick to many classical topics, such as trig, some calc, stats, and metrology (the art of measuring). Geography ties it all together on some level, in that we always start with the spheroidal planet, zoom in on applications of interest. Google Earth plays a big role, other KH-derived services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What teachers get selected for such training? I&#39;m thinking the military will try to set up a pipeline for some of its own teacher-trainers, but this won&#39;t preclude collaboration at the federal level, as there&#39;s tax money involved either way and traditionally the private sector is allowed to synergize (make a profit) by field testing and/or guinea pigging in that area. However, I&#39;m thinking the military mission will become more like what NGOs already tackle daily, in terms of disasters, with the violence quotient far lower, given its inappropriateness as a reflex (earlier / recent threads). That&#39;s why &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/meeting-for-business.html&quot;&gt;as a Quaker&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m not so bent out of shape about all the cold war baggage we&#39;re inheriting as next generation Fuller Schoolers. Cold war means psychological, and we Quakers don&#39;t preach against so-called &quot;inward weapons&quot; only outward, i.e. jihad, in its less uncoordinated (awkward) sense, is ok, has many parallels even in Buddhism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The military and civilian spheres have long overlapped in medicine, where the job of physicians is to tend to wounds, however inflicted (in whatever theater). The direct relevance of open source engineering principles (a form of design science -- plus we&#39;ve already had more than a decade of it), to healing the wounded, doing medical things, is just starting to become obvious. The old legal system, which had no concept of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/legally-free.html&quot;&gt;legally free&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (as in &quot;criminal to be selfish with&quot;), had less to offer good doctors than the spanking new legal system of today, which owes a lot to the engineering community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greater Portland, hailed by &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Christian Science Monitor &lt;/span&gt;as an open source capital, is well positioned to pioneer in this area between biochemistry, electrical engineering, genetic science, and front lines medicine. We&#39;re not that dependent on the traditional military economy, which is mostly a junk recycling business these days. That frees us to think outside of that box, and we&#39;re doing it. The education system is adapting pretty quickly I&#39;d say. Looking forward to the Bucky play in October. Stay tuned.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3837990714788161292'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3837990714788161292'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/teacher-training.html' title='Teacher Training'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4860008956607720193</id><published>2008-05-05T23:40:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2015-10-12T11:49:10.659-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Animal Electricity</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;

Then we checked out the Cinco de Mayo scene on the waterfront, rode the ferris wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to Julian for the heads up on this Pauling Legacy Award Lecture.  Oregon State has been giving out this award biannually since 2001, for outstanding work in areas related to Linus Pauling&#39;s research in chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
MacKinnon, like Pauling, is an X-ray crystallographer looking at molecules, albeit bigger and more complicated ones, such as these ion channels within the cell membrane, devices for releasing positive charge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was telling Tara on the way over that a good study technique, often better than taking notes &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;during&lt;/span&gt; a lecture, is to just listen with rapt attention and do a recall shortly there&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;after&lt;/span&gt;. I learned this technique from my Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics course in the Philippines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tiny &quot;ion pumps&quot; chug away in the background, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/10/more-tales-of-cell.html&quot;&gt;fired by ATP&lt;/a&gt;, keeping all those cell membranes charged up like capacitors. A lot of calories go into keeping up that electrical tension.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The mechanical discharge of potassium ions, through these various types of channel, variously  activated, is like a &quot;wave&quot; in a football stadium, where people progressively stand up and sit down, causing a ripple along the nerve or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The storytelling was very intelligible and historical, tracing the evolution of our understanding of electricity through a lot of big names, Ben Franklin&#39;s included.&lt;/div&gt;

We also looked at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pygame.org/&quot;&gt;Pygame&lt;/a&gt; a little, but both have a steep learning curve, so best to already know Python.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also toured Sourceforge a little, talking about how geeks collaborate on new code, share projects.  That&#39;s not really the focus of this course however.  Perhaps one day soon, Saturday Academy will offer classes on CVS, Mercurial, Bazaar... on Apache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many topics, so few Saturdays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython&quot;&gt;IronPython&lt;/a&gt; 2.0 beta 2 is out today.

about neighboring Iran supplying weapons to the Iraqis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do we suppose Washington, DC could stop Texas from supplying guns to Canada, were the Russians to invade our neighbor to the north?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nationalism being what it is, the Iraqis will keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/03/troop-rotation.html&quot;&gt;fighting the occupation&lt;/a&gt; for as long as it takes, that much is obvious.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/05/geodesic-mosques.html&quot;&gt;Tehran&lt;/a&gt; has limited ability to stop the flood of weapons, given how easy these are to procure in a world market already flooded with ammo-for-profit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American people, mostly hostage to all this miscalculated belligerence, and not getting the low gas prices they&#39;d hoped for when the war was being sold to them, are now being threatened with a massive conflagration by these inept military commanders, trained to suppose there&#39;s a military solution to every problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hopes the Pentagon is not completely in charge of foreign policy, as obviously we have some very unimaginative thinkers in that building -- sad for the USA to have to put up with this crew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hopes the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/war-college-philosophy.html&quot;&gt;war colleges&lt;/a&gt; are turning out a more sophisticated crop of military leaders, one that doesn&#39;t get itself stuck in future quagmires of this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The president tried to wrap it up with that &quot;mission accomplished&quot; extravaganza, an obligatory show of macho (isn&#39;t that what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/mycartoons/cartoon2.html&quot;&gt;politicians&lt;/a&gt; do, strut on stage?) after a relatively short blitz. Saddam and his cronies were captured long ago.  These were the graceful exit points, ignored by those at the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#39;s the mission today?  No one seems to know.  The Pentagon has no fresh ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the election make a difference?  Some tyrants are hoping to have their next war going already, so they can keep calling the shots.  Democracy and the will of the people take a back seat when there&#39;s a war on, a fact many &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/bomb-guantanamo.html&quot;&gt;Pentagon planners&lt;/a&gt; instinctively know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the upcoming Olympics will get people in a better mood?  Athletes in general are a more competent bunch, not resorting to violence at the drop of a hat, yet still very competitive and patriotic, far more of a showcase for what civilization is all about.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2370277336831464876'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2370277336831464876'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/pentagon-policies.html' title='Pentagon Policies'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoTh9qD_UlddDo4VRRlMO2QG9gL6TjhZuRYB6di-XgIvkbPrLbbuvGPlwdn8AgWwcOQaZw2GqL6n8q1-s73JJ9i-wz89e29WLclX1KvNSXUEK1SDnBfGptq0FtDPl_0qC_0JrO/s72-c/newsvid.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-5421857010289764318</id><published>2008-04-28T09:39:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-04-17T11:30:09.979-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Calculus Mountain</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Those of you who&#39;ve heard me inveigh against Calculus Mountain, such as in the YouTube above, will maybe think I&#39;m anti-calculus or think it shouldn&#39;t be taught.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For one thing, teaching calculus was my bread and butter out of Princeton, my first job with a BA in philosophy (Rorty my thesis advisor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/philosophy-101.html&quot;&gt;Kaufmann&lt;/a&gt; one of my referrals to Erhard&#39;s philo, which I studied on the side, in tandem with &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/wittgenstein-again.html&quot;&gt;Wittgenstein&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; with Victor Preller et al, some grad work at St. Peter&#39;s in Jersey City, making the transition to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-April/008525.html&quot;&gt;Dominican run school&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But also, I&#39;m in agreement with many in the Physics First and First Person Physics movements, that calculus, having grown up in the context of Newtonian mechanics, has a natural context within physics, so we should use that in K-12, with &quot;pure calculus&quot; (minus any physics application) left for some later time, for those college majors electing such degree paths.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We currently waste way too much time on calculus in high school, in some faddish, almost occult desire to equate this subset of math concepts with the whole shebang.  Strong candidate alternatives are already in field testing, with promising results.  The USA is not monolithic and there will be no &quot;one size fits all&quot; replacement, so don&#39;t expect big headlines regarding some big switchover.  That occurred years ago, as a part of the rise of digital over analog technologies more generally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember, the steam engine reached its pinnacle in sophistication long after the writing on the wall had already appeared, spelling diesel (now it spells a lot of other things).  Calculus as currently configured is already well past its pull date, but still hangs in there, bless its little heart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And again, I&#39;m not for a purge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m for physics getting a better toehold, chemistry too, both united &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/brainstorming-about-pedagogy.html&quot;&gt;in biology&lt;/a&gt;, and have no problem with relaying Newtonian mechanics in a somewhat classical form, abetted with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/04/plotting-with-vpython.html&quot;&gt;VPython&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3849910741753677908&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;YouTubes&lt;/a&gt; and so on (plus maybe real visits to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/09/powells-on-hawthorne.html&quot;&gt;roller coaster parks&lt;/a&gt;, if we do our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/04/more-first-person-physics.html&quot;&gt;FPP curriculum&lt;/a&gt;).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5421857010289764318'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5421857010289764318'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/calculus-mountain.html' title='Calculus Mountain'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4951570579245235910</id><published>2008-04-26T13:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-12-04T12:24:25.003-08:00</updated><title type='text'>SA: ClassNotes 2008.4.26</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

The parking went more smoothly, plus the weather was good, got Ubuntu Dell and better speakers in harness no problem, with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CodeGuardian&lt;/span&gt; queued.  However, without support from the home team, I&#39;d&#39;ve been leaning on staff too hard, having left my logins chart on my desk or someplace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We worked pretty hard today, through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/viztoyz.py&quot;&gt;viztoyz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/povtoyz.py&quot;&gt;povtoyz&lt;/a&gt;, which take the real time versus render time approaches respectively.  The former uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vpython.org/&quot;&gt;VPython&lt;/a&gt;, the latter &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.povray.org/&quot;&gt;POV-Ray&lt;/a&gt;.  The point of showing a movie like &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6087974730400799810&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CodeGuardian&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is how such a small team now has these powerful tools, but you also need to really sit at the feet of great directors, to pick up on small touches like camera jitter, a way to help viewers join the action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Fibonacci generator, designed for phi convergence (which worked eventually), got off on the wrong foot, as 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... yields my sequence 1/0, 1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5...  So I got bitten by two gotchas:  divide by zero and default integer division (this is Python 2.5).  Fortunately, easy fixes were at hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was able to show &lt;a href=&quot;http://osgarden.appspot.com/about.html&quot;&gt;my &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;I Ching&lt;/span&gt; source code&lt;/a&gt; in a font that renders the characters readably, back to explaining the ASCII to Unicode migration, also part of this 2.x to 3.x transition.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4951570579245235910'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4951570579245235910'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/sa-classnotes-2008426.html' title='SA: ClassNotes 2008.4.26'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1874271282525142234</id><published>2008-04-22T21:28:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-22T09:32:15.265-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Erratum</title><content type='html'>I hadn&#39;t properly tuned in the fact that Texas, not Arizona, is the state engaged in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/repost-from-newsgroups.html&quot;&gt;shameful and cowardly attack&lt;/a&gt; on an American community, however unusual and perhaps distasteful to others its anthropological structure (I&#39;m not saying I&#39;d join in this lifestyle, but this isn&#39;t about me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently, it&#39;s looking like the call instigating the raid might have been a hoax, but never mind, families are being destroyed, government DNA testing enforced, all in the name of &quot;preventing child abuse&quot; -- laughable, and sad.

in particular (this was in part owing to having no logins at first, staff scurrying to secure them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/08/dutch-masters.html&quot;&gt;Dutch master&lt;/a&gt; might&#39;ve known to put in those Venetian blind reflections or whatever, in ray tracing we just combine geometry and optics and let the computer figure the consequences, meaning the artist is as excited as anyone to see what comes out the other end, maybe after a long night of rendering (if doing animation especially -- many frames).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also imported &quot;star&quot; (meaning everything) from &lt;a href=&quot;http://vpython.org/&quot;&gt;visual&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; visual &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(255, 102, 0);&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; *) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ginning+up&quot;&gt;ginned up&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vpython.org/webdoc/visual/sphere.html&quot;&gt;gray ball&lt;/a&gt; -- kinda boring but good foreshadowing for what&#39;s coming, plus shows how core Python plus the Standard Library plus 3rd Party stuff (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html&quot;&gt;including mine&lt;/a&gt;) makes for a generously endowed math learning environment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re using &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/idle-dev&quot;&gt;IDLE&lt;/a&gt; on Windows in a university computer lab -- and yes, I clued them about the Monty Python connection (e.g. Eric Idle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small class, about six, the way we like it in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pymath.html&quot;&gt;Saturday Academy&lt;/a&gt;

We knew this had always been a tension, so why make it a public spectacle now of all times? Wasn&#39;t there a smarter way to handle this? Maybe there&#39;ll be less of a hero attitude in future interventions of this kind?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to know, not my department.  I bet the FBI is abuzz with water cooler chatter about it all, given echoes of Waco (so far this is way way less ugly, but still ugly enough).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1139849157868975915'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1139849157868975915'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/repost-from-newsgroups.html' title='Reposting from Newsgroups'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgbx2dN3pPPJb7gntHPB6TK8jfK354TVKMIpkVB43bbQkcFsWLVsKLfU6U4NImVMf6xzbar-JF9J7DRaY4J4VPXwfLVryEekM5qkmHdSP1YZQfFagzpIRf6lPeVL5DOMWIj1MW3/s72-c/crackdown.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-6218162605725597375</id><published>2008-04-15T14:17:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-15T15:56:49.516-07:00</updated><title type='text'>There Will Be Blood (movie review)</title><content type='html'>This contemporary &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/80th-academy-awards.html&quot;&gt;award winner&lt;/a&gt; (Daniel Day-Lewis for best actor, also best cinematography) surprised me with its bold sound track, and long opening with no dialog, which reminded me of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/span&gt;, right down to the shaft and old dynamite:  welcome to another hell of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the dialog begins, it&#39;s still about the music of it all, the power of communication.  Some of the loudest drumming signals the onset of deafness, a pivotal scene as now the boy is beyond the reach of that fatherly, mellifluous, soothing, and controlling voice, in his own world for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unheeded warnings, danger signs, people in grotesque aspects:  all very disturbingly psychotic, with the only religion in the picture even more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The game between &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/name/nm0000358/&quot;&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/name/nm0200452/&quot;&gt;Eli&lt;/a&gt; becomes one of mutual humiliation, each poking holes in the other&#39;s story and self image, letting the sense bleed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#39;re mirror images in many ways, challenging one another&#39;s integrity and authenticity as competing patriarchs, both full of misanthropy and self-loathing.  The specter of false brotherhood haunts the subplot as well, which likewise ends badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand why this picture is celebrated, although it leaves me mumbling prayers for greater happiness among sentient beings, we humans included.

The user would have to hit reload, or the Javascript would trigger it, and a new page would appear, some matrix reloaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward and Microsoft comes out with this ActiveX control that allows developers back door access to the browser&#39;s experience.  Without making any obvious click noises, or otherwise distracting the user, the browser could update a server regarding user-triggered events, key strokes and so on.  Of course such tools could be used to nefarious ends, and to this day we have controversies surrounding browser security and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, other browsers quickly rallied around the XMLhttpResponse object (hence Web 2.0), which does what it says it does.  The client stuffs XML up the pipe, or just asks for new data, with XML coming back, to be deployed within the DOM somewhere, thereby giving the user an updated view, minus any need to reload or click or do other than emulate a control panel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, in throwing the I Ching, an HTML button  or embedded timer loop might trigger a fetch, sending nothing except this &quot;need a new throw&quot; signal.  The server comes back with some appropriate yadda yadda, which transcribes to the screen, pulling &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/iching.py&quot;&gt;Chinese characters&lt;/a&gt; from whatever font library supporting the unicode codespace (or some other addressing scheme -- the purpose of the DOCTYPE declaration).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those of you who already know all of the above often use the word &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/07/ajax-tutorial.html&quot;&gt;AJAX&lt;/a&gt;, focusing on the asynchronous nature of the Javascripted events (plus the AX might remind us of humble ActiveX beginnings).  Servers have lots on their minds and can&#39;t be guaranteed to have instantaneous response times (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/tcpip-for-gnubees.html&quot;&gt;tcp/ip&lt;/a&gt; itself doesn&#39;t guarantee it), so what happens on the client side, versus the server side, is only loosely coupled.  The response object signals when it&#39;s ready, has some new content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing some more searching if wanting more details on this subject, as it has been written up in depth by many competent AJAX developers and technical writers.  I&#39;m just supplying some overview, value added for those readers enjoying my spin on stuff.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/902865275344202715'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/902865275344202715'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/embedded-controls.html' title='Embedded Controls'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-7855446001569638695</id><published>2008-04-08T19:30:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-08T20:07:34.048-07:00</updated><title type='text'>PPUG 2008.4.8</title><content type='html'>We&#39;re getting briefed on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/FrontPage&quot;&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt;, an old fashioned looking high contrast CRT style front end to the Python interpreter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;re some gotchas plus the pager screwed up a few times, but I get the feeling our Intel guy is pretty happy with it, having done a really thorough evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m no IPython guru, so it&#39;s news to me, all these automagical functions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About fourteen of us?

Popular board games suggest where we might start.  We know what &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&amp;amp;q=monopoly&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Monopoly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks like.  How would &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Democracy&lt;/span&gt; look?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My standard example in &lt;a href=&quot;http://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/dev/Week-of-Mon-20080331/000014.html&quot;&gt;these meetings&lt;/a&gt; is to suggest two icons, say a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/teepee&amp;amp;r=67&quot;&gt;teepee&lt;/a&gt; and a fish.  I&#39;m supportive of local NavAm casinos in part because of profits they put into restoring &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/nehalem-watershed-wanderers-meeting.html&quot;&gt;salmon habitats&lt;/a&gt;, which makes for a healthier environment overall (plus I like eating salmon).  So these icons are now linked in my own world view, a memespace or namespace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do others wire up their icons I wonder?  This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democracylab.org/&quot;&gt;democracy lab&lt;/a&gt; would help us study intellectual currents, provide us with summary views.  Of course the Web already does this, plus the private sector spends big bucks on polls and surveys.  A goal here would be to make such information more available to the general public, not just to paying customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust and transparency would be key to the success of such a system, but in and of themselves would not be enough.  Robust designs will be essential.  To that end, we&#39;ll need to grow our team, ideally testing some competing prototypes before settling on best of breed (and even then, the improvements will be ongoing).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2184201056591742624'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2184201056591742624'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/experiments-in-democracy.html' title='Experiments in Democracy'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-8219183134067386623</id><published>2008-03-30T14:41:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-05-01T17:29:39.829-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Troop Rotation</title><content type='html'>The endless conveyor belt between the burbs and Baghdad, taking enlisted both ways, leaves many Americans wondering when and/or how it will end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The substance of what gets conveyed is especially critical, in terms of livingry versus killingry, as Bucky would put it.  To the extent &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/02/proposal-baghdad-grid-monitor.html&quot;&gt;living standards&lt;/a&gt; deteriorate, serving in a militia, however decaled and branded, becomes the only remaining option, the very definition of poverty in much of the world today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given both sides in Iraq see an end to the foreign military occupation as a common goal, what divides them is more a push versus persuade strategy.  The more militant factions want to push, whereas the more established party prefers to believe that a deescalation of violence, already accomplished, will prompt a voluntary withdrawal in response to political pressures back home (not much sign of that happening, which bolsters the militants&#39; view).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the civilian front, most of the action is behind the scenes, but with the cooperation of various supranationals, it&#39;s becoming easier to bid on reconstructive, post-war projects, not just in Iraq, but throughout the Middle East.  Whether the US Army Corps of Engineers gets a piece of the action, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2007-11/2007-11-30-voa2.cfm?CFID=219681727&quot;&gt;stabilizing that dam&lt;/a&gt; for example, remains unclear, at least to this analyst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly there&#39;s nothing stopping a formerly enlisted engineer from returning to the scene in a civilian capacity, as has happened &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/04/biz-page.html&quot;&gt;in Vietnam&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath.  Civilian energy projects need trained personnel, this hasn&#39;t changed.  Whether the home office is in Belgium or Birmingham matters less than an understanding of the scene on the ground.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8219183134067386623'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8219183134067386623'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/03/troop-rotation.html' title='Troop Rotation'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3010853008846066809</id><published>2008-03-29T15:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-15T02:36:05.397-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Disambiguation</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl6iGmjrpsnqlkPOVpQWP73-oykq6oxHXSvSxOh4BVaH3krZAJNj3fVNhqgJ0jzBgZMtYssdRoeqo50L-q3vFlcPxdUevq3xK5A_pIBZVMTHOI79oOvnJrhWh_7524hbcn1guH/s1600-h/disambiguation_sm.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgl6iGmjrpsnqlkPOVpQWP73-oykq6oxHXSvSxOh4BVaH3krZAJNj3fVNhqgJ0jzBgZMtYssdRoeqo50L-q3vFlcPxdUevq3xK5A_pIBZVMTHOI79oOvnJrhWh_7524hbcn1guH/s320/disambiguation_sm.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5183285440450787442&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;cuisinart vs. cuisenaire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A cardinal function of numeric, alpha and alphanumeric strings, is to tell one thing from another, meaning &quot;to disambiguate&quot; among them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#39;t always as easy as it sounds, as very different things may nevertheless share the same or similar names, plus we have those fine distinctions among subtypes, breeds or brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The word &quot;dog&quot; doesn&#39;t begin to do justice to the many &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/chronicles-of-narnia-lww-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;varieties of dog&lt;/a&gt; out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider for example, the box of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisenaire_rods&quot;&gt;Cuisenaire rods&lt;/a&gt; shown above, named for the Belgian math teacher who first thought them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many old timers remember these toyz from math class, where they were supposed to link length and number, forming a primitive geometric bridge to an algebraic sensibility.

I notice in my Chicago talk (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/03/my-talk-in-chicago.html&quot;&gt;link posted&lt;/a&gt;) that I employ a familiar trope or two e.g. kids beg me to not send them back to their traditionalist context (which is true), plus I employ standard divide and conquer strategies vs. the states, singling out the smart ones by litmus test (do they teach Euclid&#39;s Method for finding the GCD?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m also very typically a salesman (vendor), trash talking calculators because of my HP flatscreens or whatever they are.  I&#39;m clearly competing for public dollars, just as you suspect (no shame in being a defense contractor, if it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/temple-to-athena.html&quot;&gt;really defense&lt;/a&gt; that you&#39;re peddling (vs. some mindless manifest destiny imperialism of the prehistoric knuckle dragging &quot;American century&quot; type (a political embarrassment, worthy of spoof))).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus I think schools are underfunded, as we need more video/audio editing equipment and electric ATVs, not just Mindstorms Lego and Cuisenaire bricks.  More field trips to Antarctica also on the drawing boards, an opportunity not just for the rich and privileged.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/public-schools-overseas.html&quot;&gt;Overseas boarding schools&lt;/a&gt; also planned, public as in tax sponsored (i.e. you can apply from Peoria, for a year in Uruguay or whatever, with at least half the student body from the school&#39;s locale (international school model, but adapted to serve a broader domestic base, give more USAers pre-college overseas experience through a secular model i.e. not in the capacity of missionaries or NGO personnel)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirby</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/372288090458922461'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/372288090458922461'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/03/underfunded-schools.html' title='Underfunded Schools'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-8413831545501162126</id><published>2008-03-26T15:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-03-26T15:02:10.228-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Wanderers 2008.3.26</title><content type='html'>Ten of us sat around the big table having our typically meandering conversation about everything:  iPhone SDK, the remoteness of southern Oregon, the short attention span of children, three wheeled vehicles, brain function (I think brains are over-hyped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often take a rhetorically twisted position on issues of the day, balancing overly sane views with certifiable antitheses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/boosting-bandwidth.html&quot;&gt;short attention spans&lt;/a&gt;, yes they&#39;re adapted for TV and it&#39;s cruel to expect cold turkey kill your television behavior in scholarship; better to go with the flow and teach &quot;television editing&quot; (might just mean sequencing stills together over audio for YouTube, inside an affordable price point for public schools, provided they get sufficient vendor sponsorships (a form of product placement, advertising -- a competitive environment in working models)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, lets keep it up with the mathcasts on YouTube and Google Video, in supplement to whatever else is going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many threads broke out around the table for a spell, then converged to one conversation.
