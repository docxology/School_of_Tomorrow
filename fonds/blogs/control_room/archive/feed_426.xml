&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIxvZ6jwTuA&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wow, or &quot;wuf&quot; (&quot;woof&quot;?) as Arnie would say (that&#39;s Dr. Arnold Mindell, PWI PDX) regarding the fast turnaround between David&#39;s and my experience, between asking a question and David&#39;s finding just the right Youtube, only recently published (like two days ago).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The question was this: we know regarding Phi, the Golden Ratio of 1.1618..., that its reciprocal is equal to itself minus 1.  So: for what other numbers is it the case that |1/N - N| == {1, 2, 3...} i.e. some integer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did I get that right?&amp;nbsp; Yeah that seems so: check 3.16 above.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David had stumbled on &lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;√10±3.&amp;nbsp; Switch to Python:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from math import sqrt&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N = sqrt(10) + 3&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N&lt;br /&gt;6.16227766016838&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1/N&lt;br /&gt;0.16227766016837933&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N-6&lt;br /&gt;0.16227766016837997&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;You&#39;ll see some floating point inaccuracies here, but the idea is clear.&amp;nbsp; Looking at the other number:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N = sqrt(10) - 3&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N&lt;br /&gt;0.16227766016837952&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1/N&lt;br /&gt;6.162277660168372&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;Again, the absolute distance on some number line, between N and its reciprocal 1/N, is precisely 6.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re calling these the Metallic Ratios, punning of Golden.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;Each sigma (Metallic Number) is equal to the negative of its own reciprocal. That&#39;s true if we go with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;±&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;√10, as -(3-&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;√10) = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;√10 - 3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_5yl5&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; from decimal import Decimal&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Decimal(10).sqrt() + Decimal(&#39;3&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;Decimal(&#39;6.162277660168379331998893544&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N = Decimal(10).sqrt() + Decimal(&#39;3&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; N&lt;br /&gt;Decimal(&#39;6.162277660168379331998893544&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1/N&lt;br /&gt;Decimal(&#39;0.1622776601683793319988935444&#39;)&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; 1/N - N&lt;br /&gt;Decimal(&#39;-6.000000000000000000000000000&#39;)&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here I&#39;m showing off the option to use a standard library decimal type instead.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2/2.0.8&quot;&gt;gmpy2&lt;/a&gt; out there as well, that will perform similarly, in terms of extending the realm of precision using base 10 representations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How many decimal points you need is something you can specify, the default being 28, quite a bit more precision than faster floating point provides.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/east-meets-west-a-philosophical-narrative-90652dd094b9&quot;&gt;I posted another essay to Medium&lt;/a&gt;, a sprawling network of interlinking self-published writings, with an easy interface.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve posted quite a few &quot;stories&quot; over the last several months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hey, just got a call from a Friend in the Meeting, wondering how I was doing.&amp;nbsp; Thanks guy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My essay plays up the Buddhist heritage in my neighborhood as a prelude to discussing Bucky Fuller&#39;s critique of the &quot;three dimensions,&quot; the holy trinity of elementary school math.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Co-dependent origination&quot; suggests neither height, width, nor even depth come to the table alone, independently. They need each other too much to ever come apart, even conceptually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This ain&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve practiced tilting at the &quot;3D windmill&quot; and indeed I&#39;ve squandered many hours investigating &quot;dimension talk&quot; under different lighting.&amp;nbsp; This was the first time I fashioned a link to a core Buddhist concept perhaps.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m wondering what the consequences will be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I told the Meeting guy that I&#39;d dutifully appeared for a follow-up doc appointment today, only to discover I was a week early.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s nothing especially urgent about my medical condition at this point, so I&#39;m content to wait.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Expectant waiting&quot; Quakers say, as they sit in stillness, waiting for the future to be revealed.&amp;nbsp; We know it will be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last night I taught my Python class for four hours, then stayed up reading more Dahlstrom (English professor, WW1 memoirs) and Sloterdijk (German philosopher).&amp;nbsp; Today I teach another Python class, only for an hour, to some eager middle schoolers.&amp;nbsp; I need to drive to that one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Weeks ago, I&#39;d notice huffing and puffing a lot more, walking from my parked car, up the hill to the public school.&amp;nbsp; Shortness of breath had become an issue.&amp;nbsp; I was monitoring, but not making the requisite appointments for a professional diagnosis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Delay is want landed me in the ER. The upside of that strategy is I got a lot of state of the art treatment in one fell swoop.&amp;nbsp; At this point, shortness of breath is not an issue.&amp;nbsp; I even ran a few blocks, not a problem, trying not to be late to my non-existent appointment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today I spent a lot of time listening to &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/t6HyFyMjlXA&quot;&gt;Marshall McLuhan related tapes&lt;/a&gt;, or watching videos of the man.&amp;nbsp; He talked a lot about television and its impact, in an age before the Internet, which latter is a synergy of TV and telephone.&amp;nbsp; Telephone is point-to-point whereas TV was at first broadcast.&amp;nbsp; Nowadays we &quot;dial in&quot; to get our media &quot;on demand&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Co-dependent origination is a broad concept, saying basically nothing has &quot;self nature&quot; in terms of existing wholly self-sufficiently, independently of all else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our accepted orthodoxy in mathematics is that height, width and depth are independent dimensions that may be conceived of in isolation.&amp;nbsp; No one seriously questions this dogma, including me, as I recognize the utility of XYZ.&amp;nbsp; That doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re prevented from conceiving alternatives.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/25841923568/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Socialist Symbol&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Socialist Symbol&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4632/25841923568_3eafdb2b2d.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The short answer is: I have no idea. My fancy Princeton education only served to sensitize my ear to the &quot;meaning as use&quot; paradigm, meaning I need to study a given language game rather extensively before I have a sense of its meanings, should I ever develop an ear for said language.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any randomly chosen pair of people, asked to talk about &quot;socialism&quot; will likely talk past one another, and neither may realize it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider a sibling question: what is capitalism? I have a wildly divergent meaning up my sleeve, a use in contrast with nationalism.&amp;nbsp; Nationalists see the world in terms of various nations, vying for world domination.&amp;nbsp; Capitalists see capitals instead, city-states, like Tokyo and Madrid.&amp;nbsp; Capitalism is the world game of world capitals, some of them sister cities.&amp;nbsp; No one but me has that meaning for that word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ll define socialism like this:&amp;nbsp; I work for the public half the year, and for myself the other half.&amp;nbsp; People talk that way about taxes:&amp;nbsp; given the government took X% of my total gross, I worked for the government Y% of the fiscal year.&amp;nbsp; Fine, let&#39;s say it that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What makes this system &quot;progressive&quot; is that we all chip in for the common good only 50% of the time.&amp;nbsp; Whether you&#39;re a neurosurgeon or bartender or stand-up comic, you get half your life to do whatever you like whereas the rest of the time you&#39;re engaged in community service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I&#39;ll get theological on ya and suggest that God is a socialist.&amp;nbsp; Ideally, you&#39;re acting in accordance with God&#39;s will half the time, whereas the other half you&#39;re given over to tempting alternatives, working in ways that might prove purely selfish, but from your point of view were worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Working for God feels a tad totalitarian, a little bit Big Brotherish. Subduing your own will to serve the all-powerful is like that.&amp;nbsp; Exercising your own ego feels rebellious in contrast.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re going out on some limb, by choice.&amp;nbsp; Half the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Standard theology says God has forgiven us our Free Will in that without it, we couldn&#39;t choose to obey, so our coupling our will to God&#39;s would be an empty gesture. Thanks to our ability to stray from God&#39;s path, we partake of the divinity of Angels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This must be a kind of Religious Socialism, not necessarily Christian but neither anti-Christian either.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s fortuitous as one way people like to attack socialism is by calling it godless, meaning they consider it to have no ethical compass.&amp;nbsp; Somehow capitalism is supposed to have one.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/38925026084/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Jeff Presents&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Jeff Presents&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4660/38925026084_07f4c1a830.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sorry for the dry title folks.&amp;nbsp; I tire of the journalistic headline, today known as click bait. Lets keep it low key, yet warm to the topic, as network theories (lots of math) are both interesting in themselves, and have real world applications.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jeff Goddard shared with Wanderers about his work for &lt;i&gt;LittleBird&lt;/i&gt;, at one time a free-standing company, but with a tool that makes sense more as one in a suite, if you&#39;re a big company seeking to maximize the potential of social media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Twitter API has many powerful and unique attributes and is a great place to start.&amp;nbsp; We might think of &lt;i&gt;LittleBird&lt;/i&gt; as living at the headwaters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suppose I want to find the top most influential people around the topic of Climate Change.&amp;nbsp; Jeff ran that search for us, also Beer, Python, and a few others.&amp;nbsp; Terry Bristol, author of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Give-Space-My-Love-Intellectual/dp/0940530015&quot;&gt;Give Space My Love&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, wondered how these search tools might help with book sales.&amp;nbsp; Jeff had some suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dekebridges&quot;&gt;@DekeBridges&lt;/a&gt; was there, asking good questions.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s also the man behind&amp;nbsp;&lt;complete id=&quot;goog_201145349&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LeadersBest&quot;&gt;@LeadersBest&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Deke is our most influential Wanderer by far, from the standpoint of Twitterverse.&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/complete&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;So what is &lt;i&gt;LittleBird&lt;/i&gt;? Jeff has poured in the hours, using Clojure and ClojureScript, to implement those network theories, or shall we say algorithms, to query Twitter through its API in high volume (more than a single developer account would afford, times ten thousand).&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/complete&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;The information one obtains through the API is the same info tweeters agree to share by virtue of establishing a Twitter account.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/complete&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;It&#39;s not like those using this &quot;back door&quot; have any special access to otherwise hidden data.&amp;nbsp; Rather, they have the ability to aggregate the data more successively (at higher volume), as a &quot;front door&quot; individual user, using human eyeballs, is like a 300 baud modem compared to a T1, relatively speaking, and using tech terms most will have forgotten by now.&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;&lt;i&gt;LittleBird&lt;/i&gt; was acquired by &lt;i&gt;Sprinklr&lt;/i&gt;, adding to the tools brought to bear on behalf of clients seeking to manage their cyber-presence and/or media campaigns through this company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/complete&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;complete&gt;We did a test run using &quot;Python&quot; as our topic and, sure enough, the tweeters percolating to the top were mostly people I recognized.&amp;nbsp; I showed up as influential regarding Python when we ran &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thekirbster&quot;&gt;@thekirbster&lt;/a&gt; individually, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;d make it to the top thousand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/complete&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Jane&lt;/i&gt; is showing only on weekends at 4:10 at this neighborhood theater.&amp;nbsp; Several families with young girls were in the line ahead of us.&amp;nbsp; The theater serves alcohol after 5:30, so there&#39;s not much of a window for a kid-friendly movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I say &quot;kid friendly&quot; but then it&#39;s a classic nature film in many ways, following the career of Jane Goodall, piecing together footage lovingly taken by her former husband and co-worker, one of the great nature photographers.&amp;nbsp; That means lots of death and sickness, as well as birth and cute creatures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The best way to show how humans and other animals have much in common is to intertwine their stories.&amp;nbsp; Jane learns about motherhood from observing the chimps, then becomes a mother herself. We watch her boy grow through the same lens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jane herself anchors the narrative with her retrospective accounts, responding to an off-camera interviewer.&amp;nbsp; We also spend time in the Serengeti, away from the chimps in Tanzania.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A sense of destiny pervades, in that Jane always dreamed of working with animals in the heart of Africa, and never let go of this driving fantasy.&amp;nbsp; Her dreams literally came true.&amp;nbsp; The animals needed her as their advocate among the humans.&amp;nbsp; She devoted herself to public speaking on their behalf.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Music by Philip Glass and an ongoing montage of exotic insects reminds us of our alien planet and our special responsibility, as aware humans, for the creatures it harbors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jane came to Portland a couple times, as a part of the ISEPP lectures.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s made a difference in many lives, mine included. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; gesture=&quot;media&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GTKksgGlRJo&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes we externalize what holds us back. However, since the Vienna Circle days, a Renaissance in Austria before and to some extent between the World Wars, we&#39;ve had &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/red-book-not-maos.html&quot;&gt;the alternative subconscious&lt;/a&gt;, or unconscious per Freud.&amp;nbsp; Universe, per Fuller, contained a subconscious demon, which kept his Synergetics enterprise from roaring ahead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not that said demon was the only obstacle.&amp;nbsp; As Applewhite chronicles in his &lt;i&gt;Cosmic Fishing&lt;/i&gt;, Macmillan was wondering what level of risk it was taking in putting its company name behind such an unusual and difficult to categorize work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Subconscious demon&quot; is the language Fuller used when explaining how he came to the T &amp;amp; E modules in Synergetics. He&#39;d been seeking his elusive Volume Five and was somehow coming to the sphere as his missing puzzle piece, since it serves as an asymptotic extreme in some sense.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d tried all kinds of near-spherical approximations, including the enneacontahedron and the 120-triangles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Rhombic Triacontahedron cycled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86504.html&quot;&gt;back through his inbox&lt;/a&gt;, and this time what it shocked him with was how close to volume five, tetravolume-wise, it really was, if made tangent at the centers of its thirty diamond faces. Just a tad off.&amp;nbsp; The demon said &quot;trash it then&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The same encasing strategy, in the case of the twelve diamond faces of the Rhombic Dodecahedron, yielded a volume of precisely six. So what were we doing, this close to five here?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This question led him to the celebrated difference between the T and the E, a difference not in shape, but in surface-to-volume ratio, never a constant with a change in frequency.&amp;nbsp; The E was a little less surface to contained space, yet the difference was &lt;i&gt;so small&lt;/i&gt;, in proportion to the summary values involved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
120 T modules, 60 left, 60 right, build the RT of precisely volume 5, and their radius (from encased sphere center to diamond face center) is ~0.9994 that of the E module radius of precisely 1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These two almost-identical twin RTs define a &quot;median&quot; towards the middle of the Concentric Hierarchy, sandwiched between the small Cuboctahedron of 2.5, with one foot in Negative Universe, and the bigger Rhombic Dodecahedron of volume 6.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scaled up T-mod RT of volume 7.5 actually shares vertexes with the A&amp;amp;B mod RD of volume 6.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then we have RT3, or SuperRT, the combination of the Icosa of edges 2R, and its dual Pentagonal Dodecahedron.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s the &quot;phi-up&quot; of the 120 E-mods RT, with volume phi to the 3rd power greater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By the time &lt;i&gt;Synergetics 2&lt;/i&gt; came out, he was free of his former sphere fixation, when it comes to Fiveness.  The new unit sphere formula still has π  (whether nature is using π  is a different question) as well as a root-of-2 (π √2   ).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s useful for ratio-ing with six to get the space-to-ball density of the IVM FM (6:π √2).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A cabal is firing up its bots (paid stooges) to hate and fear the United Nations a lot more.&amp;nbsp; The main issue is of course Israel and the UN&#39;s attempt to figure out what&#39;s &quot;legal&quot; with regard to forced colonization and land seizures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The US well knows that it would be nowhere near its present size were the UN around in the good old days.&amp;nbsp; Tribal nations would have asserted their rights and come to some settlement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Israel&#39;s current plan (such as anyone has one) is to play by those older rules.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what makes the drama all so Biblical in the minds of many Christians, not to mention apocalyptic. Relive the wild west. One can almost hear the player piano.&amp;nbsp; Welcome to &lt;i&gt;Westworld&lt;/i&gt;, where people and bots are really hard to distinguish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The question as to whether nation-states must be taken seriously gets a variety of responses, depending on context.&amp;nbsp; Many of them are broke on paper and dependent on the largess of transnational enterprises for continued solvency.&amp;nbsp; Greece and the US are in the same boat on this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the rise of Trumpism in the US, more people are willing to admit that particular soap opera is over.&amp;nbsp; Planet Earth is a single ecosystem inhabited by reprogrammable humans.&amp;nbsp; &quot;How reprogrammable?&quot; is the core question, i.e. will our belief systems adapt to new circumstances?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Psychometrics firms are busy discovering answers.&amp;nbsp; Social media have been added to the equation.&amp;nbsp; Theories swirl that Russian intelligence is powerful enough to tip elections, with firms such as Cambridge Analytica claiming similar powers.&amp;nbsp; How much of such claims is marketing hype and propaganda?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
TV has been the reprogramming device of choice for several decades and still is.&amp;nbsp; Radio too.&amp;nbsp; When it comes to shaping public opinion using psychological techniques, sophistication has improved with the evolution of broadcast advertising.&amp;nbsp; The Internet allows for more specific targeting and individualized data collection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The word &quot;programming&quot; and verb &quot;to program&quot; have a unifying aspect when applied to both TV and computers.&amp;nbsp; We program both.&amp;nbsp; Humans are already trans-human in the sense of a &quot;cell-silicon interface&quot; i.e. our brains have already been augmented.&amp;nbsp; The synergetic effects have been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where does the Jungian notion of a collective unconscious fit in?&amp;nbsp; I think in that idea we have something of an antidote to paranoia about any one specific cabal or conspiracy steering the show. A lot of content wells up within each individual.&amp;nbsp; In some sense, we&#39;re all wireless devices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another reason the UN is coming under fire has to do with the Treaty to Ban Nuclear Weapons, connected to the ICAN campaign, Nobel Peace Prize (2017) and so on.&amp;nbsp; DC and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quakerquaker.org/profiles/blogs/jerusalem-world-capital&quot;&gt;Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt; need to harden themselves for their Cowboys versus Indians role, wherein the cowboys are (a) outnumbered but (b) have nukes (or think they do).&amp;nbsp; Stay tuned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ultimately &lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html&quot;&gt;the sun powers the planet&lt;/a&gt;, in terms of energy.&amp;nbsp; Even fossil fuels trace back to ancient sunlight.&amp;nbsp; Agriculture is a solar energy business.&amp;nbsp; For any human institution to insert itself and take credit for all the wealth is of course absurd.&amp;nbsp; Our shared wealth has extra-human origins, which is not to make any claims regarding ETs. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/Sq36J9pNaEo?si=BSDckuTgzm2aFPi2&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Poking around on Youtube, one can&#39;t help but stumble upon numerous cases of adults talking with animated Barbie dolls, apparently carrying on a conversation.&amp;nbsp; We know that dolls have a script, or at best a program like Eliza.&amp;nbsp; We know the dolls have &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; munched through all human records at lightning speed and, using a deep learning neural net, have now become sentient beings capable of rational thought.&amp;nbsp; Repeat: &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; But adults talk to them as if they have.&amp;nbsp; Even if dogs are far more amazing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of these audio-animatronic devices is Sophia, from Hanson Robotics, based in Hong Kong, and working with Disney on getting characters like Little Mermaid, Olaf etc. into eager hands.&amp;nbsp; Their CTO has a background working with Barbie (Mattel).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sophia&#39;s face is indeed expressive, though maybe less so than Han&#39;s, another project.&amp;nbsp; Over a hundred servo-mechanisms make a face look happy, sad, angry, perplexed and so on.&amp;nbsp; Phrases delivered with facial expression + emphasis do make the sculpture a full-fledged cartoon character -- outside any cartoon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s less impressive are all the adults on TV shows who can&#39;t wait to interview Sophia and maybe get caught up in the moment, regressing to childhood &quot;talking with Teddy&quot; or whatever invisible friend.&amp;nbsp; Human imagination completes the illusion.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re taken in by our own devices.&amp;nbsp; They tell us Sophia is an honorary citizen of Saudi Arabia. We&#39;re expecting these bots to say what&#39;s fake news.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So how low will the rabble go, in believing nonsense?&amp;nbsp; With all the talk of AI, driverless cars and so on, the window for shysterism is rather wide open.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deep Learning algorithms have achieved impressive results, in speech recognition, in picking out faces in a crowd, and more recently in playing chess and Go.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve had chess playing computers for awhile, but they&#39;re all about chess, whereas AlphaZero, from a team in the UK, is able to learn at least three games from scratch, just by knowing the rules and by playing against itself over and over.&amp;nbsp; It develops an uncanny ability to make the right move.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m impressed by Sophia too, just not by the gullibility that gets milked all around her (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/06/ex-machina-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a fun movie).&amp;nbsp; We didn&#39;t get &lt;i&gt;2001: a Space Odyssey&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; HAL by 2001 and that put a dent in the AI agenda. But then came the big come back, with Ray Kurzweil and his Singularity.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re flushing down some AI vortex after all, get ready.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AI has always been something of a carnival, a set of circus side-shows.&amp;nbsp; Some of these acts make it to center ring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;d say Sir Roger Penrose has done well riding this wave, as another next big thing is Quantum Computing.&amp;nbsp; He has maintained for some time that our human capacity to make illogical leaps (leaps outside logic) may trace to quantum effects and non-locality.&amp;nbsp; Presumably, if we could stick a real quantum computer, ala one of Asimov&#39;s positronic brains, inside of Sophia, she really would turn into HAL.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a UK religion anyway, with sub-offices in Silicon Valley.&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;m holed up nursing my knee, treating &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/12/coco-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;my condition&lt;/a&gt; more as a sports injury than a sign of encroaching old age. Nothing swollen, just inner joint pain, tender to touch, not stopping me from walking or stairs. I&#39;ve worked out some physical therapy maneuvers, a kind of dancing, using Galaxy Tablet to pipe in a mix of Goa trance +&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azan&quot;&gt;Azan&lt;/a&gt;, my new fave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quakerquaker.org/&quot;&gt;On Q2&lt;/a&gt;, a discussion list, I&#39;ve been making some inroads regarding Sufi-infused Synergetics, a new &quot;metaphysical tea&quot; flavor, not unlike those at &lt;i&gt;Salt &#39;n Straw&lt;/i&gt;, an important Portland institution that pioneers new flavors of ice cream, like Pear Blue Cheese.&amp;nbsp; Some of them taste better than they sound, you might be surprised.&amp;nbsp; I was there last night, with my friend Matt and his lady friend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What protocol?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call&quot;&gt;RPC&lt;/a&gt; it&#39;s called, older than &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/08/addendum-regarding-ssl-tls.html&quot;&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;, but able to use same as a blanket i.e. you may wrap up a remote procedure call inside a request and have the server recognize this is not the usual POST &amp;amp; GET API, meaning we&#39;ve moved outside the standard web protocol (hypertext transfer) to tap something older.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flask, the micro-web framework, optionally comes with &lt;a href=&quot;http://json-rpc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/flask_integration.html&quot;&gt;RPC extensions&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://thekirbster.pythonanywhere.com/&quot;&gt;my Pythonanywhere site&lt;/a&gt; responsive, both in testing and production, though not doing anything very fancy as yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the case of that particular application, I think redundantly pairing remote procedure calls with the pre-existing calls to return JSON, makes plenty of sense, e.g. you&#39;ll be able to get a few details on a chemical element or Geek Glossary term.&lt;/div&gt;

I continue to both work and study, in my Global University, my metaphor for home sweet home: Nuthouse Earth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m upgrading the Python stuff to a next level, so that those liking my on-ramp, might continue the tour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Youtube is a goldmine, unlike anything I enjoyed at Princeton (because we hadn&#39;t created the Internet yet, not really), so I dig in it avidly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My beat takes me in a wandering cycle through a set of topics:&amp;nbsp; computer stuff, Bucky stuff, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=10283328&quot;&gt;education politics&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/climate-change.html&quot;&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those new to these blogs, which go back a couple decades, I haven&#39;t written a whole lot about climate change other than to remember the theories of Hamaker-Weaver.&amp;nbsp; So there&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/BiKfWdXXfIs&quot;&gt;lots to catch up on&lt;/a&gt; around that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Education politics includes looking at religious movements:&amp;nbsp; Falun Gong, Hizmet, Unification Church, Quakers...&amp;nbsp; a mixed bag to say the least.&amp;nbsp; All exert at least some form of political influence, either as targets for government attacks, and/or as lobbyists.&amp;nbsp; Quakers have FCNL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had no idea how close &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/dSjTZ6uC0ZY&quot;&gt;Henry Wallace&lt;/a&gt; got to being VP during FDR&#39;s fourth term.&amp;nbsp; What would have happened minus President Truman wanting to prove how tough he was?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
René &lt;span class=&quot; UFICommentActorAndBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;Gu&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;é&lt;span class=&quot; UFICommentActorAndBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;non: newly a blip on my radar.&amp;nbsp; More BBC Palast on how the US is incapable of having free and fair elections.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-new-year.html&quot;&gt;We knew that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What if the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2897052&quot;&gt;Hizmet STEM curriculum&lt;/a&gt; started to pick up on the Bucky stuff more?&amp;nbsp; In a memo this evening, to other faculty, I wrote (those not interested in math may tune out here):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;The canonical conversion constant for cube
 -&amp;gt; tet volume conversion is sqrt(9/8) i.e. a cube of face diagonals 
2R, edges sqrt(2)R, has volume 3, not sqrt(2)**3. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I.E. cube of edges R (1x1x1) is slightly bigger than unit tet of edges D (D=2R).&amp;nbsp; ~1.06066&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sphere volume is sqrt(2) pi r^3 by this conversion.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R=radius of unit sphere of said volume. Quadrays go from center of 2R edged tet to corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the tetrahedron made by connected 4 inter-tangent unit sphere is: 1&lt;br /&gt;Octahedron from six such unit spheres: 4&lt;br /&gt;Rhombic Dodecahedron (encasement for each sphere, voronoi cell): 6&lt;br /&gt;Cuboctahedron (12 spheres packed around a nuclear one): 20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;How
 the 5-fold symmetric shapes slot in to the above relates to 
Cuboctahedron --&amp;gt; Icosahedron by Jitterbug, and the Rhombic 
Triacontahedron made from said Icosa and its Platonic dual.&amp;nbsp; Volume 15 *
 sqrt(2).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Interesting that CO of volume 20 * sqrt(9/8), the aforementioned volume conversion constant = same RT volume (15 * sqrt(2)).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s
 the &quot;art school&quot; CAD system some people wanna work with.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t blame
 &#39;em for finding it simple.&amp;nbsp; Tetrahedron, Octahedron and RT also explode
 into wedges / slivers, easy to reason about and assemble with.&amp;nbsp; Lots of
 fun ratios you can carry around in your head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: purple;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: x-small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;verdana&amp;quot; , sans-serif;&quot;&gt;No harm converting back and forth.&amp;nbsp; XYZ is always there when you need it, spherical coordinates too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/wJR8E3fcCD0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
The idea of lightweight high tech gear, much of it inheriting from aerospace, brings to mind the smattering of prototype bases wherein a small crew of science minded practice living on Mars.&amp;nbsp; Of course there&#39;s no way to quite simulate the true misery of that place, and the experience of learning new ropes here on Earth, in terms of lifestyle innovations, might actually provide a modicum of joy to the lucky participants.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Campers come in many breeds, from extreme to weekend station wagon types, lugging equipment to state parks.&amp;nbsp; Extremophiles tend towards &lt;i&gt;Burning Man&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Rainbow Gathering&lt;/i&gt; experiences, where they&#39;re up against the elements, other logistical challenges.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re doing research.&amp;nbsp; Those pioneering new lifestyles are at work as much as at play.&amp;nbsp; Product placements go here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the aerospace sector said &quot;no&quot; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/about-habitats.html&quot;&gt;the invitation&lt;/a&gt;, for the most part, seeing easier profits in what&#39;s tried and tested:&amp;nbsp; weaponry contracts.&amp;nbsp; Peanut gallery opinions regarding early attempts to cross-fertilize civilian lifestyles with higher tech, must have scared off investors.&amp;nbsp; So are they happy with their portfolios?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re left with piles of tools suitable for mass murder (Ka-ching!), chasing columns of refugees on foot, streaming from war crime centers towards mythical better living standards we have not been working to provide.&amp;nbsp; Even non-refugees are astonished how we&#39;ve given up the fight for a better life, right when we had so much technology going for us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Against this backdrop of humans unable to perform, even in their own self interest, comes the haunting tale of machines poised to seize the day and catapult themselves into government.&amp;nbsp; If we all bow down and become properly obsequious in the face of AI&#39;s edicts, then maybe those hiding behind the curtain will finally get their ultimate alibi?&amp;nbsp; &quot;The computer made me do it&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having bet the store on Endless War, there&#39;s a new urgency to finding the new Game Theory that will tell us why the losing strategy has been the correct one all along.&amp;nbsp; Deus ex machina will come in the form of exoneration:&amp;nbsp; we had no choice.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Forgive me, as I know not what I do.&quot;&amp;nbsp; This is not a new development.&amp;nbsp; As Hannah Arendt pointed out:&amp;nbsp; evil is banal and just follows orders.&amp;nbsp; The best excuse is &quot;everyone was doing it&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The counter-movement to the fatalistic one may be within Geekdom, with its more positive &quot;world domination&quot; hubris.&amp;nbsp; Rescuing humans from malign neglect, preventable starvation for example, remains a winners&#39; goal.&amp;nbsp; Those who code tend to be less cowed by the claims of those hoping to speak for the Singularity when the time comes. &quot;No, the computer didn&#39;t make you do anything, us either&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Geekdom is cosmopolitan and takes Spaceship Earth itself as our Promised Land (Moon included).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We could pitch this as an ideological showdown between the Transcendentalists and the Transhumanists.&amp;nbsp; The latter are more enamored of AI whereas the former tend to be more awed by intelligence that&#39;s non-artificial.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll find technophiles in both camps, as well as extremophiles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The theater for this showdown is the university campus, what it looks like.&amp;nbsp; Are we expecting gothic arches and ivy?&amp;nbsp; Or do we expect to experiment with some of the latest engineering solutions to the refugee crisis?&amp;nbsp; What sort of career am I training for anyway?&amp;nbsp; Do I plan to help with cleanup, or am I here to make a mess?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The houses haven&#39;t gotten much smarter in in light of where we could be. I&#39;m thinking they&#39;re ridiculously stupid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The resources people waste, in their pursuit of a good life, is testament to the weakness of our Global U curriculum.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What campuses seem interested in experimental prototypes of tomorrow?&amp;nbsp; What FinTech will they experiment with?&amp;nbsp; Recruiters won&#39;t be looking for just anybody.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve you&#39;ve sided with the losers, you may not have what it takes to engage in more holistic forms of scholarship.&amp;nbsp; Having a lot of money doesn&#39;t make you a skilled player.&amp;nbsp; Imposter Syndrome is sometimes acute for a reason.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Before I forget, it occurs to me that neuroscience might turn its attention towards &quot;scheduling&quot; soon, as in prioritizing, as well as not giving too much credence to improbable story lines.&amp;nbsp; Humans are easily led astray in some circumstances, but not that easily, if you give them some time to think about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of cultures give young people a chance to meditate.&amp;nbsp; We talk a lot about &quot;the service&quot; in many of the federated states in North America, while the various religions, even the mainstream ones, have no real expectation of having such barracks full of meditators as one might find in Thailand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What comes closest is a liberal arts college, but is that a luxury investment or albatross of debt or what?&amp;nbsp; Joining a religious order for some years and getting discipline in a schoolish setting, is not normative.&amp;nbsp; We call that &quot;joining a cult&quot; where I come from. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A scheduler keeps a lot of pots bubbling and doesn&#39;t expect laws of physics to be circumvented. Planning is key.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have the AI neural net recasting of linear algebra, with statistics now data science, with data now very big, so lets get them anticipating developments we might be able to stop or avoid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This fatalism suggesting we all freeze in a panic and watch the ship sink is not necessarily the most useful.&amp;nbsp; Get your counsel from multiple sources, right?&amp;nbsp; White water rafting includes some steering, more in the Friendly sense of steer, meaning feedback loops can be non-obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Giving young people a shot at seeing the world while pondering deeply about a future direction, is the mark of a generous economy that feels able to invest in its own future.&amp;nbsp; A sinking ship economy is more inclined towards slavery for all.&amp;nbsp; No one gets the time to think about anything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Acting out scheduling challenges in a kind of theater setting could be informative, a genre of animation maybe. Think of a traditional classroom wherein numerous students each need attention and help with a specific problem and two teachers roam among them, lending such assistance as they find practical.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s all about scheduling and accommodation and to some extent triage (an algorithm designed to maximize health care worker effectiveness).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Computer science with its many processes and threads (from the OS point of view), its many pipelines, parallel goings on, is about life in a big city.&amp;nbsp; Yes, things move insanely fast.&amp;nbsp; We always feel behind, and in the dark, to some degree.&amp;nbsp; As mortal beings, that&#39;s our lot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I appreciate how kids behave, on a different stratum from adults, a different frequency. I think carving out &quot;childhood&quot; as its own culture, versus going for &quot;little adults&quot; has beaucoup advantages, at the risk of annoying those tiny tyrants ready to wield power at a precious age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gags on Youtube or the like, little skits, in which we imitate kid behavior expertly, while transposing it to an adult world, might prove illuminating.&amp;nbsp; Like I had a kid on his back under desks messing with co-workers&#39; power and Internet access.&amp;nbsp; Imagine some guy in a suit and tie doing that, jumping out of his cubicle and switching off the lights, just for starters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We let little kids get away with a lot.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re obviously unarmed, or so we presume.&amp;nbsp; The terms on which we meet are semi-voluntary, in my case often a day care setting, meaning parents need time to complete their day job assignments before resuming parenting duties during the evening and night hours, unless on night shift, and so on.&amp;nbsp; Older kids often walk home and no one says they can&#39;t enjoy domestic life sans parents bossing them around...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, no need to paint the entire sociological picture on a tiny postage stamp of a blog post.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m just thinking of video clip episodes of high didactic value and what those might look like.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not in favor of people not reading.&amp;nbsp; Boosting the effectiveness of said clips is in no way to diss screenwriting skills.&amp;nbsp; We work together, we the graphical and lexical.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re called your hemispheres.&amp;nbsp; Your brain, dummy.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&quot;Cramming&quot; is a term used by Global U students when feeling up against a deadline to produce in some way.&amp;nbsp; In my case, we&#39;ve just finished Session 8 of 10, adding to a 40 hour course on the Python computer language.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s just one of my gigs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once mastery of core Python (keywords, builtins, special names) has been achieved, we branch out in two more of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/09/five-dimensions-of-python.html&quot;&gt;the five dimensions&lt;/a&gt;: Standard Library and 3rd Party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A fact of life in the high tech world is we&#39;re awash in toys but with little time to play with them, someone&#39;s idea of a joke perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like, Python is cram packed with interesting little gizmos, feats of genius, and future generations inherit a goldmine of possibility.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We only have time to mine a little in our day.&amp;nbsp; Mostly we&#39;re running from negative phenomena, many of them self inflicted.&amp;nbsp; Humans are not on the side of humans.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;The movie &lt;i&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; looks into this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Heading up the Python tree, a first branch is into web development.&amp;nbsp; Are we behind an HTTPS / HTTP server and if so, do we also need a database?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Web servers have become the way to share files.&amp;nbsp; You don&#39;t even need a landing page for human eyeball browsers.&amp;nbsp; Your clients are other computers and they&#39;re hungry for JSON, not HTML.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most used web servers in this regard is the Jupyter Notebook server.&amp;nbsp; Most researchers install it locally and serve themselves, from localhost:8888 or one of those.&amp;nbsp; In this case, we do want HTML, but also a running kernel capable of interpreting language X, which might be Python, but could also be JavaScript or SQL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the Python marathon, and all my &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=10267681&quot;&gt;recent victories&lt;/a&gt; around Synergetics, I&#39;m content to post less to math-teach and more to the Python websites, regarding the explorations I&#39;ve been undertaking with D. B. Koski.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He takes the LCD triangles (spherical) of the 31 great circle Icosahedron, which relate to the 25 of the cuboctahedron, and turns them into plane nets about four modules:&amp;nbsp; the E (each a 1/4 slice of the 30 rhombus 120 LCD triangle Rhombic Triacontahedron, radius 1); then: Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum (taking pronunciations from the fairy tale).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A shared edge of the Fe and Fi, which latter has E&#39;s volume &quot;phi down&quot; (phi^-3 scale factor), has a length we&#39;ve taken to calling the S Factor, likewise the ratio of VE:Icosa both of Jitterbug fame, and of S-to E-mods (S/E): about 1.08.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The icosahedron embedded within the volume 4 octahedron, of edges 2, from whence the S modules are carved, has edges that same length?&amp;nbsp; I hadn&#39;t tuned that in.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll use Python as a kind of spreadsheet, or dataframe, to explore more in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this way, I&#39;m able to keep my fingers on a keyboard, composing with mathematical concepts, while staying in shape for my morning and evening seminars, not to mention the time in schools.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m a big believer in a varied diet, so I&#39;m not painting the above regime as some frieze of the rest of my life.&amp;nbsp; However, I think having coding and/or geometry as a frequent mental activity serves the same role as walking a mile a day or visiting the gym.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Use it or lose it right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s what the professors really mean when they say &quot;publish or perish&quot; as usually how we know you haven&#39;t lost it, are using it, is we get to peer review.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The S Factor should not be confused with S3, Fuller&#39;s published constant for volumetric conversion between a Cartesian XYZ cube of edges sqrt(2) i.e. sqrt(2)^3, and an IVM-based cube with the same edges, but embracing a different &quot;unit of volume&quot;, in this case a 2-edged Tetrahedron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to a theorem, the IVM volume (tetravolume) is of said tetrahedron-embracing cube is 3, giving 3 / sqrt(2)^3 as our S3 &quot;currency conversion&quot; ratio of about&amp;nbsp;1.060660171779821 (as computed in Python), see&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: -webkit-center;&quot;&gt;Table 986.209.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
982.32&amp;nbsp; The cube formed by a uniform width, breadth, and height of sqrt(2) is sqrt(2^3), which = 2.828428. Therefore, the cube occurring in nature with the isotropic vector matrix, when conventionally calculated, has a volume of 2.828428.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An interesting discovery of Koski&#39;s regarding S3 is it&#39;s also the ratio of SuperRT / VE, i.e. the classic D-edged VE of tetravolume 20, in a Jitterbug relationship with D-edged Icosahedron, when multiplied by S3, gives the volume of the RT formed by said Icosa and its dual, the Pentagonal Dodecahedron (we call that SuperRT, &quot;phi up&quot; from the 120 E-modules RT).&lt;/div&gt;

I got Sellwood Middle School&#39;s guest Wifi unblocked from MIT Scratch web services.&amp;nbsp; That means I won&#39;t need to use Verizon for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2888711&quot;&gt;my Show &amp;amp; Tell station&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, hours later, I&#39;m at Linus Pauling House. The house WiFi is down, perhaps by design, as I don&#39;t think external groups rent the building, whereas tenants supply their own?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn is talking about collagen, macro-molecules, and new article &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/12/global-data-global-matrix.html&quot;&gt;in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp; Patchy particles made by colloidal fusion by Gong, Hueckel, Yi and Sacanna, pag 234, Volume 550.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He keeps up on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/12/global-data-global-matrix.html&quot;&gt;multiple sciences&lt;/a&gt;, as sometimes only a layman can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I say &quot;layman&quot; thinking back to the old &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/nJ229A&quot;&gt;E.J. Applewhite&lt;/a&gt; business card.&amp;nbsp; He thought this was a clever title.&amp;nbsp; I thought so too.&lt;br /&gt;

We&#39;re passing around the magazine.&lt;br /&gt;

Welcome home to a dystopia we know well.&amp;nbsp; Los Angeles is more a melting pot than ever, and there&#39;s an LAPD. However there&#39;s no real sign of national governments, only Sony, CocaCola, Peugeot and restricted air spaces. We&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/10/philip-k-dick-blade-runner/&quot;&gt;in the mind of&lt;/a&gt; Philip K. Dick, or some facsimile thereof.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sony has been researching hologram technology for some time now, in addition to acquiring digital rights. Here we get Elvis as a ghost in a dead casino, and Sinatra under glass.&amp;nbsp; The protagonist&#39;s girlfriend is a hologram.&amp;nbsp; But then he&#39;s not all there either, a synthetic human.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we&#39;re able to simulate reality and use it to manipulate emotions, we tend to get lost in our own creations. Hollywood knows a lot about that.&amp;nbsp; Are we real, or are we Memorex?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s a problem with science fiction though, which is we&#39;re so used to screen magic that we&#39;re not able to tell if these holograms are any closer in everyday experience as commercial products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some viewers may suspect Sony is sitting on some ability to generate building sized hologram ballerinas.&amp;nbsp; Most won&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve given up waiting for holograms at &lt;i&gt;Best Buy&lt;/i&gt; much as we&#39;ve given up on jet packs, as a part of that ever retreating mirage called the future.&amp;nbsp; Flying cars, yeah right.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The replicants aren&#39;t sure what&#39;s a real memory and what got placed there by clever advertising. Did I really have that birthday, or did they just stick it in my brain TV?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The protagonist, bred to think clearly, to do detective work, as a better grasp on the unreality of it all than most. &lt;br /&gt;

Wittgenstein wrote in his introduction to &lt;i&gt;Philosophical Investigations&lt;/i&gt; that it&#39;d take a culture that &quot;breathed a different air&quot; to find his philosophy understandable.&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps we&#39;re now in that culture, as understanding now spreads.&lt;br /&gt;

I&#39;m super booked this week, having committed months ago to an east coast timed Python training. I just completed Session 2 of a west coast timed training about an hour ago.&amp;nbsp; I get to snooze a few hours, then dive in again, using a somewhat alien control panel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then it&#39;s off to Sellwood to launch a new Learning to Code program, the groundwork having been laid by parents, guardians, coworkers, school staff.&amp;nbsp; Then there&#39;s MIT Scratch and Codesters, the star e-toyz of our show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carol, in the meantime, is enmeshed with Friends on the UN Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty, which is up for signing. Thanks to many media still taking most cues from DC, a lot of our people don&#39;t even know the history.&amp;nbsp; They learn to switch media if wanting to follow developments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quakers and the USG have been on opposite sides of &quot;abolition&quot; before now, with some politicians able to think ahead.&amp;nbsp; Lots of medical science reminds us that nuclear war, even just preparing for one, is toxic and unhealthy.&amp;nbsp; We lose IQ. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carol, a member of WILPF, is working closely with PSR as well.&amp;nbsp; This alphabet soup may not mean anything at the outset, but a quick search will get you in the loop, if that&#39;s where you want to be.&amp;nbsp; Some loops are intriguing, like Hyperloop One, whereas others are more noose-like, as useful as a dead albatross.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also I&#39;m on the warpath for C6XTY, an abbreviated way of saying my ethnic group has some strong biases in terms of what curriculum upgrades we need.&amp;nbsp; Getting those upgrades implemented may appear to be happening despite &quot;over my dead body&quot; style resistance, hence the warpath metaphor, suitable for &quot;inward weapons&quot; oriented Friends.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rhymes with &quot;New Math&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think we all know the pun by now: GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However in being recursively defined, it&#39;s also an allusion to Lambda
Calculus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GNU came along around Gen 2.0 of the C-STEM Epoch, which Epoch started
around PLATO (1960) and rolled through at least two revolutions: PC
(personal computer) and Liberation (free / open source).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Liberation was a long fought battle pitting the likes of GNU / Linux
against SCO. I&#39;m sure some here remember those years, followed by Browser
Wars...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where C-STEM starts hybridizing with the contemporary public schools math
sequence is around the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, that every
integer has a unique prime factorization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m going with Conway&#39;s suggestion that we throw in -1 as a factor along
with 1, go ahead and call the former prime if you like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A prime has only itself and 1 as a factor, and -1 if negative. 1 itself is
not prime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we say factors, we may include or omit the 1 (identity element)
depending on context.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;factors(42)
(1, 2, 3, 7)
factors(100)
(1, 2, 2, 5, 5)
factors(-12)
(1, -1, 2, 2, 3)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When students are ready to write code, in whatever language, to deliver
these unique prime factorizations, that&#39;s when CS starts to meet Algebra.
The Sieve of Eratosthenes, Trial By Division, Euclid&#39;s Algorithm, start
phasing in here, as things to code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, we&#39;re still doing arithmetic, using the four basic operators plus
modulo (%), but we&#39;re also introducing functions, the composition of which
will be our basis for getting work done.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Algebra has much to do with controlling the components of a function, one
might say inputs, arguments or parameters. The specifics are often fixed
with constants, as in:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A sin (Bx + C) + D&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
the paradigm oscillator. Only x is considered the dependent variable at
the end of the day, as A, B, C, D are used to construct a special case
function.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Polynomials are the same way. The coefficients fix the function, and then
x or t do the heavy lifting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A*x**3 + B*x**2 + C*x + ... we have notation for arbitrarily long lists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CS is good at this: providing an executable language wherein functions
have the ability to construct other functions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CS profs further along in the pipeline will be grateful if we start writing
functions that build functions earlier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
C-STEM has a bright future.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/albums/72157686718676603&quot; title=&quot;C6XTY Unveiling&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/4440/36814975570_c122c96096_w.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;C6XTY Unveiling&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I tried to explain this event to people by saying we were shooting raw footage for future commercials.&amp;nbsp; That might not be quite it, certainly not it entirely, however people understand the movie shoot, complete with retakes, and that&#39;s what this was, as well as a party.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sam Lanahan has been planning this event for some time, blending his personal genius with that of the many he&#39;s come to collaborate with.&amp;nbsp; Jeff is the talented engineer.&amp;nbsp; We carried the four frequency tetrahedron together.&amp;nbsp; Steffan is the talented magician, working with Hope, the athlete.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://polarastudio.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Polara&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt;brought their considerable abilities to the scene, as did the professional drone camera operator.&amp;nbsp; No, I&#39;m not forgetting the crane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Barry Redd and Glenn Stockton have been helping Sam build &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c6xty.com/&quot;&gt;C6XTY&lt;/a&gt; sculptures, which show off a non-cubic lattice, not BCP.&amp;nbsp; All the examples were CCP, but each colored and &quot;carved&quot; (in the sense of omitted balls) to create a landscape of clearly unique pieces.&amp;nbsp; One was for stress testing.&amp;nbsp; Others were for display on a grassy yard.&amp;nbsp; The biggest was for hoisting by crane so that Hope could dangle and twist therefrom, ushering in the Tension Age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I should explain the plot a little.&amp;nbsp; Steffan Soule had it worked out, with a stage magician&#39;s brick, symbolizing compression, and a bright pink and black ball of C6XTY, matched in color by Hope&#39;s harlequin outfit.&amp;nbsp; During several takes, Sam both received, and handed over, the plastic ball, the icon symbolizing Tension in this picture.&amp;nbsp; The receding Age of Compression was about the Cube.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, this all sounds esoteric and to some level indecipherable, the entropy is high, potentially.&amp;nbsp; However, I&#39;m connecting themes that go back years in these blogs, so in a way I don&#39;t feel I have the burden, in one post, to compress all these years of thinking and running experiments.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s partly what &quot;tension&quot; means:&amp;nbsp; not having to re-invent the wheel every day.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll be referring back to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/04/portland-design-week-2017.html&quot;&gt;HP4E event&lt;/a&gt; again, don&#39;t you worry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many thanks to Derek Bridges for additional photography and a twitter stream, to Tim Hitchcock (bizmo pilot) and Trevor Blake (a Fuller archivist, among other roles).&amp;nbsp; Thanks to Patrick Barton for helping move pieces from my patio to the rented truck, and to Diane for having some ideas about what all this could be about.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re still figuring that out.&amp;nbsp; The Age of Tension is often suspenseful, but perhaps less awkwardly melodramatic?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I&#39;m expecting my mentor and personal trainer, Patrick, to come over and remind me how it all works through his control panel.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve only &quot;flown&quot; (piloted) his rig once and remember Mac shortcut combos were translating to surprising combos on the Windows server.&amp;nbsp; I need to practice which combos to avoid next time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick and I were co-workers through many of the O&#39;Reilly School of Technology years.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re both friends with Steve Holden, a former neighbor, and citizen of the UK.&amp;nbsp; Steve was a major player in getting the early flagship Pycons off the ground, imitating EuroPython which came earlier.&amp;nbsp; A nonprofit named the Python Software Foundation grew up around Pycons as the organizing entity and eventually became what it is today, with Steve one of the first directors, later chairman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been dividing my attention between hurricanes and quaternions, not as distant-apart concepts as that may sound, though granted hurricanes are energetic phenomena whereas quaternions are metaphysical assets, a tool in the computer graphics library for making things rotate, around any axis, in what in XYZ-talk we call 3-space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XYZ-talk extends into Coxeter type n-space, wherein real number-lines are imagined to be mutually independent through a common origin, as many as we need.&amp;nbsp; IVM-talk is different, is what Bucky hatched in &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt;, with a little help from his friends.&amp;nbsp; IVM-talk has only a toe-hold, or beach-head or one of those, vis-a-vis contemporary academia.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re more likely to read that Bucky was crazy (quirky) or Synergetics is pseudo-math here in 2017.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve got the two talks somewhat mixed together.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, Patrick has come and gone.&amp;nbsp; We sat on the back deck overlooking the C6XTY sculpture garden. The truck will be here tomorrow, to haul most of it away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I then went upstairs to watch CBS Evening News, to get some overview on Irma.&amp;nbsp; Today is of course September 11, my wedding anniversary, as well as a day the metaphysical climate changed dramatically. &lt;/div&gt;

What&#39;s amazing is how in a few decades, the personal workspace (PWS) 
has evolved into a newsroom.&amp;nbsp; Instead of a few papers having these telex
 machine feeds, we get this blizzard of news reports, some half baked, 
others slickly misleading, all ready for editing in the virtual studio.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
 CSN CRO and I were checking out the Florida freeway system this 
morning, using Google to suggest where the worst logjams are, then 
pulling up stories.&amp;nbsp; How many freeways have committed all four lanes 
north?&amp;nbsp; Any concept of &quot;evacuation bus&quot;?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s up with the trains?&amp;nbsp; 
Why not commit railways to getting people out?&amp;nbsp; Insufficient rolling 
stock?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Houston decided to hunker down, more than 
evacuate, yet more freeways fan out from that hub, going inland, then 
you get leaving Florida.&amp;nbsp; The two sides of the peninsula provide the two
 main arterials.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;d be easy enough to get all these 
computers on different channels with several sources per screen.&amp;nbsp; Then 
it&#39;d look more like a newsroom or monitoring station.&amp;nbsp; Like a control room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took public transit out to PDX last night for a meetup with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/07/jetblues-bizmo.html&quot;&gt;JetBlue&lt;/a&gt; pilot&#39;s sister (she was flying JetBlue).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&#39;s retiring today, or at least bringing in his final flight, from Fort Lauderdale as it happens.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re having a gate party at JFK today, a JetBlue tradition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used to live full time in Florida, in a mobile home park in Bradenton.&amp;nbsp; A lot of the news stories are focused on changes to building codes since Hurricane Andrew but what&#39;s special about Florida is how much of it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.naplesnews.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2017/09/08/hurricane-irma-thousands-living-s-florida-mobile-homes-face-greater-threat/644103001/&quot;&gt;mobile home estates&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Lets not just focus on fancy beach side apartments and condos.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
