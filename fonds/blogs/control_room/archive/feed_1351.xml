Plus the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/gym-meditation.html&quot;&gt;badly misled Americans&lt;/a&gt; lost this one, a downer for some viewers, doesn&#39;t get them &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4401109n&quot;&gt;in the mood&lt;/a&gt; to think about tourism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turning to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.glassboxvoting.com/index.html&quot;&gt;voting machines&lt;/a&gt;, I see a lot of the same &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/making-history.html&quot;&gt;ahistorical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;USA Today&lt;/span&gt; style &quot;tourism journalism&quot; i.e. let&#39;s not stir up trouble with too much realism or recent history.  Lets fall back on that dream of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/11/voting-machine-story.html&quot;&gt;free and fair elections&lt;/a&gt; we learned about in &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/postpone-elections.html&quot;&gt;civics class&lt;/a&gt; (do we still teach civics in public schools, or was that abandoned for lack of courage?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sign of growing viewer maturity would be more shows that dig up what we know about &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/voting-machines.html&quot;&gt;voter fraud&lt;/a&gt; through the ages, including in America.  These shows could start way further back, not dwell on Florida or Ohio or any recent elections at first, just start moving in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let people in on more of the inside story, about how their government really works, or doesn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, we hear a lot about voter fraud in principle, but not much about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/nitty-gritty&amp;amp;r=67&quot;&gt;nitty-gritty&lt;/a&gt;.  Where&#39;s the Discovery Channel show called &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Elections&lt;/span&gt; I wonder?

Lots of psychology going on, in that here&#39;s an inter-generational setting with some wisdom of the ages being transmitted, and it&#39;s kind of dull and not beautiful, how could that be?  Why is geometry especially so godawful bereft of gorgeous visuals etc?  Why are we so far away from the arts?  Where&#39;s the stuff about music, which if you&#39;ve looked into it at all, is highly mathematical, all about ratios, not talking about Mozart Effect or listening to Bach to get smart, talking about restoring some integrity to the culture, instead of feeding it out as ground beef, fast food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless other teachers in other classrooms make a special point of some &quot;phobia&quot; then I think dwelling on this in math is merely digging a deeper hole, like how &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/08/weird-stories.html&quot;&gt;Condi&lt;/a&gt; put it -- gotta stop digging.  Math teachers just make it worse by making student resistance into some form of mental condition.  They should be looking at the content of their discipline with an eye towards radical reform i.e. the last thing on earth &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/03/underfunded-schools.html&quot;&gt;Haim&lt;/a&gt; wants us to really talk about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS:  so what&#39;s your trick for embedding little emoticons that show up via the web interface to this archive?

In a big city, you don&#39;t see them, nor is the school system offering to bus you to anywhere that you might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portland Public is a little different in having a week-long &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesd.k12.or.us/os/OutdoorSchool/&quot;&gt;Outdoor School&lt;/a&gt; for elementary school kids, although there&#39;s no assurance these few nights away from the city will include a stellar vista, given how clouded over this region gets, at all times of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Escaping the city limits remains more a family responsibility i.e. the classroom-bound teacher assumes students will get to see real stars at some point, and not just on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mesd.k12.or.us/os/starlab/STARLAB.html&quot;&gt;concave inner surface&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/location-scouting.html&quot;&gt;OMSI planetarium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heading out the Gorge during &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/06/scholars-in-summer.html&quot;&gt;summer break&lt;/a&gt;, checking out Multnomah Falls, the fish hatcheries and dams, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hill&quot;&gt;Sam Hill&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; Maryhill and Stonehenge, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/applewhites.html&quot;&gt;Crown Point&lt;/a&gt;, remain popular ventures, but then one needs to stay out late enough to see the Milky Way, perhaps from a stern-wheeler in the Columbia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK8QOtPn_3ejjJxQD2rgQAdUOdV___5rhrdvmi9aF1_sUs9VXB1HtDWWi_FBL1hXZN_733tsYNExf8-YJaQoieyJl92u4V6y6xQPYl_IdR1M4GNtETyDUd9sa4YIG0QxjxJbF/s1600-h/P8170031.JPG&quot; onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjnK8QOtPn_3ejjJxQD2rgQAdUOdV___5rhrdvmi9aF1_sUs9VXB1HtDWWi_FBL1hXZN_733tsYNExf8-YJaQoieyJl92u4V6y6xQPYl_IdR1M4GNtETyDUd9sa4YIG0QxjxJbF/s320/P8170031.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238569339746422450&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/08/elitism.html&quot;&gt;elite academies&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;m envisioning would provide plenty of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/12/starry-night.html&quot;&gt;stargazing opportunities&lt;/a&gt;, because situated sufficiently far from Greater Portland to make that feasible.  I call them &quot;elite&quot; because of the opportunities they offer, thanks to their innovative design, committed staff, and students motivated to share generously with peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portland&#39;s open source philosophy both informs and sustains our curriculum on many levels, such that surrounding communities benefit, and participate in keeping a given school localized and steeped in regional lore, much of it tracing back to times before Lewis &amp;amp; Clark or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/joomlaeotic/&quot;&gt;the Oregon Trail&lt;/a&gt;, into the dim reaches of geological time. Affiliations with tribal councils and interpretive museums will suggest plenty of work-study and skill building scenarios, sometimes involving canoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thedalleschamber.com/&quot;&gt;The Dalles&lt;/a&gt; area is a candidate location, as are high desert locations closer to Bend.  Making a resort ranch work economically, by turning it into a part time school or training center (or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wanderers.pbwiki.com/BootCamp&quot;&gt;boot camp&lt;/a&gt;&quot; if you will), is not just my idea.

Jeff has a strong sense of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/04/rebooting-mathematics.html&quot;&gt;energy-based economics&lt;/a&gt;, understands agriculture as packaging energy, getting market conversion to cover production costs and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He came prepared with hand-outs and 3x5 cards, as he had some questions for us, wanted answers in writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One question he asked was what we thought about his presentation and what we learned from it.  Wanderers were both admiring and somewhat frustrated in not having a bigger window, more insights into his techniques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see right away he&#39;s good at taking fear out of the equations.  He makes it easy for people to identify and unify around a holistic goal,  then work as a team, overcoming self-limiting beliefs in many cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/wanderers-200885.html&quot;&gt;Keith&lt;/a&gt; asked if he used the same vocabulary with each group (good question).  No, like the tribal groups translated their goal-making process into their own favorite symbols.  Recovering lost heritage was at the core of their plan, as culture itself is what they strove to sustain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many management theorists and practitioners I&#39;ve met, Jeff has his mix of metaphysical diagrams, a logical structure, ways of mirroring collaborative processes.  I was reminded of some of the eXtreme Programming (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/polymorphic-xp.html&quot;&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/03/peace-teams.html&quot;&gt;Alternatives to Violence&lt;/a&gt; (AVP) trainings I&#39;ve attended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might think one could just bottle and sell the theory part, and more scenarios would become  sustainable as a result, as tools for effective collaboration spread outward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However a lot of the results stem from experience and integrity, less easily bottled, the courage to teach 1000 head of cattle to respond to a whistle, surrounded by skeptical cowboys wondering what a guy in shorts, claiming to be from Dallas of all places, could ever teach &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;them&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another question was closer to Art Kohn&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/what-shall-i-do.html&quot;&gt;what shall I do?&lt;/a&gt;&quot;  I hope we were helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good seeing &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/phi-guy.html&quot;&gt;Lynne&lt;/a&gt; again, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/wanderers-2006830.html&quot;&gt;Milt&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/7007656227728597582'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/7007656227728597582'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/sustainability-guy.html' title='Sustainability Guy'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1150334933911384361</id><published>2008-08-18T10:30:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-08-18T10:35:31.146-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Friendly Technologies</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/together-friends.html&quot;&gt;Quakers&lt;/a&gt; have been mulling over some of these new networking tools and asking themselves how these might open new opportunities for our spiritual practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Unitarians have been thinking about this too, my thanks to a Friend for passing along &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allsoulsnyc.org/publications/sermons/ggsermons/a-steadiness-of-days.pdf&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;A STEADINESS OF DAYS&lt;br /&gt;A sermon preached by Galen Guengerich&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.allsoulsnyc.org/whoweare/history/historymain.htm&quot;&gt;All Souls Unitarian Church&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New York City June 1, 2008&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The distinction between traditional blogs and Twitter — between answering the question “What are you thinking?” as opposed to “What are you doing?”—has a theological dimension as well. In traditional terms, religion has usually been understood as a set of beliefs or a body of doctrine, which believers are called upon to accept as true. These beliefs are typically described in an inspired scripture and compiled into an authoritative creed. The liberal tradition in theology, initiated by Frederich Schleiermacher in the late 18th century and clarified by William James in his lectures on religion at the dawn of the 20th century, insists that religion is not mainly a set of beliefs. Rather, religion is first and foremost a way of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is true, and I believe it is, then the ultimate religious question is not “What are you thinking?” but rather “What are you doing?” If you want to know what we think is important, look at how we spend our time. If you want to know what we value, look at how we spend our money. If you want to know what we believe, look at how we live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;I recognize some of Galen&#39;s themes in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/aphiloview2.html&quot;&gt;Karen Armstrong&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; writing, when she talks about the importance of practice over simply believing stuff.  I would add though, that blogs don&#39;t &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;have&lt;/span&gt; to be about one&#39;s opinions, may also be a chronicle of one&#39;s doings or whatever.  But he&#39;s right that bloggers tend to be opinionated, use their blogs to register these opinions (in my case, that means lots of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/search?q=%22%28movie+review%29%22&quot;&gt;movie reviews&lt;/a&gt; for example).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1150334933911384361'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1150334933911384361'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/friendly-technologies.html' title='Friendly Technologies'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-1043823555731688238</id><published>2008-08-15T08:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-01-17T20:15:51.148-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Reviewing a Review</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;2&quot; scrolling=&quot;yes&quot; style=&quot;border:1px&quot; src=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=F6n2dZJ1POwC&amp;amp;lpg=PR1&amp;amp;ots=0E5gfs2Zbk&amp;amp;dq=%22a%20fuller%20explanation%22&amp;amp;pg=PR1&amp;amp;output=embed&quot; width=&quot;475&quot; height=&quot;475&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=&quot;font-style: italic; &quot;&gt;[ originally Message #42826 in Synergeo, dated yesterday, typos fixed, links added ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#39;m looking back at an &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;American Scientist&lt;/span&gt;, Vol 76 #1, Jan / Feb 1988, where this guy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.washington.edu/~grunbaum/&quot;&gt;Branko Grünbaum&lt;/a&gt;, University of Washington, excoriates (disses) Amy Edmondson&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;A Fuller Explanation&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, he doesn&#39;t like that she uses his &quot;multi-digit designations of chapter and verse&quot;, a cheap shot at his and Applewhite&#39;s bothering to provide a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/toc/toc.html&quot;&gt;convenient referencing system&lt;/a&gt;, common in philosophy since Wittgenstein&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5740&quot;&gt;Tractatus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But mainly he regurgitates the conventional chatter that Fuller, although &quot;an original... inventor&quot; (token butt kissing) is devoting the later part of his life to &quot;pretentious pop philosophy devoid of any basis or merit&quot;. Ahhh, a verdict so soon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So of course he can&#39;t abide Amy&#39;s attempt to use the currency of his inner circle, the Birkhäuser name, the academic claptrap of his smug professoriate. He takes the publisher to task, and the editor. Tsk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The logical fallacy here is begging the question -- of whether Fuller was doing legitimate philosophy with this particular anti-Bucky team rushing to premature judgment, quickly closing the door on further study in academia once he was safely dead and gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That plan hasn&#39;t worked out though, as Fuller had some real and lasting contributions to make (duh). In retrospect, one might conclude Amy stretched too heroically to make a bridge to a dying culture, but one can&#39;t blame her for at least giving it a college try. I admire her gumption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grünbaum is right about the triakis icosahedron though, better surface to volume ratio than icosa, because closer to spherical. And yes, we keep doing everything we were doing around spheres, just note that we&#39;re happy enough with the physical ones, don&#39;t need the &quot;perfect&quot; abstractions really i.e. &quot;approximate&quot; is more our style (copying nature&#39;s perfection, not imaginary perfection -- JB and I debated this for quite awhile I recall (the meaning of &quot;perfection&quot;, not required we all agree)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirby</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1043823555731688238'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1043823555731688238'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/reviewing-review.html' title='Reviewing a Review'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-2055177754222005375</id><published>2008-08-13T13:21:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-01-20T21:09:26.276-08:00</updated><title type='text'>More Mathcasting</title><content type='html'>&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/WHRQrJutLs4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/WHRQrJutLs4&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: center&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;colliding A &amp;amp; B modules&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/xbuJPytrjFI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/xbuJPytrjFI&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: center; FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;prepare to be surprised&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note&lt;/em&gt;: it&#39;s not all that clear what A &amp;amp; B modules are from these videos, but they&#39;re sorta fun nonetheless.

The equivalent in computer world is jumping right to a drag and drop development environment without knowing anything about what&#39;s happening under the hood, be that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1784103&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;SQL&lt;/a&gt;, HTML or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-August/008696.html&quot;&gt;Visual Basic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Know-nothing grads of such &quot;house of cards&quot; curricula then get jobs as &quot;programmers&quot; with most employers none the wiser -- until real change happens.  Without mastery of the basics, one becomes overly dependent on out-sourced IQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This idea of &quot;the future&quot; as some place where people &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/wall-e-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;just sit back&lt;/a&gt; and push buttons, leaving &quot;real thinking&quot; to nebulous others (high priests?), was all premised on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/04/philosophy-posting.html&quot;&gt;bankrupt Artificial Intelligence program&lt;/a&gt; (remember &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuYedeR-Tiw&quot;&gt;HAL&lt;/a&gt;?).  In actual fact, we need thinkers, not robots, and not helpless dweebs who can&#39;t multiply their way out of a paper bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course knowing the times tables eventually becomes second nature, just more reflexes at the end of the day.  But the point is you&#39;ve learned to train your own body and mind (good precedent!), like an athlete does, through hard work and perseverance.

A slogan for this version:  &quot;this Joker isn&#39;t joking&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So a lot of our gangster land stereotypes like &quot;Chicago crime boss&quot; inherit from Prohibition Era in the USA, a kind of Taliban period of Puritanical Sharia, which didn&#39;t work.  Also, consenting adults couldn&#39;t date with an eye towards having sex, without one or the other (or both) being considered &quot;up to something&quot; of a criminal nature.  Go read your psycho-history if you don&#39;t believe me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this more updated Gotham, it&#39;s not quite clear what the ferry boat people are really up to, sin wise.  They&#39;re supposed to fail some Joker test of depravity, but don&#39;t let me spoil it for you.  What we &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; know is batman is sinning.  He lusts for that girl (who wouldn&#39;t?) and he&#39;s indulging in like superhero spy powers, worse than the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/big-foot-strikes.html&quot;&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to listening in.  The guy has clearly gone over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/science_news/4274474.html&quot;&gt;dark side&lt;/a&gt;.  We explore that in the subplot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my point being, it&#39;d be difficult to recast this for &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/09/more-global-data.html&quot;&gt;Amsterdam&lt;/a&gt; or some of those Asian cities, which just don&#39;t share the same history.  Remember that batman &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/batman-begins-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;is an expat&lt;/a&gt; in some ways, and so probably confused by his role, which is why he needs that British imperial type (whom I like) to keep reminding him who he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m relieved Morgan Freeman is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/marc_malkin/b22657_morgan_freeman_released_from_hospital.html&quot;&gt;reporting doing well&lt;/a&gt; after that car crash and treatment in the Elvis Presley Hospital.

Also, in saying suitable for condos, I&#39;m not saying this is a new mortgage game, more like college dorms in most cases, i.e. your company supplies room and meal tickets, for the time you&#39;re visiting Tokyo or whatever, few strings, more like timeshare in Orlando (fewer strings though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2] For those curious about math education reform in the computer age, I recommend my &lt;a href=&quot;http://showmedo.com/videos/video?name=1010050&amp;amp;fromSeriesID=101&quot;&gt;Chicago Talk on ShowMeDo&lt;/a&gt;, overlaps with what many in physics are doing, including in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/04/more-first-person-physics.html&quot;&gt;First Person Physics&lt;/a&gt; (an approach I helped innovate, more in my journals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----Original Message-----&lt;br /&gt;From: Education about physics-related social topics&lt;br /&gt;Sent: Thursday, August 07, 2008 11:51 AM&lt;br /&gt;Subject: Re: quick fix energy solutions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to laugh a little when I read this. I don&#39;t know how other areas are doing, but in Rhode Island the major commuting bus service, RIPTA, just closed many routes because of the increased cost of fuel. One would think that this would be the ideal time to expand routes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also have a problem with all the newbies riding bicycles. The bike paths along the sides of existing streets require cyclists to stop at intersections to allow cars to make right hand turns. The cyclists refuse to do this - many have been quoted as saying that there are no stop signs at each intersection on the main streets so they are not obligated to stop. There is a proposal before our city council to erect 4 way or all way stop signs at every intersection involving streets having a bike path. That should really help traffic flow and reduce fuel consumption - not!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/537815737387307662'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/537815737387307662'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/physics-chatter.html' title='Physics Chatter'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-5209815919546920771</id><published>2008-08-05T22:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-08-06T11:56:56.737-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Wanderers 2008.8.5</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoklV2EIrGeO5YqhQ2e_knNRRpAc6P11HNh4nPx_RdGYuCOwC-mF_loe7muMt5NHnxs53vQa4iNBEPO1FSU1Wa4FF4qqHkkTNDwZXvi4uz-2ViTsAo_O85pHmQWBeD_5J6_hhj/s1600-h/lofstrom.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgoklV2EIrGeO5YqhQ2e_knNRRpAc6P11HNh4nPx_RdGYuCOwC-mF_loe7muMt5NHnxs53vQa4iNBEPO1FSU1Wa4FF4qqHkkTNDwZXvi4uz-2ViTsAo_O85pHmQWBeD_5J6_hhj/s320/lofstrom.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5231255464378191810&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Keith is building up to explaining his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.launchloop.com/&quot;&gt;Lofstrom Launch Loop&lt;/a&gt; (not a space elevator), a science fiction idea that could drive some interesting techie toons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s doing a good job of discussing the work involved in achieving orbit with traditional rockets, like that vertical stretch of a space shuttle&#39;s venture is but a preamble, after which she turns 90 degrees and continues accelerating like crazy to reach orbital speed... Instructive slides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those ill-fated fuel tanks with O-rings wouldn&#39;t have needed O-rings if they hadn&#39;t been built in sections in order to fit through Rocky Mountain train tunnels, given where Congress insisted on building them.  Didn&#39;t know that before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He calls our Spaceship Earth &quot;the first space colony&quot; which seems a good way of looking at it, although &quot;colony&quot; implies we&#39;re really aliens in disguise.  We do a good job of fooling ourselves in that case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rocket science &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; pretty difficult by the way, as fuel makes things heavy, requiring more fuel, which gets spent, lightening the load.  So how much do you need?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keith speculates Earth may lose its Moon at some point, given how angular momentum keeps transferring to it, rotation here slowing.  Dick Pugh is in the audience, corroborating some of the astronomy.  David Feinstein is asking good questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The launch loop uses magnetic induction to push solid iron at high enough speeds (about 14 km / sec) to dynamically support a giant monorail that soars 80 km out into space, follows the curvature of the earth, and comes back in, with turnarounds of 15 km radius (hence &quot;loop&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Payloads get strapped on maglev sleds at West Station, at the end of a 10% deflection, with different models for freight or people.  These small truck sized sleds, likely rocket equipped to fine tune the orbit, accelerate with up to 3 gees of force along the monorail, achieving orbital velocities.  They do this by loosely coupling with the monorail&#39;s induction field in some way, lots of experiments still needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The return rail runs parallel, lasers pointing between them, tracking distances with high precision.  This feedback, along with information from other sensors, goes to the controlling electronics required to keep the loop stable (various differential equations apply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s a whopping 130,000 tons of force needing to be deflected around each of the underwater turnarounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheathed acceleration track is quite small in diameter (mere centimeters), is strapped to floats in the ocean along the equator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keith says we&#39;ve had suitable materials since the 1970s (e.g. Xylon for anchor straps), although the choices are even better today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People might experiment with this to get more satellites doing low power cellular, plus there are sports opportunities.  He&#39;s got some numbers for the bean counters to crunch on.

I found his discussion of the Vikings highly satisfying, even though I spent a lot of it trying to establish an Internet connection, Patrick assisting, and whispering to Nancy, from Terry&#39;s desk in the alcove.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Allen framed the entire talk as if he were trying to myth bust one final question, as to whether the Vikings were exploring in Minnesota (so-called) in pre-Columbian times.  The running joke is how some to this day dispute the &quot;yay&quot; answer, given the runes and moorage holes, no reason to have not, other than potentially unfriendly natives (not a new problem).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the Viking side, the Estonians (today known as) basically asked for better supervision, after trying hillbilly feuding and preferring a skillful style.  Three brothers got the ball rolling, on a 700 year dynasty, which USA school kids study too little, hearing only about Rome ad nauseam, as if all we cared about were around the Mediterranean.  He told many more stories besides those, plus got into showing a lot about the ships, sometimes crewed by women right to the top, but they didn&#39;t wear horns in battle (another myth, popularized by comic strips to this day).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, it&#39;s sad that we inflict the story of poor delusional Columbus on school kids, make them think he &quot;discovered America&quot; in any important way.  But once these stories worm their way into a culture, there&#39;s not much you can do about &#39;em, except now and then underline what garbage gets handed out in the guise of &quot;learning&quot; even from universities that should know better.  And no, I&#39;m not forgetting about those Chinese in 1421 or whatever (dates subject to change without notice).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1694810906715944605'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/1694810906715944605'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/wanderers-2008730.html' title='Wanderers 2008.7.30'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-7811993056442878273</id><published>2008-07-27T15:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-10-13T23:41:20.231-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Infrastructure Parks</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/GAHdlgQLviY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/GAHdlgQLviY&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: lock simulation in Second Life ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A recent theme of various meetings: &quot;infrastructure parks&quot; for young people, providing them with opportunities to familiarize themselves with dikes, dams, barge channels, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/falkirk/falkirkwheel/index.html&quot;&gt;locks&lt;/a&gt;, cranes for shifting loads between water and rail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are more than just toys in some ways, as they&#39;re serving as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontheissues.org/2008/Bill_Richardson_Technology.htm&quot;&gt;job simulation tools&lt;/a&gt; -- a reason to call them &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/toyz.html&quot;&gt;toyz&lt;/a&gt; instead, as in e-toyz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some versions of these facilities are run indoors, mostly for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shipanalytics.com/MS/SHS.asp&quot;&gt;university level&lt;/a&gt; students.

Some libraries give free access to larger chunks I&#39;m supposing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A given article is all over the map in storage, mirroring how newspapers scatter content across pages, mixed with ads etc., making this problem an ideal candidate for a mapReduce solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfuGBGeMvqzSetcPkkUFTFlk8pDhY3nlVtzMEUvrC0NqKaPtyemJdlX02jn9cHPAhmNpxv-jMGvbVxxVItLl1duxasoYNIlommoctnKBpUmZyVnhDqjet4UCh_PdLfydQFsMjv/s1600-h/transcendentalist.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfuGBGeMvqzSetcPkkUFTFlk8pDhY3nlVtzMEUvrC0NqKaPtyemJdlX02jn9cHPAhmNpxv-jMGvbVxxVItLl1duxasoYNIlommoctnKBpUmZyVnhDqjet4UCh_PdLfydQFsMjv/s320/transcendentalist.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5226439274680157986&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;excerpt re Bucky, NYT, April 5, 1963, pg. 33&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The project:  copy source data to Amazon&#39;s S3 service, then boot custom Linux Xen images with Hadoop using Amazon&#39;s EC2 service, one master with multiple slaves, and kick off the job request.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 100 computers running simultaneously processed 4.3 TB of TIFF images in about 24 hours for about $240 in computing costs, and $650 for storage.  A small mistake meant running it twice (not a big deal, given these low costs and fast turnaround).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setting up &lt;a href=&quot;http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;The TimesMachine&lt;/a&gt; was a side benefit and spin-off from said project, able to serve full pages of the NY Times, complete with ads etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hadoop uses commodity hardware and software to provide a framework for storing petabytes of data, is implemented in Java, has about 15 committers currently, 3 for Hbase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HDFS and HBase store the data, with mapReduce used for processing.  Facebook is a contributor and user, as is Yahoo, which implements Hadoop internally on multiple 2k clusters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s lots of academic interest in this framework, with universities getting into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A key characteristic of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadoop&quot;&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt; is separating metadata from data, scaling the former (the namenode) vertically, the latter (storage and I/O nodes) horizontally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re talking simple sequential files mostly, with an append operation but no random access write operation.  This is not a relational database.  The design keeps file blocks physically close to the client for reading and writing, automatically takes care of replicating blocks to redundant locations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage units report on their blocks to the namenode, which runs completely in memory, and which takes appropriate action if blocks are over or under replicated.  If a server fails, a common enough occurance in large data centers, the surviving blocks get replicated up to quota (like RAID, but across multiple hosts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node33.html&quot;&gt;RPC&lt;/a&gt; is used for interprocess communication.  Lots of improvements on the drawing board, being implemented, many having to do with scaling.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/9011004053304633429'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/9011004053304633429'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/success-story-hadoop-nyt.html' title='Success Story: Hadoop + NYT'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfuGBGeMvqzSetcPkkUFTFlk8pDhY3nlVtzMEUvrC0NqKaPtyemJdlX02jn9cHPAhmNpxv-jMGvbVxxVItLl1duxasoYNIlommoctnKBpUmZyVnhDqjet4UCh_PdLfydQFsMjv/s72-c/transcendentalist.png" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3607905352289718689</id><published>2008-07-23T13:48:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-15T02:35:51.874-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Making History</title><content type='html'>Our cult leader Tim O&#39;Reilly is helping launch OSCON 10 (or The Perl Conference 12), encouraging us to keep chronofiles (logs, journals, personal accounts, autobiographies).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The open source trajectory, as popularized by Eric Raymond in the 1990s, using this quote attributed to Gandhi:  first they ignore us, then they laugh at us, then they fight us... then we win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.djangoproject.com/&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/&quot;&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zimbra.com/&quot;&gt;Zimbra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/&quot;&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danga.com/memcached/&quot;&gt;memcached&lt;/a&gt;... these are topics on the uptick (over 200% growth rate).

The overly paranoid indulge in sociopathic behaviors -- not a new problem.  Better data (better reality checks) provide an antidote in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do we do adequately police against dangerous substances and/or crazy schemes while preserving individual privacy i.e. how do we have freedoms and security at the same time?  Does detecting &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/03/wanderers-20070307.html&quot;&gt;one pot molecule&lt;/a&gt; mean emptying the meeting hall for mandatory breath testing?

Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin were founding geeks, we should get inspiration from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would these talking points help:  no secret software for public sensing data; no secret software for public voting data?  There&#39;s a difference between software and data though.  We need some more clarity here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overhearing geeks later, I heard both discomfort and relief over the fact that keynoters would take such bulls by the horns (brave of them -- geeks with courage, imagine that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDOkDTYuQzpoaZnSVc7OgelXMuUuqxwTAbYYM2W1IgvRPrIxU6Rwpq2Ig3JbcXFKZ8Ycmfu_z-PIi6tQNSS5cJU6NOyuiupi1-Ne6kqvnguzGsPhKGpAuj3bul1jWLXVPKjNwl/s1600-h/sun_mysql.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgDOkDTYuQzpoaZnSVc7OgelXMuUuqxwTAbYYM2W1IgvRPrIxU6Rwpq2Ig3JbcXFKZ8Ycmfu_z-PIi6tQNSS5cJU6NOyuiupi1-Ne6kqvnguzGsPhKGpAuj3bul1jWLXVPKjNwl/s320/sun_mysql.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5226342030829063778&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tim is interviewing MySQL principals about their acquisition by Sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sun is an old engineering company making some of the same adjustments IBM had to make when embracing Linux (my spin), as now engineers used to writing secret code have that feeling of perfect strangers scanning their source (an uncomfortable feeling sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim is reminding us of our original Unix philosophy (related to Shuttleworth&#39;s emphasis on designing for extensibility): get a lot of pieces that work together in potentially unexpected ways (through hacking), each doing one thing well, don&#39;t always think you need to reinvent the wheel by writing these large monolithic monsters.

Of paradigmatic math learning value, is some simple game engine that embodies a lot of key &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html&quot;&gt;focal points&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, consider an old fashioned slot machine of side-by-side wheels, each speeding up at the stroke of a crank, reaching maximum spin, then slowing to a stop, giving a line-up of pictures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In software, we might control the speed with a parabola, sine wave or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/catenary.html&quot;&gt;catenary&lt;/a&gt;, some curve of varying spin speed through time, satisfying to the viewer (the physics might be somewhat other-worldly given the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/more-oscon-keynotes.html&quot;&gt;freedoms&lt;/a&gt; software permits).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the meantime, the possible line-ups, their relative frequencies, serves as a basis for combinatorics.  Both smoothly continuous, and discrete, in one simple package.  Then you&#39;ve got the money aspect, ties to computing in business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pygame.org/projects/20/461/&quot;&gt;Pygame&lt;/a&gt; would be a suitable development environment for this open source project.  Our school teachers will serve as knowing tour guides, taking us through the source code line by line on some days, discussing the odds in poker on another (we don&#39;t just look at slots, on the contrary this is about many language game types).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whereas slot machines have a somewhat poor reputation, for demanding so little of their students (some would claim there&#39;s an art), our evolved games environment suggests many ways to reward learning behaviors, using guided meditations, exercises, puzzles, to develop various competencies (and yes, there&#39;s a limit to what screens will teach you).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, that all sounds quite Pavlovian, and so fits with all those card-playing dogs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What we do in our cube farms is likewise &quot;playing against the house&quot; maybe losing in some dimensions, but in a sense we&#39;re part owner and so &quot;paying ourselves&quot; to live and learn from experience.&lt;br /&gt;

We come from all walks of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the highlights was talking with Leslie over lunch, after my interest group, about &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/12/quaker-infrastructure.html&quot;&gt;Paul Laffoley&#39;s art&lt;/a&gt; and those designs for &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2687565.stm&quot;&gt;a World Trade Center &lt;/a&gt;based on Gaudi&#39;s work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She just happened to have an envelope, right there at the table, full of pictures of the Gaudi church in Barcelona, still under construction, which she&#39;d visited recently.  She also knew of another James Nayler bio still in the pipeline, will maybe get some more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe (likewise through Princeton) taught me later, over lunch, how Gaudi used bird bones to help teach himself architecture (Joe is a vet, knows quite a bit about animals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talent night included some stellar numbers.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/community-night.html&quot;&gt;Luci and Katie&lt;/a&gt; sang a duet again, which I much enjoyed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara joined Junior Friends in a skit about what each was in jail for (hence the tattoos), always something to do with deviating from Quaker practice and/or the &quot;good order of Friends&quot; (GOOF).  One &quot;misjudged the sense of the meeting&quot; whereas another had &quot;spoken beyond her light.&quot;  Tara confessed to &quot;skipping plenary... twice&quot; (hey, opting out of tedious business processes shouldn&#39;t land one in jail!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuifMq3kIKmbct4H_ptRKCEMEcyd_hsqFYm8fObck2HYcW9X5epbVkYonVgUNWAAEfq4r7tNfWZp1VM768dPUz_ajakt7C_uIsDleuRKn0DRV50819sDBATI2yf8ShCx4VOeaW/s1600-h/p7190040.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjuifMq3kIKmbct4H_ptRKCEMEcyd_hsqFYm8fObck2HYcW9X5epbVkYonVgUNWAAEfq4r7tNfWZp1VM768dPUz_ajakt7C_uIsDleuRKn0DRV50819sDBATI2yf8ShCx4VOeaW/s320/p7190040.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5225160616576409858&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Joe &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Mom got on stage with the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Raging Grannies&lt;/span&gt; who led us in some favorite anti-war numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sarah&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quakeryouth.org/quipbook/&quot;&gt;Quaker Youth Book Project of QUIP&lt;/a&gt; looks promising, reminds me of our local AFSC&#39;s United Voices (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/05/more-basement-archeology.html&quot;&gt;UV&lt;/a&gt;) in some ways.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/10527701@N06/sets/72157606234279085/&quot;&gt;Kathy&lt;/a&gt; gave me a little more background.

It&#39;s too late to register for this year, so these handsome booklets fall in the &quot;remainder&quot; category.

I listened in on what Jesus had to say on the divorce issue, per those up on this topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My input was North Americans are mostly not married in the Biblical sense, given how different the culture from anything so Middle Eastern in flavor.  On the other hand, many if not most North Americans are rather anxious to project themselves into those Biblical characters, so it hardly matters about the anthropology here, as it&#39;s the high caliber of the storytelling that counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggested maybe removing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Leviticus&lt;/span&gt; from the Bible as too steamily pornographic, too triple-X, but I didn&#39;t sense much agreement for that.  Anyway, no one really plans to monkey with the table of contents at this late a date, so my talk was a tad on the idle side (Wittgenstein:  language on vacation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also talked about bicycle helmets quite a bit, about whether Oregonians were becoming more lax about using them, more like Floridians in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Leviticus&lt;/span&gt; could maybe be made into a cartoon, like by &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/american-pop-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Ralph Bakshi&lt;/a&gt; or someone, probably already has been (like I&#39;m not an authority on things Middle Eastern).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a run on the coffee, with OSU staff realizing we&#39;re fiends for this drug of choice (Beanites ya know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then Sarah and I then sat outside, talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-about-quakers.html&quot;&gt;good old days&lt;/a&gt;, about Dawn, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/04/bumper-sticker.html&quot;&gt;about karma&lt;/a&gt;, about our spiritual journeys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economist in the golf cart (a designated driver) thought NPYMers were becoming too much like ordinary Americans in wanting to &quot;do business&quot; in a plodding fashion, as if a mere $40K budget were anything worth more than a CEO&#39;s sneeze -- yet here we were, making it the business of all adult attenders, complete with auditorium and microphone, blech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recounted the oral history I&#39;d learned, which is that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npym.org/&quot;&gt;NPYM&lt;/a&gt; split off from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pacificyearlymeeting.org/&quot;&gt;PYM&lt;/a&gt; a couple generations ago precisely because the latter had grown too stodgey, was too caked with cruft (i.e. &quot;business&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FGC is more the role model here, in terms of focusing on the spiritual aspects of our Society, although we&#39;d prefer to have our own event, aren&#39;t members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fgcquaker.org/&quot;&gt;FGC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So maybe we&#39;ll manage to take back our (sub)culture? The numbers are against us it seems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/bridge-pedal-in-rear-view-mirror.html&quot;&gt;Bridge Pedal&lt;/a&gt; pal and small airplane pilot, was planning to fly down for this meeting, arriving this morning, but still needed a ride to the airport.  I hope he found one, as it&#39;s a beautiful day for flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diane gave me $6 found on the floor near where I was sitting, given her by another honest friend.  It was probably not mine originally, so I used it in the Quaker book store on behalf of my NPYM &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/literary-investigation.html&quot;&gt;Interest Group&lt;/a&gt;, purchasing Pendle Hill Pamphlet 395:  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Walt Whitman&#39;s Spiritual Epic&lt;/span&gt; by Michael Robertson, with $1 to spare for the Wanderers coffee fund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Tara&#39;s first year as an NPYM Teen, having graduated from Tweens already (time flies).  Andy and I discussed the nomenclature around these age groupings.  He prefers &quot;middle school&quot; versus &quot;high school&quot; as more descriptive, less ambiguous, than than &quot;Central&quot; versus &quot;Junior&quot; Friends (context matters).  Andy clerks our Teen Program back in Portland, whereas starting this month I&#39;m more an &quot;adult ed&quot; kind of guy (as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=206&amp;amp;threadID=1394506&amp;amp;messageID=5669653#5669653&quot;&gt;No Adult Left Behind&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjo4k09bOFOSk4cfkNJSsczShIB5I_9BJeYkwC5Z7knfdMfNcrbdg9jBhda6_vFv-KMydp2qtIhByPGWjNT8h0svbNTKNRdRhKTw-skWHFJvNDdXX1iAT2V1vrwuBpSKZfq6Cky/s1600-h/p7190041.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjo4k09bOFOSk4cfkNJSsczShIB5I_9BJeYkwC5Z7knfdMfNcrbdg9jBhda6_vFv-KMydp2qtIhByPGWjNT8h0svbNTKNRdRhKTw-skWHFJvNDdXX1iAT2V1vrwuBpSKZfq6Cky/s200/p7190041.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5225161187096543522&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;mom with FCNL lobbyist and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Friend in Residence Ruth Flower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4908772982829062166'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4908772982829062166'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/annual-session-part-one.html' title='Annual Session (Part One)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjo4k09bOFOSk4cfkNJSsczShIB5I_9BJeYkwC5Z7knfdMfNcrbdg9jBhda6_vFv-KMydp2qtIhByPGWjNT8h0svbNTKNRdRhKTw-skWHFJvNDdXX1iAT2V1vrwuBpSKZfq6Cky/s72-c/p7190041.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-6254035782330617631</id><published>2008-07-16T07:19:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-16T19:04:31.964-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Persepolis (movie review)</title><content type='html'>Although &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0808417/&quot;&gt;this cartoon&lt;/a&gt; pokes fun at the Japanese at one point, for their seeming obsession with Godzilla movies, I sensed more than a little Japanese influence, to positive effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In anime, we get this motif of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457246/&quot;&gt;the sudden outburst&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; a kind of formalized volatility against a background of uniformity and social conformity.  Outbursts form &quot;key frames&quot; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://judson.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/lets-get-rid-of-darwinism/index.html&quot;&gt;punctuated equilibrium&lt;/a&gt; of character development, and this film is all about character development, in a hellish forge called Iran in some circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authorities like to see their wills reflected in terms of fashion, which pulls them into popular culture in competition with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/mi3-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;movie stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/meeting-math.html&quot;&gt;rock stars&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/poor-slob-bucky-psb.html&quot;&gt;other role models&lt;/a&gt;, many out of reach, yet present in the media, raw material for rebellious counter cultures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pattern is not unique to any one capital or metro area i.e. that sense of &quot;subversive influences&quot; is all pervasive, only differs in outward form. That sense of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;future shock&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (a shocking future) is not confined to Islamic and/or &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/more-quaker-futurism.html&quot;&gt;Gringo&lt;/a&gt; cultures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Persepolis&lt;/span&gt; is all about keeping hope alive while surrounded by oldsters facing both different &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; similar challenges.  Our Iranian girlfriend must &quot;dismiss as irrelevant&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/omnihalo.html&quot;&gt;a Buckyism&lt;/a&gt;), i.e. do her own thinking, just to get through her day, and yet her grandmother, uncle, parents, give her useful and very necessary guidance (regarding divorce for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She sure could have used some better girlfriends in Vienna though.  Going straight from nuns to boys is a huge leap for anyone.  Don&#39;t jump off a cliff, use the stairs (build yourself slowly, take your time).  She survived, but just barely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbert Marcuse argued that private business worlds tend to commodify subversive artifacts, in the form of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentai&quot;&gt;underground comix&lt;/a&gt; for example, instead of banning or burning them outright.  Capitalism was subversive of subversion in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/marcuse/works/one-dimensional-man/index.htm&quot;&gt;his book&lt;/a&gt;, a source of undermining &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;mindlessness&lt;/span&gt; (sounds kinda Zen, come to think of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rather than decry this tendency to &quot;one dimensionalize&quot; (render harmless), one should consider the alternatives.  The message I got from this film is spirited female civilians don&#39;t necessarily support or admire spattering blood everywhere (it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mrscleannw.com/tips/blood-stain-removal.html&quot;&gt;hard to get out&lt;/a&gt; for one thing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the fashion-minded authorities and their pop culture nemeses are inwardly consumed by horrific fantasies, and spoiling for opportunities to act them out, then &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;why not&lt;/span&gt; flatten them to the screen, as cartoons even, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/crosscultural-workouts.html&quot;&gt;or video games&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/10/good-night-and-good-luck-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;order pizza&lt;/a&gt; instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iranian gals really seem more civilized, just wanna have fun, while the guys keep &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/10/control-rooms.html&quot;&gt;wrecking it&lt;/a&gt; with lots of atrocious behavior masked with vapid preachiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Persepolis is potentially a step up from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/batman-begins-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Gotham&lt;/a&gt;, again thanks in part to Japan&#39;s spirited business world, a welcome source of pacifism in the currently shrill and shallow climate.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6254035782330617631'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6254035782330617631'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/persepolis-movie-review.html' title='Persepolis (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-7673912966828854584</id><published>2008-07-15T21:58:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-11-15T02:35:53.437-08:00</updated><title type='text'>WRDL:  Control Room</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

may be its celebration of the self, including its so-called &quot;earthly&quot; (or &quot;earthy&quot;) aspects which some other traditions have tended to demonize, or at least ridicule, in an effort to dominate or control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making the self or persona a project, or series of projects (as in &quot;self reinvention&quot;), requires a level of detachment, which is where &quot;transcendence&quot; enters the equations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, the alchemical archetype surrounding such work is one of serene &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/p4200.html&quot;&gt;equanimity&lt;/a&gt;, versus wallowing in paranoia and/or megalomania and/or other obnoxious conditions, each with its attendant signs of imbalance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://leavesofgrass.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Walt Whitman&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Songs of Myself&lt;/span&gt; gives a good sense of the aesthetic that helped get the ball rolling here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/search?q=identity+management&quot;&gt;Managing one&#39;s identity&lt;/a&gt; is a responsibility, and a privilege, not a curse, a way to participate in Creation just as surely as having a body is (the two go together).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The association of &quot;subjectivity&quot; with &quot;responsibility&quot; is in contrast to more repressive teachings about cultivating &quot;cold dispassion&quot; towards &quot;untrustworthy emotions&quot; or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Celebrating the integrity of one&#39;s subjective individuality hearkens back to Kierkegaard&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Concluding Unscientific Postscript&lt;/span&gt;, which exposes the hollowness of hiding out behind some omniscient- sounding &quot;objective voice&quot; and using that voice to tell history, versus accepting personal responsibility for adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/gnuvy-krew-calculus.html&quot;&gt;a spin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accepting responsibility for &quot;creating a self&quot; is an essential move within &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/jarhead-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;existentialism&lt;/a&gt; and related psychologies, in turn a healing response to the devastation of WWI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Post-modernism was perhaps more rebellious than brave in its protests against &quot;objectivity&quot; (associated with authoritarian voice overs, especially in documentary film making), whereas more rugged individualists, such as Hunter S. Thompson, embraced a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Journalism&quot;&gt;new journalism&lt;/a&gt;&quot; on the understanding that these wildly differing perspectives might co-exist as our collective heritage within our shared democratic context (worth defending!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making &quot;identity crafting&quot; a chief responsibility (like a full time job) is akin to the &quot;soul-making&quot; project of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillman&quot;&gt;James Hillman&lt;/a&gt;, a Jungian talking about individuation, or &quot;self actualization&quot; (Maslow).  The alchemical experience of Synergy is one of a guiding and/or intuitive hand (God&#39;s grace and/or will), such that one&#39;s own person becomes a vehicle for surfing atop a broader, more oceanic intelligence, an experience of Inner Light as Quakers are wont to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minus transcendence, &quot;identity crafting&quot; degenerates into shallow self- absorption, other lower forms of consciousness (or unconsciousness).  The Catholics are right to warn us about the high cost of vanity, the prideful taking of personal credit for that which emerged from deeper sources.  The ego is not forged by the ego alone, another way of casting the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/singer.htm&quot;&gt;no self nature&lt;/a&gt;&quot; teaching, a dharma  perpetually frustrating to Milton&#39;s Satan in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/span&gt;.  To invert Paul Tillich&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromwatchtower.com/tilground.html&quot;&gt;pithy meme&lt;/a&gt;, it takes courage to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not be&lt;/span&gt; as well (i.e. to accept the only quasi- or even pseudo- reality of the persona, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/search?q=mask&quot;&gt;the mask&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Individuation actually involves increasing one&#39;s awareness of otherness,  multiplying the variety of viewpoints from which one&#39;s self and one&#39;s world might be viewed.  Fuller quotes Robert Burns on this subject, at the start of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seedsofunfolding.org/issues/xvii/resources_1.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Critical Path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;Oh                          wad some power the giftie gie us to see oursels as others                          see us.&quot;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/supplements_17.html&quot;&gt;Know thyself!&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/7217106719648987982'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/7217106719648987982'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/on-individualism-transcendentalism.html' title='On Individualism &amp; Transcendentalism'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrwyMaCHixEpmHSQtyNUXy-mNHOCYYXWIqjo-N7DQSEj2FkF59VKIe-NV1yb9oWzJ5kwlnm_y5oQc0wQMRaFUcAfWiTcE2mUTBxJ25MgSVA7BiLi_CQlAWUZPBnYt4sp-7U0lK/s72-c/still_life_july.png" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-2151579318601671003</id><published>2008-07-12T06:50:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-03-26T16:20:47.398-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Psy War:  Who&#39;s Losing?</title><content type='html'>You get these pundits on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fox&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt; decrying Iran&#39;s plans to weaponize fission, not realizing the greater danger, to them, to their careers, is if Iran is telling the truth, is only interested in the civilian possibilities of nuclear power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latter case, suggested as credible by the NSA, you have these &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/jihad.html&quot;&gt;hypocrites&lt;/a&gt; coming before the world saying &quot;&lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; have a God given right to do this, but we&#39;ll kill &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; if they try it&quot; i.e. almost the essence of an indefensible position.
