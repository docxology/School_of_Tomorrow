Crazy TV:  the nutcase killer is lionized in puffed up police 
punditry as &quot;wanting to weaken the United State&quot; i.e. this was an 
international event involving a terrorist organization (Mr. ISIS pops 
up, out of cold storage, right here on CBS).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This isn&#39;t another
 brain dead victim of our zombie media, not a completely out of his 
depth gun nut with a case of the Columbines. No, this is international 
warfare, as this veteran (so many of them veterans) was on the brink of 
joinin&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;g ISIS, or no, he&#39;d joined 
already, no wait... the details won&#39;t matter, now that the link has been
 made (for us, by the media mogul caliphate).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;
Another worn out husk of an NPC (non-playable dead end scenario, no 
more good cards) of the type we used to see in a medical facility 
(called an asylum or sanitarium) and not necessarily in a jail.  
Cuckoos&#39; Nest if you wanna be unkind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then compassionate 
America decided to give them all shopping carts and to push them out on the 
streets.  Vets get shown the same door. &quot;Go enjoy vulture capitalism, 
they need to feed.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &quot;Go be in some &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/i&gt; episode.&quot;&amp;nbsp; &quot;Have a midlife opioid crisis.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We made a distinction back then, in the old 
country (the one before this one), between a mental case and an enemy
 soldier, also between a mental case and an international terrorist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now we live in Crazy TV Time, wherein every mutant monster, 
every victim of some hideous epigenetic meme virus disease (some go back
 centuries), is really who they think they are, in their dying rants 
and manifestos.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get to be in their world.  Lucky us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now the
 crazies get to help dictate, be a central part of,  some epic inter 
religious violent melodrama, starring heroic fighters who will keep us 
safe, praise Allah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;The gamer community is always 
needing to create new ad hoc cities with detailed buildings, in multiple
 styles. Any help with generative algorithms could be a big hit.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m
 likewise seeking to blend Burning Man type &quot;tribal centers&quot; 
(experimental prototypes) into networked Country Faire vistas, suitable 
for year around camping in some cases.  Lots of food trucks / carts / 
pods ala Portland, mix of tents big and small (fractal), also domes big 
and small (a kind of tent, or yurt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Creating these vistas on computer, for fly through, gives the script more traction with would-be producers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

 Refugee Science will prove an imaginative theme park motif actually 
adds to camp prosperity, cuts down on crime. This might be in the 
vicinity of some truck stop such that supplies and transportation are in
 golf cart distance (light rail?), but the village itself is mostly 
geared for pedestrians, Disneyland style.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

One of the dumber arguments some philosophers make, is that one should
refrain from using words with well-established meanings, when inventing new
language games.  &quot;Don&#39;t recycle &lt;i&gt;pawn&lt;/i&gt; as that&#39;s spoken for.  How about &lt;i&gt;fawn&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;  They presume to steer one away from the high inertia high value
words.  That&#39;s like saying to a little kid:  &quot;don&#39;t use &lt;i&gt;gold&lt;/i&gt; in your
funny money game, as that&#39;s a real adult word, and you&#39;re just a little
kid.  Until you have real gold someday, you should say &lt;i&gt;shmold&lt;/i&gt;&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s all preamble to explaining how I see our subcultures, our dialects,
our namespaces, as only partially overlapping, because we do, in fact,
ignore these obstreperous philosophers, and use the words we want,
including &lt;i&gt;gold&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;energy&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;vector&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;radiation&lt;/i&gt; and whatever
else we might get our paws on and hold on to (I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s easy to
hold on, given precession and all that).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We all want to build for the ages, and we know that using words like &lt;i&gt;fawn&lt;/i&gt;
or &lt;i&gt;shmold&lt;/i&gt; (i.e. off-beat, never-heard-of) is going to put us at a
disadvantage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fuller gets a lot of notoriety for coining a couple words, such as &lt;i&gt;tensegrity&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in-stairs&lt;/i&gt; versus &lt;i&gt;out-stairs&lt;/i&gt; (he doesn&#39;t even take full
credit for &lt;i&gt;dymaxion&lt;/i&gt;) but really what he did most is take some high value
high inertia &quot;physics words&quot; (as if any one discipline owns them) and bend
them into his own basket-weaving language of Synergetics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tension is &quot;that which holds together&quot; (over very long distances sometimes)
whereas islands of compression (shorter range) keep stuff apart or keep
separate. Synergetics inspires lots of mental cartoons, mental imagery,
along with tactile experiences, to show us what &lt;i&gt;gravity&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;radiation&lt;/i&gt;
mean in that namespace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three rods of a tripod press down and want to splay apart (radiational) on
the slippery ice, but a triangular tension band around the base
(gravitational) keeps them from so doing.  Nothing moves, yet we appreciate
the dynamism in this equilibrium.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did he need Newton&#39;s permission to invent this new &lt;i&gt;gravity &amp;amp; precession&lt;/i&gt;
suite?  Einstein was bending space-time in new ways.  Isn&#39;t &quot;bending space&quot;
just what we do, as science minded?  We make bubbles, we subtract 720
degrees, we systematize.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hadron collision accounting (CERN stuff) and Synergetics are not &quot;at odds&quot;
so much as they co-develop as different language games (or sets thereof);
different tools, different engines.  Synergetics has a section on its
vocabulary&#39;s remoteness, which is intentional, and designed &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; to
interfere with others pursuing their own disciplines.  But, per my
preamble, he&#39;s not about to deny himself access to the gravity well of
high value words, when inking his own thinking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This idea that language boils down to names, and names point at the thing
they mean (which is &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; they mean) is not an idea I hold on to.  I let go
of that way of thinking long ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My universe therefore has room for many partially overlapping discourses
that flow downhill, like mountain streams, without needing to &quot;point&quot; to
anything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To take another example:  I cast General Systems Theory as *versus*
Economics, i.e. have GST on your resume and you&#39;re more likely to play an
intelligent role in my company.  Economics is too superstitious.  But from
another angle, we&#39;re talking about two ways of thinking that cover a lot of
the same bread and butter topics, regarding ecosystem management and so
on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spaceship maintenance.  Janitorial services, Global U.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding 2D, 1D and so on: if you see a circle (flat) or rectangle (tennis
court) in your head, where is your viewpoint?  Every line could be a
pencil, every plane a sheet of paper.  Have you ever experienced
&quot;infinitely thin&quot;?  Philosophers claim to picture it on private TV
somewhere.  Chalkboards don&#39;t help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Besides, I always have an angle on any 2D shape.  Even an infinite plane
has a position relative to mine.  I cannot myself be a 2D being, Abbott&#39;s
&lt;i&gt;Flatland&lt;/i&gt; notwithstanding, not even mentally.  I occupy volume.  Volume is
enclosed by four walls, a tetrahedron.  My Kantian idea of space, even &lt;i&gt;res cogitans&lt;/i&gt;, not just &lt;i&gt;res extensa&lt;/i&gt;, is 4D.  Four walls.  Four windows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But ya&#39;ll steeped in Cartesianism and its 3-axis octahedron of six vectors,
three basis, three not, are stuck in the a specific 3D talk.  I empathize
about the stuckness part, but readily admit to the utility of the
apparatus.  I use it too, all the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when I&#39;m wanting to communicate Synergetics, I&#39;m all about the four
windows and how anything you see on brain-TV is in a 4D studio.  I can hold
up pieces of paper and pencils and talk about all these shapes, but I have
no need of either infinite extension nor infinite thinness.  It&#39;s easier to
just see everything topological as a morphed tetrahedron, rolled flat,
rolled thin, made into a ball, whatever.  It&#39;s 4D all the way down.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;[ &lt;i&gt;originally a social media conversation with architect John Driscoll&lt;/i&gt; ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Interesting how Cybernetics 
(like Synergetics) became more twilight zone after these authors (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Alan Turing,  John von Neuman, Ross Ashby, Norbert Weiner, and Herbert Simon, Stephen Wolfram).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Like 
who champions this discipline today, or General Systems Theory for that 
matter, ala Kenneth Boulding et al?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Did computer science get sidetracked
 somehow, in failing to come together with architecture?  In addition to
 individual buildings, are the plans for camps, colonies, communities 
(bases, villages, forts) i.e. multi-structure agglomerations that might 
or might not be planned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;If planned, by what algorithms?  Fractal 
dimensions come in again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;In my science fiction 
development banking, truck stops play a big role, as hubs in a campus 
system, where citizen diplomats have opportunities for R&amp;amp;R, 
including for religious services and classes, eat, sleep, games, 
multi-functional.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;We have our standard image of what a truck stop looks
 like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are expecting all that 
trucking to become automated, however I see a rapidly growing freeway 
system from deep inside China to the Indian Ocean and Europe.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Africa
 is planning more freeways.  We need more tourism as a lifestyle, including by 
working tours of duty, involving truck driving around the world. That would 
kill two [virtual] birds, as they say.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s another way to 
see the world, while working, which we could consciously shape and 
design versus ignore as beneath our calling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why not
 have Cybernetics and General Systems Theory both come alive with global
 trucking and inter-modal transportation a central theme, unifying 
maritime architecture with land-lubber architecture?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/i&gt;, a UK-based psyops firm, with state of the art 
algorithms, tricks Facebook into divulging the data of millions (for 
which it now &lt;a href=&quot;https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/facebook-cambridge-analytica.html&quot;&gt;faces fines&lt;/a&gt;). Bannon is vice president, working closely

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took my eye off the ball today, when Carol went to purchase a ballpoint pen.&amp;nbsp; Rather than shuffle along behind her, I decided to hit the Cork &amp;amp; Tap on the first floor, for a single pint.&amp;nbsp; We reunited and headed over to Powell&#39;s, on foot, but there she didn&#39;t seem to have her wallet.&amp;nbsp; Uh oh.&amp;nbsp; She must have lost it when my back was turned (figuratively).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The punch line is she did have her wallet but just didn&#39;t reach for it enough.&amp;nbsp; The walker has a pouch that hangs in front.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d been home and to several cashier stations, making inquiries.&amp;nbsp; The day had turned bleak, as I realized we&#39;d need to cancel her bank card or whatever.&amp;nbsp; A pleasant outing had turned gray.&amp;nbsp; These turns don&#39;t usually get to me but...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s a big ugly world out their churning too, and so I did indulge in some despair.&amp;nbsp; But fortunately I didn&#39;t bottle it up, and found ways to release the pressure.&amp;nbsp; I still consider myself sloppy though, as I could have easily found the wallet had I really looked.&amp;nbsp; Second guessing in the rear view mirror.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, I&#39;m worried about all the craziness, from Julian Assange, to Flint (new movie coming), to Venezuela, to the Refugee Science we may need to invent.&amp;nbsp; What have our universities been planning all this time?&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t actually plan, they teach planners.&amp;nbsp; The planners go to work for city, county and state governments.&amp;nbsp; Does Oregon State have any thoughts about refugees?&amp;nbsp; I know there&#39;s a tight legal meaning wrapped around that word, that wouldn&#39;t cover homeless on the streets of Portland.&amp;nbsp; But then there&#39;s also English.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re acting like the humanitarian crisis we need to solve is somewhere far away.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m seeing a need to up the level of conversation, meaning sharing more intelligent data.&amp;nbsp; I realize it&#39;s up to me to look for sources.&amp;nbsp; I can&#39;t expect everything to just fall in my lap.&amp;nbsp; But then I don&#39;t have a real job description when it comes to Refugee Science, other than I&#39;ve been working on GST as a counter to the more oblivious forms of Economics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Quakers seem to be coming around to my &quot;military socialism&quot; characterization, which I admit works pretty well for some families.&amp;nbsp; Some of those housing units on Okinawa look pretty spiffy, and those aren&#39;t even the high ranking officer accommodations.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m just finding so little willingness to bend away from rigid adherence to yesteryear&#39;s ways of talking.&amp;nbsp; People get stuck in a rut.&amp;nbsp; Me too.&lt;/div&gt;

We&#39;re bracing for a next attack, a round of sanctions maybe.&amp;nbsp; Like Canada, we&#39;re out from under, a Free State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However saying they&#39;ll flood our cities with refugees (trial balloon) is less of a threat than they think.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ve had influxes before and know that higher ed has a role.&amp;nbsp; The difference between &quot;camp&quot; and &quot;campus&quot; is minute.&amp;nbsp; Yes, we enjoyed a friendlier Feds back then.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I worked with CUE, which started out under Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon.&amp;nbsp; For awhile, we were free flying, until refugees were no longer a priority.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was in the aftermath of Nixon-Kissinger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I taped a Youtube about our role, with some mention of past AFSC work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;m on an unplanned Adam Curtis kick, a marathon, starting with &lt;i&gt;The Century of the Self&lt;/i&gt;, and moving on to &lt;i&gt;Hypernormalization&lt;/i&gt;, but remembering &lt;i&gt;The Power of Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;earlier blog posts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watching a lot of the same style in one go is to become aware of the thematic backdrops, impressive skyscraper vistas, which scream two messages:&amp;nbsp; planned and unplanned.&amp;nbsp; The narrator holds to a dialectic between chaos, and politics losing all ability to shape events, versus some renewed sense of hope in a new managerial philosophy, which then inevitably falls by the wayside.&amp;nbsp; The crashing of waves on a beach comes to mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The style is one of reverie, with the narrator sometimes leaving us to interpret for ourselves the blizzard of images, or maybe just a few.&amp;nbsp; The music and other soundtrack, as distinct from the narrator track, is also impressive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These movies tell stories, I think effectively, and so take their place as potentially reality-shaping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I mention in my earlier blog posts &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/04/documentary-city.html&quot;&gt;of today&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2019/04/on-first-day.html&quot;&gt;yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, although I was caught up in Occupy Portland,&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t have a strong sense of how it connected to any events in the Middle East.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not saying there weren&#39;t connections, only that I wasn&#39;t doing anything to influence events there, nor aware of people around me doing so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where &lt;i&gt;Hypernomalization&lt;/i&gt; is into connecting dots, I&#39;m sometimes not making the same connections.&amp;nbsp; However I do like connections-making narratives, so if we focus on different dots, that&#39;s not a criticism on my part.&amp;nbsp; I learn from some stuff I&#39;ve been missing.&amp;nbsp; Like I&#39;d forgotten, if I ever knew, Qaddafi got to stay in a tent on a Trump property that time.&amp;nbsp; Both were into getting publicity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The angle on Nine Eleven (911) is to focus on the sense of foreboding and literal foreshadowing leading up to those events in 2001.&amp;nbsp; Syria is a core focus.&amp;nbsp; The arc is vengeance for Kissinger&#39;s betrayal, in terms of never planning a real future for national boundaries.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not saying the movie blames Syria-Iran, having argued effectively that reality is plastic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we get around to the Russians, it&#39;s as if they&#39;ve invented &quot;reality shaping&quot; all over again. We&#39;ve had the Vienna Circle, through the Freuds (including Anna) telling us to tame the id through conformity, or, through the human potential movements (e.g. &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt;) channel it to overturn and reinvent a stultifying earlier reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Either way (whether for controlling or unleashing), politics is projected for (and by?) a collective unconscious, an irrational side.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m venturing into &lt;i&gt;Self&lt;/i&gt; episodes, having seen those last night.&amp;nbsp; But then we&#39;re supposed to believe the Russians suddenly came to similar conclusions only after the USSR had faded?&amp;nbsp; Or does every generation discover these same truths?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the sight of God, no nations may exist, except in the minds of little humans, post Babel (I&#39;m getting Biblical).&amp;nbsp; But that&#39;s where it (existence) most matters (in peoples&#39; beliefs).&amp;nbsp; One doesn&#39;t dismiss something as not existing by saying that thing is widely believed in.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s not a recognized logic or rhetorical device.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The youth of cyber-America don&#39;t have any real solutions once technology gets them to show up in large numbers.&amp;nbsp; They stand around going duh.&amp;nbsp; Lets be practical though:&amp;nbsp; OPDX in downtown Portland was not sustainable.&amp;nbsp; We had an experiment in self management.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The people threw a big party, coming in from Beaverton and all around, a kind of victory celebration, very nonviolent, after which the leadership was happy to call it a day.&amp;nbsp; Now of course &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/10/halloween-2011-1-of-3.html&quot;&gt;the leadership&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is oxymoronic in anarchic situations, and I&#39;d be one of the first to admit that. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of the day, I&#39;m prone to marvel at the same tenuous picture of a creature with free will, somehow left adrift to figure a way forward in ways crows and cattle don&#39;t have to worry about.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been given this gift of a big intellect, and we&#39;re still not sure what it&#39;s for, after all this time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly, our big intellect suggests we&#39;re here on Planet Earth to tackle some big problems, and before we start sounding hopeless lets at least take note of some abilities, some track record.&amp;nbsp; Yes, we&#39;ve done a lot to disappoint Freud and lead people of conscience and insight to despair for the human animal.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve already admitted to a streak of misanthropy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These films keep circling around that same conundrum, of in what sense is humanity free and is there a constructive, intelligent way to exercise this freedom, insofar as it exists?&amp;nbsp; The question seems apropos, but points to an unsettled science, or to philosophy in other words.&lt;/div&gt;

&amp;nbsp;If you don&#39;t wanna hype outward war, &lt;i&gt;or&lt;/i&gt; legal drugs either, what good are you, as a blogger, or as a participant in our economic give and take?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/drug-pushers.html&quot;&gt;Drug dealers&lt;/a&gt; have a bottom line, like everyone else.&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;If you&#39;re reaching a significant number of eyeballs, you should take our message to the public.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re not asking you to push our press releases, just let us buy commercials on your show.&amp;nbsp; Be a good capitalist already, and let us push our products.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

Meanwhile, it&#39;s the news that&#39;s insane. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The second video references the first, with both shot on April 1, two years apart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first, entitled &lt;i&gt;Bucky&#39;s Subconscious Demon&lt;/i&gt;, is based on a quote from Synergetics that arises amidst Fuller&#39;s recounting the story of his Volume Five.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second video, which dances around the same subjects, shows how Python, the computer language, fits in to the puzzle.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Concentric Hierarchy Generator&lt;/i&gt; shows off a generator that spits back the familiar volumes table Americans all learn by heart in school (not).&lt;br /&gt;

Absent energy to keep Math Forum going, I suppose &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/from-the-underground-railroad-93390c678891&quot;&gt;the Math Wars went underground&lt;/a&gt; to some extent. Visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/forum.jspa?forumID=206&amp;amp;start=0&quot;&gt;Forum 206&lt;/a&gt; and extrapolate somehow, if you wish to get a better sense of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of the issue:&amp;nbsp; climate change active youth are less likely to stand for wasteful wood pulp textbook rackets if the PR doesn&#39;t find a way to offset the impression the dead tree ghettos are not privileged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;d been decrying the heavy book bag culture for years, on similar environmental grounds, but I wasn&#39;t surrounded by activists back then.&amp;nbsp; This next generation is ready to fight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of the currents were not of my making.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t invent &quot;charter school&quot; as distinct from a &quot;school with no charter&quot; as two breeds of tax funded institution.&amp;nbsp; Portland&#39;s charters didn&#39;t get buildings.&amp;nbsp; They had to forage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that Franklin and soon Grant are rebuilt, better constructed to withstand earthquakes, there&#39;s a spreading sense we need to be more like Tokyo and rebuild lots of blocks.&amp;nbsp; Those hoping to hold on to Old Portland, at least in some areas, have the tourism industry on their side, or at least I would hope so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My last couple Youtubes have been about not overselling the Oregon Curriculum Network product.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t have magic pills and I&#39;m not advertising I will do any makeovers on the people.&amp;nbsp; The cast is whoever shows up.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m more into props and supplies, keeping options open.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;ll remember I was reaching out to Turkey here and there.&amp;nbsp; I tend to see Truckers for Peace as working in tandem with any truck stop ethos involving strong links to higher ed.&amp;nbsp; The Coffee Shops Network is about spreading the practice of philanthropy.&amp;nbsp; OCN is more about conventional learning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The &quot;dot operator&quot; is ubiquitous in programming, but weren&#39;t these languages supposed to extend logic as well as mathematics, in philosophy?&amp;nbsp; Yes, electrons flooded in an animated these new notations from the inside.&amp;nbsp; We had new ways to channel energy, to shape it into computations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fast forward and it&#39;s time to pass the torch to coming generations.&amp;nbsp; However, curricula have bottle-necked and in many cases tanked.&amp;nbsp; I network with my people, as best I can, to come up with something more designed, more attuned to present needs.&amp;nbsp; That means casting the &quot;dot operator&quot; as an operator &quot;within math&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Where the Polyhedrons live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last night I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/operators-harbingers-of-the-zeitgeist-89fe9f4764b3&quot;&gt;a story on Medium&lt;/a&gt; recalling the politicization of the math curriculum in the 1920s.&amp;nbsp; Anti-German sentiments were motivating textbook publishers to purge some of the existing Number Theory, according to a reliable source.&amp;nbsp; Looking up to some guy named Gauss wouldn&#39;t do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Barriers to &quot;Gnu Math&quot; have been different.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a wish to keep K-12 mathematics recognizable by not mixing in much code.&amp;nbsp; However, if code &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; enter the picture, then why not usher in the dot operator of object oriented language fame?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we&#39;re going to have &quot;math objects&quot; we might reach into, through the dot, then why not &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/03/box-oriented-programming-bop.html&quot;&gt;have these be polyhedrons&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Cast polyhedrons as the paradigm objects to which &quot;the dot&quot; gives us access.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps the only new idea here is to keep calling it math even after we&#39;ve automated it to such a degree as to be using electronics i.e. computers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick and I wandered on Mt. Tabor today, with Quinn the dog.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m fine with flights of stairs and all that.&amp;nbsp; Patrick has been playing with a certain Kali Linux, &quot;a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Sounds interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;d like to be paid to learn stuff I could then turn around and teach in some value-adding manner.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what an edit-recombine PWS does in the GST ecosystem:&amp;nbsp; it adds value.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Making polyhedrons the generic object in object oriented programming, in a math curriculum context, is a way to bring more coding skills into the picture, without waiting for CS to pave the way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The attempt to boot up CS (computer science) in every high school, as its own track with its own faculty, whereas mathematics is already under pressure to be more relevant, is a mistake we might all learn from.&amp;nbsp; Lets hope South Africa doesn&#39;t make the mistake of copying Texas.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4_cP_vKCoI&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Towards the end of the embedded video, I say &quot;Happy Pi Day&quot; in a talk balloon, when Ramanujan&#39;s likeness appears, on a stamp facsimile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ramanujan came up with some amazing equations, &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/01/testing-math-ml.html&quot;&gt;some of them involving pi&lt;/a&gt;, which Hardy really wanted to see proved.&amp;nbsp; Short of proof, extended precision number types give us ways to investigate what is claimed.&amp;nbsp; I have some Jupyter Notebooks devoted to that topic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also allude to March 14 being an anniversary of Stephen Hawking&#39;s death.&amp;nbsp; I think birthdays are usually considered happier occasions, deaths more solemn, OK I&#39;ll say it, more grave.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s an undertone of mourning for Synergetics too, which never made it into schools, much as the Concentric Hierarchy of Nested Polyhedrons is Sesame Street simple.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one nests polyhedrons anymore, ever since Kepler&#39;s stack failed to jibe with the solar system in any precise fashion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those seeking literal truths are more easily disappointed, whereas &quot;as above so below&quot; is really about &quot;analogies across scale&quot; (a topic I begin to address in the embedded Youtube).&amp;nbsp; Angle and frequency are separable aspects (shape and size).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I advance the thesis that the high priest language currently centers on &quot;whatsons&quot;, especially bosons, the God particle in particular, whereas &quot;thinking about thinking&quot; (philosophy) is considered a relatively stale (as in marginalized) set of language games.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CERN stuff is center ring.&amp;nbsp; It gave us hypertext as another internet protocol (HTTP), recently celebrated this month in the media &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/news/367077/happy-birthday-internet-the-world-wide-web-turns-30&quot;&gt;for turning thirty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The initially remote vocabulary of Synergetics, with its &quot;quantum modules&quot;, was indeed becoming more of a swirling vortex, as particle physics found uses for many of the same names (&quot;spin&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These namespaces became neighbors, with Fuller thinking up a six-edged model for a proton-neutron Feynman diagram.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe some schooling in Synergetics will help one memorize the standard model?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How about organic chemistry?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How does one apply &quot;spherical thinking&quot; in either case?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was up by 4 AM, deciding to make my daily Youtube earlier rather than later.  Carol had set her alarm for more like 6:30 AM, given she intended to attend this Wanderers meetup, about the Green New Deal and its relationship to the UN Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was in chauffeur mode for this one, unable to take the indoor lifestyle of a round table discussion.&amp;nbsp; They talked for two hours.&amp;nbsp; Between tours outside, including to the tax company down the street, I would sip coffee and listen to the conversation.&amp;nbsp; Carol managed to get her words in edge-wise, as a respected elder and storyteller.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes I just don&#39;t have opinions I consider worth something and/or any patience for politics.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m more the dumb animal, the ox or lion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The tax office had a &lt;i&gt;Time&lt;/i&gt; article about the Dalai Lama and Tibet, which I perused.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mused on the impact of Tibetan culture on my own life, which has been considerable, especially if one takes in the Tantric and Vajrayana subcultures of Bhutan (a family home for a spell) and Nepal.&amp;nbsp; The Newar temple around the corner from the Linus Pauling House has also had ripple effects in my life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I first started tuning in Tibetan culture in a big way when I was still living in Jersey City.&amp;nbsp; At this point, I had no inkling that my parents would be moving to Thimphu.&amp;nbsp; Sometime later, I would be Alan Potkin&#39;s best man for the Buddhist wedding ceremony in our living room in Druk-yul (the Dragon Kingdom).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Driscoll, the architect, was present, after many months of absence from Portland.&amp;nbsp; Our presenter, Pat Haynes, on the other hand, was on the verge of leaving the west coast for the east, for an indefinite period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John phoned after I got mom home and we (Glenn, Don, John and I) adjourned to &lt;i&gt;Pepinos&lt;/i&gt; for lunch. &lt;/div&gt;

These videos back-to-back show one way to lower a ladder to the younger set, just getting into academic subjects.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this &quot;thoughts for the day&quot; video, I challenge the stereotype that a &quot;globalist&quot; is interested in some New World Order featuring some one world government.  That we have one world, in the sense of planet, is indisputable (OK, maybe &quot;have&quot; is the wrong word -- it has us), but there&#39;s no one world government today.  Lets focus on the cybernetic truths of the present moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, what I bring up instead are &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/01/cyber-nations.html&quot;&gt;&quot;virtual nations&quot;&lt;/a&gt; or &quot;diaspora nations&quot;.&amp;nbsp; A lot of would-be nations failed to luck out, or had their native lands stolen from them.&amp;nbsp; Rather than read these out of history, doesn&#39;t it make more sense to include them?&amp;nbsp; We already have supranational corporations, and world religions.&amp;nbsp; Humans self organize on many &quot;levels&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although the battle lines were drawn, and the nationalists were keen to intimate that the globalists were the bad guys, no debate really happened.&amp;nbsp; That a globalist has to be some billionaire oligarch is also highly questionable.&amp;nbsp; Why do we settle for the &quot;for dummies&quot; version of everything?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

What&#39;s going on here?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m inserting myself into an ongoing debate, but at a different frequency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The global grid is not just a Chinese idea.&amp;nbsp; You need to tune out an important chapter in Western Civ, namely World Game, to think so.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what historians have been doing:&amp;nbsp; tuning us out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chinese and Russians enjoy playing World Game with us, because we&#39;ve done our homework. &lt;br /&gt;

I haven&#39;t chronicled a Wanderers meetup in awhile.&amp;nbsp; Tonight&#39;s had all the elements.&amp;nbsp; Or at least the more unstable ones.&amp;nbsp; I will explain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dick Pugh, the former high school physics teachers, &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/12/meteor-man.html&quot;&gt;meteor man&lt;/a&gt;, and sometime before that, a worker on top secret projects for government labs, also known as the Manhattan Project.&amp;nbsp; He launched into his well-rehearsed lecture on radioactive decay, through all the byproducts.&amp;nbsp; Isotopes anyone?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used a pause to interject &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/03/corporation-meeting.html&quot;&gt;Hugh Thomforde&#39;s story&lt;/a&gt; of going to the Cook Islands to share about pearl farming.&amp;nbsp; The locals seemed interested until he mentioned the pearls would need to form around&amp;nbsp; &quot;nuclei&quot;.&amp;nbsp; They suddenly lost all interest, thinking he was starting down that ugly path. Hugh had to further &quot;disambiguate&quot; as we say on Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dick went on with the radioactive decay lecture (shades of Asimov).&amp;nbsp; I remembered I needed to buy fish and ducked out through the back door to grab the last sockeye salmon fillet.&amp;nbsp; I was back in my chair before anyone missed me. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The history books say Japan was the only country nuked, forgetting the fact that the US nuked itself, over and over, and yes, with people there.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the people were put there on purpose.&amp;nbsp; Who knew that lithium might get involved in the chain reaction?&amp;nbsp; The Bikini explosion was a bit more than was planned for.&amp;nbsp; Even the mainland got nuked, many locals irradiated, although not on the scale of &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/remembering.html&quot;&gt;Nagasaki and Hiroshima&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The long and short term health effects on Americans in the vicinity was all a part of the experiment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After &lt;i&gt;Doctor Strangelove&lt;/i&gt; came out, the word went around the circuits Dick was in (top secret) to keep quiet about it. No comments were welcome.&amp;nbsp; What was eerie about that film was the cockpit sequence, wherein they had the whole procedure realistically displayed.&amp;nbsp; Dick said they&#39;d redacted some of those parts, in later editions of the movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We talked about other topics of course.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/09/fall-equinox-celebration.html&quot;&gt;Barbara&lt;/a&gt; brought up the &lt;a href=&quot;http://deathtalkproject.com/pdx-death-cafe/&quot;&gt;PDX Death Café events&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp; &quot;At a Death Café people drink tea, eat cake and discuss death. Our aim is
 to increase awareness of death to help people make the most of their 
(finite) lives.&quot;&amp;nbsp; How would you like to be remembered?&amp;nbsp; What were your accomplishments and so on?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been looking back on some of that myself, doing a retrospective set of videos.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/from-the-underground-railroad-93390c678891&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;From the Underground Railroad&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is my latest attempt to encapsulate what I&#39;ve been up to, all these years.&amp;nbsp; At sixty, I&#39;m statistically likely to get some more years, but that&#39;s never a promise or guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Francher has been reading &lt;i&gt;24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep &lt;/i&gt;and gave us a synopsis. I see I can get it for my Kindle for $10, however I recently split for &lt;i&gt;Safari Books&lt;/i&gt; and might have reached the end of my reading budget.&amp;nbsp; Besides, I&#39;m still plowing through the free Gutenberg Press version of H. G. Wells, on &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/02/riddle-of-peace.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washington and the Riddle of Peace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/05/memorial-day.html&quot;&gt;Don&#39;s boat &lt;i&gt;Meliptus&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; almost went down last night.  A leak around the exhaust pipe went undetected until he was back to the boathouse and about the close down.  He heard the aft bilge pump working.  That was his cue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After stuffing a towel in the hole, he managed to turn the boat around and hoist it up be its rear (no room at the gas dock). Had he not heard the pump, it very likely would have sank to the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;

Steve was into a lot of projects besides the polyhedrons these videos are about.  I was not a collaborator on these projects.  Many besides myself worked on the Waterman Polyhedrons.&amp;nbsp; I was maybe the first to promulgate the term &quot;Waterman Polyhedron&quot; (Steve was too modest to do that himself).&lt;br /&gt;

Time to call AAA, but was my membership up to date?&amp;nbsp; I feared not as my wallet card had expired.&amp;nbsp; However, the good news is I was paid up and membership services switched me over to the jump starter crews, by way of dispatching (why we&#39;re here in &lt;i&gt;Control Room&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Android (smartphone) was meanwhile at death&#39;s door on the charger and not up to taking calls.&amp;nbsp; I kept looking out the front door so as not to miss the AAA business mobile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The battery bounced back with sufficient infusion from the car&#39;s internal recharging system, petrol powered.&amp;nbsp; We joked about the mountain of World Cup soccer balls in my front yard (the C6XTY sculpture).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AAA&#39;s parting advice was to take the car on a journey, an adventure, off the beaten path (I added that last bit).&amp;nbsp; I invited Carol but she&#39;d rather just stick to the original itinerary post test drive.&amp;nbsp; I took the Nissan to FuBonn, the giant (&quot;&quot;) Asian mall (biggest Asian mall in Portland) and stocked up on noodles and some international beers (Myanmar and Singha).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The 1997 sedan performed well, having a newly rebuilt underneath.&amp;nbsp; Melody&#39;s rig had gotten that same way when she got hers redone in Olympia, not even risking it to Portland where repairs were planned.&amp;nbsp; You need a strong rig if heading over the ridge to California.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In between all this car talk, I&#39;ve been pumping out some new &quot;U200bs&quot; as I call them, again inventing my own slang.&amp;nbsp; Hashtag hashtag.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ll end with a flashback to the Superbowl on NFL Day, an event in Atlanta in the opulent Southwest. I started watching the preshow at &lt;i&gt;Hop House&lt;/i&gt; with Glenn, then raced over to &lt;i&gt;Cork &amp;amp; Tap&lt;/i&gt; (the formal name) for a growler refill while still happy hour.&amp;nbsp; But they&#39;d extended it.&amp;nbsp; I stuck around for an IPA then headed home with some groceries.&amp;nbsp; I ended at Derek&#39;s place where he used the kitchen to bake our pizza.&amp;nbsp; I brought the growler but we stuck to coffee.&amp;nbsp; All of this going around was on foot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Python 3.8 has been released to the curious testers and I&#39;m tempted to grab a copy.&amp;nbsp; Python is under active development and isn&#39;t expected to contort as it did when we jumped from 2.x to 3.x -- a jump announced well in advance and managed bravely.&amp;nbsp; The was to work out a few kinks in the first iteration and shift the language to a more comfortable long term form.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m glad AAA was able to respond quickly, and also that the event was not a roadside emergency, or getting stranded in a parking lot downtown, again with Carol as I recall.&amp;nbsp; I blogged that event too, and others before it.&lt;/div&gt;
