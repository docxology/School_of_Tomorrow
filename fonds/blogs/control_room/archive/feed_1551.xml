&lt;br /&gt;
Back in the 1980s/90s I was suggesting a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/makeover0.html&quot;&gt;makeover&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, then as now a popular genre on TV (plastic surgery channel, or just playing dress up). But the downside of such a meme is its &quot;purely cosmetic&quot; spin, inapplicable as that connotation may well be in specialcase.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the new campaign uses words like &quot;reboot&quot; more often, while keeping &quot;makeover&quot; as a runner up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Central to the reboot is this new focus on energy. We have Sol (our sun) like 92 million miles distant, as a primary source, and the relative vacuum of space (out past the orbiting junk heap) as our energy source. In between is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Into-Cool-Energy-Flow-Thermodynamics/dp/0226739376/&quot;&gt;Dorion Sagan&lt;/a&gt; and others call the &quot;solar gradient&quot;, which humanity rides kind of like a beach bum rides a surf board, piggy-backing on this vast tsunami of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html&quot;&gt;energy income&lt;/a&gt; courtesy of what Pharoh Akhenaten recognized as our biggest physical energy sponsor in these parts, to the tune of many terawatts per capita over an average lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What we then do is break this energy down into cycles, mainly the shorter swing weather cycles within the longer swing climate cycles, and our ability to tap in to those with &quot;water wheel&quot; technology, meaning these turbine like things (or literal turbines), feeding into the various distribution grids to the offices and homes and such, where the voltage is stepped down to like 220/110 at 50/60 cycles (visit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geni.org/&quot;&gt;geni.org&lt;/a&gt; for more info).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The mathematics comes in early, as we attach precise and engineeringly significant numbers to this picture, using spreadsheets, computer simulations or whatever you school curriculum experts have signed up for (as a parent, you may be downloading or purchasing at Fry&#39;s -- make sure you push for that homeschooler tax deduction as these supplies needn&#39;t be paid for twice). Solar gradient kwhs convert to grid kwhs which in turn convert to calories and kilocalories, joules and kilojoules. This is where we get to the food labels and the whole &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/&quot;&gt;Super Size Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; discussion around malnutrition (over as well as under -- an important component of any serious-minded public spirited self health curriculum, and just as appropriate under the heading of math).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course by now the purists are starting to object about all the french fries and milk shakes we&#39;re discussing, taking seriously as solar gradient income (hydrocarbons cycle). This sounds more like science class. But your counter, as one of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/search?q=%22gnu+math%22&quot;&gt;gnu math&lt;/a&gt;&quot; trained, is to remind parents that &quot;geometry&quot; is really &quot;earth measure&quot; and said earth is an actual planet, ours, Earth or Spaceship Earth as your text may call it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re not using K-12 as a platform to promote some psychological &quot;disconnect&quot; from the &quot;real world&quot; ala some of the negative press about Ivory Tower PhD level math (much of it undeserved). That&#39;s not a goal. Pursue that brand of necromancy in college or in private scholarship if you like, but don&#39;t take it as a sign of weakness that we&#39;re anchored in the astronomical and geological data bases, when it comes to getting our most primitive concepts across. We&#39;re not about turning our back on Animal Planet. The object oriented paradigm (OOP), intrinsic to our self-executing math notations, is especially vested in animals and animation, per the various geek-architected pipelines already well described in this Math Forum archive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, don&#39;t therefore misassume we don&#39;t have proofs. Our grounding in real world open source energy planning type curricula does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; mean we&#39;re unable to justify and/or prove the logical consistency of our approach, by a lot of the same means used by the competition i.e. by those otherworldly philosopher types, steeped in their continuum metaphysics ala the calculus. Discrete math engineering, at the higher levels, is well typified by such texts as &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/brainstorming-about-pedagogy.html&quot;&gt;Concrete Mathematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; (sometimes used at Stanford) and Donald Knuth&#39;s &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/%7Eknuth/taocp.html&quot;&gt;The Art of Computer Programming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. We&#39;re not apologetic for our more digital spin, think it flies, carries water, plus leads to interesting careers for our grads. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;

Now, six years later, she works for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.americorps.org/&quot;&gt;AmeriCorps&lt;/a&gt; and has friends like family. I salute her &quot;courage to be&quot; as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.escapefromwatchtower.com/tilground.html&quot;&gt;Paul Tillich&lt;/a&gt; would put it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wanderer &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/10/market-research.html&quot;&gt;Patrick Barton&lt;/a&gt; swung by 4D Studios for some wasabi peas, salmon jerky and beer.

Because of these things, we were enabled to experience a great healing in the wake of Dawn&#39;s life, an act of lovingkindness and a contribution to us all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humanity, bending technology to humane uses, has the potential to do well for itself, to alleviate suffering, to work, to enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ask that I remain open to Mother Nature as a teacher for me, and as one who assigns me tasks.

Alexia fell asleep before it was over, Tara pronounced it a good movie and not all that bad, given she empathized so completely with Ofelia. Dawn had wanted to see this movie, given the title and buzz. In retrospect, we think she did fine without it -- but not that it was a bad movie or anything, just very violent (recalling her reaction to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/lost-city-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Lost City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). Plus Dawn didn&#39;t much go for subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film explores very strongly motivated characters each responding to a different set of cues. The little girl is the most off base, in terms of having a solid enough reality to walk through walls (in a manner of speaking).

Civilian fuel providers will contract with Iranian refineries for ready-to-install non-weapons-grade materials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given an historic insistence on secrecy coupled with a policy of first use, LAWCAP is in no position to be lecturing on the need for transparency in monitoring.

USA-based flagships could remain competitive however, if complying with the same IAEA-style transparency guidelines as everyone else.

The Chicago connection was about to fall through, and Seattle is too far to taxi, but an alert desk clerk realized a certain aircraft ended the day in Portland, so if Alexia just sat it out, passing through places like San Diego and Phoenix, she&#39;d make it after all, which she did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bag though. It came through Chicago, and I picked it up this morning with Larry, blathering in both directions about geeky stuff (they&#39;d&#39;ve delivered but why not a $50 voucher, a chance to catch up with a friend?). Anyway, great airline work. And kudos to Greg by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mercy care team is also in high gear, performing its services. I just got off the phone with Ellen where she talked me through resetting the pump. Any TPN during hospice is a matter of landing the craft slowly and comfortably, less of a crash -- a shot of whiskey on the deck of &lt;em&gt;The Titanic&lt;/em&gt; is how I put it (except Dawn was more a tequila fan, had given up drinking by the time I met her).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gayle and Elizabeth were her two pilgrimmage sisters on that trip to Ireland&#39;s holy wells that time. She also flew on her own to Glastonbury and those parts, that other time, meeting up with sisters there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn was first introduced to the Kirby concept in the abstract. She was shown a small closet like room, told it was my office, while meanwhile Kirby himself was in Bhutan. Which was all true. Later, she and Alexia went to Bhutan with me, by way of Chang Mai (Thailand) and Calcutta (India).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1547143&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;Math Wars&lt;/a&gt;, they&#39;re always ongoing.

Plus I take &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; credit (not a whole lot) for getting those trekkie monikers applied to brands of Washington insider in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, I used the term &quot;Vulcan&quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.org.cia/browse_thread/thread/5338367d6b87d277/bc7af3743d5182ae?lnk=st&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rnum=1&amp;amp;hl=en#bc7af3743d5182ae&quot;&gt;May of 1999&lt;/a&gt; with reference to the CIA&#39;s former executive director &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessweek.com/1996/09/b3464116.htm&quot;&gt;Nora Slatkin&lt;/a&gt;, her tenure overlapping Deutch&#39;s as then DCI:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nora came from a background in defense, as did DCI Deutch. Some of us called her &quot;the Vulcan Queen&quot; or something like that. She was a tough cookie -- smart too.&lt;/blockquote&gt;But in calling her a Vulcan, I never intended Slatkin to be perceived as a neocon, who are more like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sjtrek.com/trek/rules/&quot;&gt;Ferengi&lt;/a&gt; (I don&#39;t really see Condi as a neocon either though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; talk led a Thirster from LA to talk about being one of the very few privileged enough to get on the &lt;em&gt;Deep Space Nine&lt;/em&gt; set. I&#39;d been talking about how Kirk&#39;s chair in the Paul Allen museum would never pass muster on HDTV (you only need detail to the limit of scan line or pixel density).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Deep Space&lt;/em&gt; set was pretty detailed, but did contain Easter Eggs you&#39;d never see on TV, such as &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://imdb.com/title/tt0057751/&quot;&gt;Gilligan&#39;s Island&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; lyrics on one of the space station&#39;s monitors (but &quot;the real&quot; &lt;em&gt;Deep Space&lt;/em&gt; might&#39;ve had those too, having a shared Earthian past).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More remarkable were the garish colors. What you need to do with color, to make stuff look good on television, is kinda odd sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Thirsters, Lew assured me Gore&#39;s global warming road show rivaled the very best of the ISEPP lectures, and received high marks from the public. Lew compares Gore to Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould, even if Gore&#39;s scientific credentials are more humble than theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lew himself is way above average, in terms of being scientifically literate, but then he&#39;s a Wanderer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Wanderers, Linus Pauling might be another role model, though I was assured yesterday that if you really took as much vitamin C as LP recommends, you&#39;d generate some nasty Fe3+ oxidants, so better not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred was going on about how the Irish really took it in the neck for awhile.

Kids don&#39;t want to always re-enter the same passwords on a personal computer, a tedious exercise if you&#39;re not worried about spying on yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a browser typically comes with privacy controls, meaning cookies get blocked by default, meaning it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll be rescued from tedium, unless you know how to tell your browser from which domains cookies&#39;ll be OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s up to you, the user, to set these policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we throw kids into this virtual &quot;oval office,&quot; surrounded with nifty freedoms, and then don&#39;t give &#39;em a clue. You get to be President Klutzo, some superhero Incredible who can&#39;t figure out how to work the netmeeting phone, drive the golf cart or whatever. What a wasted opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you&#39;d think math teachers, being the numeracy gurus in our culture, for little kids anyway, our having banned real geeks from actually teaching anything so elementary, except maybe on some exotic satellite channels you may be lucky enough to be getting, would be the ones to share this lore -- about how to allow cookies from Google, for example, but not from some fly by night with only a number, not even a DNS sig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, well maybe the language arts teachers then? Actually that sounds about right, as XML and the DOM signify tree structures, like those old Outlines we used to do, with Roman Numeral major sections, like chapters, broken down into maybe a, b, c each with subsections i, ii, iii and so on, however the notation (this was all before those graphical &quot;bullets&quot; became available). Given language teachers already need to cover XML, why not let &#39;em handle the cookies part too?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5876525913898816303'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5876525913898816303'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/why-no-cookies-in-math-class.html' title='Why No Cookies in Math Class?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-8602517113048389998</id><published>2007-02-25T09:10:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-05-23T23:44:55.314-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Burden of Dreams (movie review)</title><content type='html'>This is the movie that goes with Werner Herzog&#39;s director&#39;s commentary track &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/01/fitzcarraldo-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Fitzcarraldo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Werner plays himself as a crazed film maker, willing to risk life and limb (others&#39; as much as his own) to get those special effects only obtainable if you do them for real.

Or if behind, then presumably you&#39;re on the other side? Would that be outside or in? On a &lt;em&gt;ball&lt;/em&gt;, a triangular walled city is really just an interface between &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; cities, both with three corners and three edges. Remember, Earth is a ball. Tale of two cities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, so on my flag is this MITE, for Minimum Tetrahedron, and some initials &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1537020&amp;amp;tstart=15&quot;&gt;RBF&lt;/a&gt;. We say minimal because tetrahedral but also because not handed: the right handed and left handed, inside out versions of one another, look the same. Then they fill space with no gaps, in terms of Couplers we might cast it, in our model of the IVM (a kind of holodeck for Scenarios Universe, our &quot;show and tells,&quot; partially overlapping, eternally regenerative). Handed modules would be like the As and Bs, which comprise the MITEs but, &lt;em&gt;like&lt;/em&gt; the left and right handed Ls in &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt;, can&#39;t just stand in for one another as substitutes (&quot;some inside-outing required&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took Carla and Scott on a mostly driving tour while Dawn underwent alternative therapies today. We left the GPS in the other car (their rental), so driving by feel, I approached Council Crest, only to veer around behind to Scholls Ferry (a road I&#39;d haunted the day before, in service of my alma mater), winding to Hwy 24, into town via Rose Garden (made two passes at Portlandia), back under the cable car on I-5 to Humdinger on Barbur (near Dawn) thence to Grand Central Bakery in Multnomah Village, by way of old haunts (this was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/blog&quot;&gt;Matt&#39;s and my&lt;/a&gt; early boyhood neighborhood, pre Rome, my Markham Annex now a corporate campus, &lt;em&gt;Piggly Wiggly&lt;/em&gt; gone too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool interlude: we parked Razz at the Oregon Zoo lot and rode the Max elevator down to the station, hundreds of feet below through layers of sediment. Set into stone in this station is one vertical core sample, laid horizontally in a tube, with engravings suggestive of the millions of years that have elapsed, over the time of this core deposit&#39;s aggregating. Two trains arrived while we inspected the exhibit, one bound for Gresham (to the east) the other for Hillsboro (to the west).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Dawn rejoined us (chauffered by Peg), we proceeded to the Chinese Garden, which the three enjoyed, as I took Razz over the Steel for some gas. Scott and Carla fly home tomorrow. She works in an Italian restaurant. Her boy Steve wants to pit for NASCAR and like that (a worthy goal I&#39;d hazard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was OMSI, fruit smoothies.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3345213333517490869'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3345213333517490869'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/standards-and-ramparts.html' title='Standards and Ramparts'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-5437030684293919979</id><published>2007-02-18T13:07:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-15T02:36:51.179-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Control Room Collection</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpkm69_XswLOJtFDHMIo9OSplPPReGKBBnVsP0e-lqlY70CVHzYrAqRmC6eQV-OktAfuXtfQRCKUTvE9IkO3LiasZzCidPbj-mUjmE04jKMBEZ8ukKzGUc3dZUTSstfXLd4cif/s1600-h/Mercator.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5032990957153633682&quot; style=&quot;DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpkm69_XswLOJtFDHMIo9OSplPPReGKBBnVsP0e-lqlY70CVHzYrAqRmC6eQV-OktAfuXtfQRCKUTvE9IkO3LiasZzCidPbj-mUjmE04jKMBEZ8ukKzGUc3dZUTSstfXLd4cif/s320/Mercator.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mercator Projection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;So given the name of this blog, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/blog-launch.html&quot;&gt;got started&lt;/a&gt; looking in on &lt;em&gt;Al Jazeerah&#39;s&lt;/em&gt; (which has since come a long way), I feel it appropriate to mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/control-rooms.html&quot;&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; I come across, both fictive and for real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fictive category, I just saw &lt;em&gt;The War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(1953_film)&quot;&gt;1953 edition&lt;/a&gt;) last evening, and noted the huge &lt;a href=&quot;http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&amp;hl=en&amp;amp;q=%22mercator+projection%22&quot;&gt;Mercator&lt;/a&gt; they were trying to win their war with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I hadn&#39;t quite realized about the plot, was the good professors had the right idea, about using some biochemical counter, but succumbed to the generalized panic attack, ending up in church and without any laboratory solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the idea from the pulpit may have been that prayers were what saved them, I think H.

Xbase was never a stupid language (though it may be used stupidly), with its procedural pointers to tabular data, combined with fast relational indexing, exposed in control structures. Best of all, it has an interactive command line (the infamous &quot;dot prompt&quot; in dBase), like Python does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came the OO revolution, with Microsoft buying Fox as a dBase killer, once Borland&#39;s plans, to stick with the brand &quot;dBase&quot; (Ashton-Tate&#39;s) became clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did the language die an ugly death at Microsoft&#39;s hands? No, I don&#39;t think so. The product remains an elegant solution in many situations and I&#39;m glad Redmond keeps putting muscle behind it, despite end users going gaga for Microsoft Access (a part of Office no less). VFP wasn&#39;t just about using objects from other languages (more the VB model), had its own class defining syntax, more like in &quot;VB#&quot; (i.e. VB .NET).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s great about xBase is you have this procedural way of stepping through tables &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you have embedded SQL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, I can see why we&#39;d use Oracle, Postgres or MySQL as a back end, but when it comes to creating a usable user interface, I still think the &quot;thick client&quot; has a future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Making everything work in a browser &quot;just because we can&quot; isn&#39;t a deep enough philosophy to persuade me otherwise -- not yet anyway, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/oscon-2005-tutorial-day-one.html&quot;&gt;XUL&lt;/a&gt; notwithstanding.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/9162822066186075098'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/9162822066186075098'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/corporate-screencasting.html' title='Corporate Screencasting'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4561718453512201363</id><published>2007-02-08T14:50:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-02-09T14:23:31.424-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The &quot;Surge&quot;</title><content type='html'>I haven&#39;t seen many journalists linking this verb &quot;surge&quot; to its ironic appearance in the CIA&#39;s literature, namely in Lindsay Moran&#39;s little book &lt;em&gt;Blowing My Cover&lt;/em&gt; (ISBN 0-399-15239-3). I include this quote in &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/alt.politics.org.cia/msg/4f6417a62000e1a5?hl=en&amp;&quot;&gt;my book review&lt;/a&gt; (January, 2005):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, in early 2003, not long after my return from Macedonia, I was &quot;surged&quot; to the Near East (NE) Division in order to help gear up for the invasion of Iraq. During my short tenure in Iraqi Operations, I met one woman who had covered Iraq&#39;s weapons of mass destruction program for more than a decade. She admitted to me, unequivocally, that the CIA had no definitive evidence whatsoever that Saddam Hussein&#39;s regime possessed WMD, or that Iraq presented anything close to an imminent threat to the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another CIA analyst, whose opinion I&#39;d solicited about the connection between Al Qa&#39;ida and Iraq, looked at me almost shamefacedly, shrugged, and said &quot;They both have the letter q?&quot; And a colleague who worked in the office covering Iraqi counterproliferation reported to me that her mealy-mouthed pen pusher of a boss had gathered together his minions and announced, &quot;Let&#39;s face it. The president wants us to go to war, and our job is to give him a reason to do it.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Like former CIAer &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Baer&quot;&gt;Robert Baer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365737/&quot;&gt;Syriania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; fame (haven&#39;t seen it yet), Lindsay registers little beyond disrespect for the neocon ideology that resulted in America&#39;s biggest blunder. Baer: &quot;I think the neocons have done more damage to the United States’ reputation and foreign policy than anybody since—I don’t know when. They’ve opened Pandora’s box in Iraq.&quot;  (&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/interview/2006/07/baer.html&quot;&gt;MotherJones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, July 5, 2006).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sad part was how these wackos, many of them &quot;government insiders&quot; (i.e. nut jobs in many cases), managed to infect the mass media pundits, by riding the post-911 wave of panic and hysteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journalists are easy prey for &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/10/legal-affairs.html&quot;&gt;cynical spin doctors&lt;/a&gt; in times of national distress. Let&#39;s remember that lesson and not repeat these same mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applaud the CIA&#39;s decision to move some of its most important (mostly training) facilities far beyond the beltway, in part just to get away from all the corruption and crummy intelligence that goes with living around Washington, DC. Presidents have long sought similar getaway havens, even if only 60 miles away at Camp David. DC just gets too oppressive at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;Followup (related news stories):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=ap.ikYuMdCUw&quot;&gt;Pre-War Intelligence Acts &#39;Inappropriate,&#39; U.S. Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 9 (Bloomberg).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/09/iraq/main2452482.shtml&quot;&gt;Pentagon Watchdog Slams Prewar Intel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Feb. 9 (CBS News).&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4561718453512201363'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4561718453512201363'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/surge.html' title='The &quot;Surge&quot;'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3974387503187732138</id><published>2007-02-06T16:39:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-02-06T23:52:36.654-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Synergeo #32395</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In my first storyboard, I paid some attention to social service and academic achievement i.e. a design scientist is someone willing to mix it up in the real world, not just push for Ivory Tower credentials, as the latter without the former may be quite meaningless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the main thrust of my storyboard was to find a bridge, starting in the known and moving towards the unknown (assuming a demographic still somewhat unfamiliar with even the basics of Fuller&#39;s metaphysics).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I start with the Qyoob (Cube) and use it to establish the 3D-hood of ordinary space. A 3-vector zig-zag on the corresponding simplex also combines these notions of &quot;3&quot; and &quot;spanning basis vectors&quot; but of course when the zig-zag is bent that way, you&#39;re thinking &quot;spatial&quot; the whole time, which is more the Synergetics mindset (we don&#39;t believe in &lt;em&gt;Flatland&lt;/em&gt; per se -- a rickety old Victorian belief system, ala Abbott&#39;s scifi by that name).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over on wittgenstein-dialognet, I&#39;m chatting with philosophers about this namespace thing some more. coxeter.d and fuller.d aren&#39;t synonymous. That doesn&#39;t mean we put these two scorpions in a bottle and make &#39;em fight it out. On the contrary, both steam engines and diesel engines create torque from liquid fuels. The goal is to investigate the mechanisms, to reach an understanding of inner workings, not to prove one or the other &quot;can&#39;t work&quot; (as if there weren&#39;t ample evidence that they both do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in moving from coxeter.3d (Euclidean 3dness) to fuller.4d, I&#39;m not trying to &quot;make Coxeter wrong&quot; in any important dimension. Rather, I&#39;m juxtaposing two &quot;ways of looking&quot; with a nomenclature (a namespace) to suit in each case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think one of the gross errors in some of the secondary literature to date is this idea that &quot;if &lt;em&gt;Synergetics&lt;/em&gt; is right, then XYZ goes out the window&quot;. On the contrary, &lt;em&gt;Synergetics&lt;/em&gt; is not about pushing any math to the back of the bus. Synergetics isn&#39;t going to stay at the back of the bus either though -- that&#39;s what academia is still trying to wrap its mind around (slowly, very slowly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I want to get more technical with the Coupler on a second pass, making this the bridge from XYZ thinking to IVM thinking. It&#39;s very easy to place 8 MITEs around (0,0,0), one per octant, and to see this as an entry point into IVM style cogitation, wherein two of the Coupler&#39;s equators become the &quot;fish lip&quot; rhombics connecting IVM (= CCP) balls, with the K-points as &quot;tongues touching&quot; perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve segued from stickworks.py to coupler.py for the benefit of my Pythonic math teacher squadron. They&#39;ll be the first on the block to have a VPython view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/stickworks.html&quot;&gt;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/stickworks.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3974387503187732138'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3974387503187732138'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/synergeo-32395.html' title='Synergeo #32395'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-9065594158929633307</id><published>2007-02-02T19:47:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-11-15T02:36:51.524-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Synergetics Storyboard</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;embed style=&quot;width:400px; height:326px;&quot; id=&quot;VideoPlayback&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; src=&quot;http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=2559031238575662161&amp;hl=en&quot; flashvars=&quot;&quot;&gt; &lt;/embed&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;:: a short ego trip ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I propose an order for topics, throwing in side lights along the way.
