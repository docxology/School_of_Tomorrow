We checked out &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Movie Madness&lt;/span&gt;, but both of us were into to saving our pennies.  I eyed the gum machine ($0.25), thought the better of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://bikefarm.org/blog/&quot;&gt;Bike Farm&lt;/a&gt; is gradually materializing the self-contained bicycle with trailer rig, for transporting the Yamaha in a colorful branded waterproof bag.  This would take her to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Good Bye Party&lt;/span&gt; gigs, rehearsals in progress.  The bike itself actually comes from a garden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared about Kerala, followed up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ananthapuri.com/board/topic.asp?topic_id=691&quot;&gt;some links&lt;/a&gt;.  Here&#39;s a niche market where civilians do pretty well for themselves (could do better of course) by applying their native smarts.  We also talked about peak oil, some of the distopian prophesies floating around.  I think Americans specialize in apocalyptic visions, a lot &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/wmbs-satire.html&quot;&gt;like the English&lt;/a&gt; in that way (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/05/some-autobio.html&quot;&gt;Christian influence&lt;/a&gt;?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whenever &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/shovel-ready.html&quot;&gt;Portlanders&lt;/a&gt; sound too cocky, it pays to think of such &quot;more with less&quot; places.  Neither of us was feeling that cocky though.  This economy is a bummer.  We&#39;re likely eligible for food stamps, though I haven&#39;t signed up for &#39;em (should &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/10/zone-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;cancel Netflix&lt;/a&gt; first).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good news front, Oregon&#39;s Newport is slated to become a federal research center into matters maritime, fits with cleaning out those old nets (underwater and deadly).  We&#39;re also on track to become one of Nissan&#39;s electric car testing zones (front page story today).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsey&#39;s strong baritone and edgy production values have people asking for more.  She&#39;s being generous with her &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/experience-music.html&quot;&gt;public appearances&lt;/a&gt;, as one must be at the outset of a new career (she&#39;d been into servicing company aircraft, from a back office IT angle in Savannah), but I expect will see more studio time down the road.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimmylott.com/&quot;&gt;Jimmy Lott&lt;/a&gt; might have some pointers (another neighbor and friend).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m hoping to produce some kind of event at the Multnomah Meetinghouse on October 2nd, around issues that &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/passing-torch.html&quot;&gt;matter to young people&lt;/a&gt;.  To me, that means &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/quakers-101.html&quot;&gt;amplified music&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;m hoping Lindsey&#39;s emerging connections in several venues, including in &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/07/building-library.html&quot;&gt;Portland&#39;s FOSS culture&lt;/a&gt;, will help me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/drug-wars.html&quot;&gt;a boomer-geezer&lt;/a&gt; (and by extension &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/cinco-de-mayo.html&quot;&gt;ISEPP&lt;/a&gt;) stay connected with the thirty-somethings and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3796413442/&quot; title=&quot;Movie Madness Guy by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2441/3796413442_96ca824b43_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Movie Madness Guy&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;:: @ movie madness ::&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5711659671853727546'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/5711659671853727546'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/walking-with-walker.html' title='Walking with Walker'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2441/3796413442_96ca824b43_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3580419631430143507</id><published>2009-08-04T17:52:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-10-05T23:04:48.425-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Drug Wars</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m finding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leap.cc/cms/index.php&quot;&gt;Law Enforcement Against Prohibition&lt;/a&gt; to be doing far more effective PR than NPYM Quakers in their &lt;a href=&quot;http://westernfriend.org/2008/08/npyms-minute-on-the-war-on-drugs/&quot;&gt;2008 minute&lt;/a&gt; on this topic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The NPYM Quakers urge decriminalizing marijuana use but still want to prosecute growers and sellers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
We also call for decriminalization of drug use and possession, though not production or sale, in order to end the injustice...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
How is that consistent (or just) I wonder?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
MJ should already be legally available by now, through any OLCC certified outlet.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/cereal-box-rant.html&quot;&gt;End Prohibition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Treat minors differently sure (we already do), by teaching good health habits in school (anyone doing that, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/07/make-them-fat.html&quot;&gt;our &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In general I&#39;m concerned that Quakers have &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/09/dissing-quakes.html&quot;&gt;dumbed themselves down&lt;/a&gt; to become just another sect of bland Protestant (blech).  Lets hope they snap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re suffering from a &quot;high geezer quotient&quot; in PNW Quaker circles.&lt;br /&gt;

The boomers have grown into 1950s style Good Doobies (aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/mining-cartoons.html&quot;&gt;Squares&lt;/a&gt;), a tiresome breed inheriting from those &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/cry-baby-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;teacuppy Victorians&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3580419631430143507'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3580419631430143507'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/drug-wars.html' title='Drug Wars'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-7509639053176631835</id><published>2009-08-01T21:31:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2020-09-19T12:28:55.478-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Iranian Festival</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Twas my privilege this afternoon to throng with Greater Portland&#39;s Iranian community, got some baklava and iced tea at the Intel booth, listened to music, wandered around taking pictures. I didn&#39;t know anyone there, plus was involved in trip planning by cell, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/03/high-desert.html&quot;&gt;talking high desert&lt;/a&gt;. That didn&#39;t keep me from taking it all in though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, Iranian politics is complicated and I know better than to just jam my finger into working machinery going &quot;what&#39;s this?&quot; or, even worse, &quot;do that!&quot;. Probably Portland mirrors a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/11/standup-comedy-at-newmark-theater.html&quot;&gt;the attitudes&lt;/a&gt;, so I could assemble a more accurate picture over time, but that would require knowing more of these people and I didn&#39;t see a single person I recognized the entire time, which surprised me a little.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of who gets to talk about what, I got into this game of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-upmanship&quot;&gt;one-upmanship&lt;/a&gt; with this guy on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergeo&lt;/span&gt; with relatives in the service. We were putting our cards on the table as to which of us had more street cred:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He: I wore a US uniform fighting forest fires, been in firefights. Nuff said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me: I used to dress up as KGB in the USSR, but no one knew that&#39;s what I was doing, as I disguised myself as &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/simpsons-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;an American tourist&lt;/a&gt; traveling with family. Fun pulling the wool over their eyes in this way.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
OK, so that&#39;s just crazy talk (not that I was lying exactly, having been &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/intourist-pdx.html&quot;&gt;through Moscow that time&lt;/a&gt;), but such is the uncontrolled banter on that list, lots of yakking about wild animals and sea life as well. Wanderers and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/plates/plates.html&quot;&gt;students of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have a lot in common I sometimes suppose.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/7509639053176631835'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/7509639053176631835'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/iranian-festival.html' title='Iranian Festival'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4436910747742883206</id><published>2009-07-30T21:53:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-08-02T16:34:09.310-07:00</updated><title type='text'>From Wittrs</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://seanwilson.org/wittgenstein.discussion.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 111px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTu0MDGuC1_Fev0KFndBgnOdSKuNAAN4ex5SsvOBS9sXcnspu2uARf2bwtMjIukhNrE-mAH9CZc2E5zd5UO3M0SJcquSiJhH7eYfq_pYjm6VlWVsoWXLRphOg1RdGG-JbEtd3K/s320/wittrs.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5364484407468737874&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;People bring a lot of mental baggage to philosophy, a kind of suitcase word (alluding to Marvin Minsky), are hoping it&#39;ll give &#39;em some grand unified theory of something or other.  I think Wittgenstein&#39;s camp is mostly designed as a sanctuary for refugees from those views, wanting to find out what, if anything, remains of value, once you &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;subtract&lt;/span&gt; all the claptrap of &quot;big ideas&quot; i.e. it&#39;s a paring back to a skeleton, a deliberate &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;starving&lt;/span&gt; vis-a-vis an old diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like if you&#39;ve swilled beer all your life (as I have, since high school), like schmaltzy philosophy (like the Wagnerian stuff), &quot;big ideas&quot; (deep narrator voice at the movies, making stentorian comments about &quot;man&quot;, about &quot;logic&quot;), then this &quot;no beer&quot; philosophy is definitely not for you. It&#39;s spare, austere, stark, zen.  Nothing&#39;s happening.  There&#39;s no &quot;holding one&#39;s breath&quot; for the next issue of &#39;Nature&#39; or &#39;Science&#39; (except in the sense you&#39;re usually expecting lots of nasty twisted thinking folded into the mix).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final image:  philosophy the way Wittgenstein came to show it, is like the janitors coming at the end of the parade, sweeping up all the horse and elephant poop (wow, elephants!).  99% of folks who feel drawn to philosophy are there for the floats, the bling, the marching bands.  By the time the janitors show up, they&#39;re drifting away. Wittgenstein waves, at the helm of a street sweeper. Sean and I swoon, but most have folded their chairs and drifted off, gabbing about the floats (&quot;did you see those &lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;strippers&lt;/span&gt;!?&quot; (HB2U Lindsey Walker)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3774285072/&quot; title=&quot;Twilight Zone by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3470/3774285072_58d14681f3_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Twilight Zone&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4436910747742883206'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4436910747742883206'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/from-wittrs.html' title='From Wittrs'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiTu0MDGuC1_Fev0KFndBgnOdSKuNAAN4ex5SsvOBS9sXcnspu2uARf2bwtMjIukhNrE-mAH9CZc2E5zd5UO3M0SJcquSiJhH7eYfq_pYjm6VlWVsoWXLRphOg1RdGG-JbEtd3K/s72-c/wittrs.png" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-2766959080651800714</id><published>2009-07-28T08:26:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-26T01:33:53.064-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Passing the Torch</title><content type='html'>Having joined the over-50 set, I&#39;m supposed to role model &quot;showing the ropes&quot; to a younger set, then gracefully bow out, although I&#39;m allowed to keep doing that (always new ropes to show ya).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the context of Quakers, this means recruiting people to committees more of the age Dawn and I first were when we started with Friends in the 1990s, when we were married under our meeting&#39;s care (on 9-11, 1993).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Quarterly Meetings have become a signature blend of oldsters by and large, even though our theme last year was &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Future of Friends&lt;/span&gt;.  Elizabeth Fischer, clerk of Multnomah&#39;s program committee, was eloquent in pointing this out at our planning meeting last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wqm-day-one.html&quot;&gt;I suggested music&lt;/a&gt; as one possible theme for our October gathering, thinking of social action through lyrics, or at least social bonding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fifteen minutes after that meeting, I was listening to a young woman rap her heart out about the cruelties of high school, where the power of a woman to &quot;just say no&quot; (to all kinds of stuff, not just sex) is often challenged (as in ignored).  Her imagery became violent which, as &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/avp-again.html&quot;&gt;an AVP technique&lt;/a&gt;, I have no problem with (fantasy violence in lyrics is sometimes a way of venting and staying cool headed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group was supportive and welcoming.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/charlie-wilsons-war-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Belly dancing&lt;/a&gt; broke out (for real, not just an imitation) in what was clearly a safer than average environment for free self expression without fear of intimidation and reprisals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Tag was there on a different schedule, in the midst of her gender studies research, a true professional, as was &lt;a href=&quot;http://lindseywalkerblogs.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Lindsey Walker&lt;/a&gt;, my Pauling House associate and fellow denizen in Richmond (she and Dr. Tag know each other thanks to our meeting of the minds, with Scott, at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Belmont Inn&lt;/span&gt; last week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d invited some other Friends in hopes of starting to bridge the generational divide.

with my new friend and professor of gender studies &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3751824838/&quot;&gt;Dr. Tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m such a dweeb about music and if I&#39;m to walk my talk early in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-music-millenium-notes.html&quot;&gt;Music Millennium&lt;/a&gt; (a transition figure, kinda like Petrarch), I should at least sound more technically attuned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/krishnabluedatsun&quot;&gt;Scott&lt;/a&gt; explained later how his lineup with lotsa &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/movie-sunday.html&quot;&gt;Neil Young&lt;/a&gt; had as much to do with the caypo as anything i.e. not usually using one, and not wanting to slide it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/lindseywalkermusic&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsey&lt;/a&gt; was typically free and open about her process, telling us right during her set which ones she was still working on (open mic is a chance to experiment sometimes, do improv).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/heatherahunter&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heather&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; petite, strangely shaped guitar was a source of fascination for us.  Dr. Tag isn&#39;t shy about conducting interviews, which the talent clearly appreciates.  I hung back and shot stills with my Olympus Stylus, mostly on the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3751826310/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;available light&lt;/a&gt;&quot; setting, rarely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3751036083/&quot;&gt;with flash&lt;/a&gt;.  Throw some more dollars into this picture, and you could see us as a two person TV crew (one in front of the camera, one behind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The climax of the evening was this group called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/codeoctopus&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;theUnreal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a small traveling troupe that shouts &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/charter-schools.html&quot;&gt;hip hop style poetry&lt;/a&gt;, can finish one another&#39;s lines, moves in and out of chorus mode.  Each has a &quot;pause, rewind&quot; verbal command set it can use to remote control the others, with each performer well trained to follow such commands without hesitation or fluster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cool language game!  I bet &lt;a href=&quot;http://seanwilson.org/wittgenstein.discussion.html&quot;&gt;Wittgenstein&lt;/a&gt; woulda sat up in his chair for this one, maybe joined in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although serious musicians have strong self discipline, they suffer from the same self doubts as ordinary mortals, plus are surrounded by talent, so if you have none you tend to stick out like a sore thumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these could hold their own, which is saying quite a bit in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Muddy Waters&lt;/span&gt;, which has been doing open mic for a long time (I&#39;m just learning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four of us adjourned to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Belmont Inn&lt;/span&gt; afterward, a sports bar of sorts, cram packed on a Thursday night, but we did find a good table.  We enjoyed a free ranging discussion of geopolitics, the two Georgias, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan&quot;&gt;Azerbaijan&lt;/a&gt;, travel plans, the recent concert in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hyde Park&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been a good doobie re my &quot;no beer diet&quot; (a fast way to slim down in my case), stuck to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bushmills&lt;/span&gt; (an Irish whiskey) and some snax.  I wore one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3751826912/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;signature costumes&lt;/a&gt;, wanting to blend in to this scene without surrendering my identity as a Silicon Forest professional.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3557424828152303851'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3557424828152303851'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/experience-music.html' title='Experience Music'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2616/3731728608_72f6540018_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-3496800904870498326</id><published>2009-07-22T16:36:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-01-20T22:32:44.729-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Memorable Events</title><content type='html'>&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/HQbTMEupTpk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/HQbTMEupTpk&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;TEXT-ALIGN: center&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;with thanks to anna z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/tlJe-fliXKc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/tlJe-fliXKc&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3496800904870498326'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/3496800904870498326'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/memorable-events.html' title='Memorable Events'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-8541571368881459580</id><published>2009-07-20T02:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-23T06:43:23.974-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The Corporation (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxB96FLPjVj1KNR5LjX3PctVTpKVkC21_BAKWtAK6IT8BPR3_rhoZlXSXdG7o4z9rvfmAhXkcEZCOl9Cv1JmDDuO-pmPPvxorwlUirZX8zHKQgAtX8DbJB5nNbMNuk6SCJfAKI/s1600-h/the_corporation.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 154px; height: 200px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxB96FLPjVj1KNR5LjX3PctVTpKVkC21_BAKWtAK6IT8BPR3_rhoZlXSXdG7o4z9rvfmAhXkcEZCOl9Cv1JmDDuO-pmPPvxorwlUirZX8zHKQgAtX8DbJB5nNbMNuk6SCJfAKI/s200/the_corporation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360502290093755154&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;In theory, at least in my own mind, this was a dry run for the shared viewing model I&#39;m encouraging among Wanderers: borrow something &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/taking-inventory.html&quot;&gt;from inventory&lt;/a&gt; and watch it as a group, of two at least, and then file something electronically, so we have something more searchable and world-readable.  You might even watch the same vid in different groups, gaining different perspectives thereby.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In practice, we watched a commercial DVD, not one of the ISEPP tapes, a lengthy documentary I&#39;d seen at &lt;i&gt;Cinema 21&lt;/i&gt; years ago.  You could consider this a sequel or prequel to &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/this-land-is-your-land-movie-review_28.html&quot;&gt;This Land is Your Land&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My viewing partner felt the movie was effective in inspiring outrage, wanted to purge the ranks, cull the herd, but then these high caliber &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/10/designing-engineers.html&quot;&gt;designing engineer&lt;/a&gt; types easily transmute (sublimate) such urges into melody and/or sculpture, performance art, are too professional to indulge in gratuitous violence.  Our Silicon Forest is blessed with such beings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She had other cogent comments, having read some of the related literature (as had I).  She appreciated &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/dark-side-of-sun.html&quot;&gt;Chomsky&lt;/a&gt; for his grounding influence, for getting her off her higher, more purely bred horse (probably faster than his too, but then we&#39;re all getting older).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From my angle, this highly spun documentary was a self parody in some ways, as it includes some of these wildcard creepazoid &quot;spies&quot; who say all the right things, yet seem just a tad on the slick side, plus the film itself is superbly edited and branded, a really tight package i.e. it typifies &quot;corporate&quot; in the sense of &quot;high production values&quot; (very Madison Avenue).  Inevitably, there&#39;s some mirroring going on.  We all use consumer goods from time to time, are a part of the same food chain, may even engage in nagging (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/princeton-dinner.html&quot;&gt;badgering&lt;/a&gt;), other &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/decoding-usa-culture.html&quot;&gt;media manipulation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I could just imagine a moneymaker CEO on his knees, begging these filmmakers to please please sell his snake oil, if only money could buy such a stairway to heaven.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My partner made the core point that it&#39;s a matter of who has the best, most compelling story. Like most CEOs only have flimsey economics to fall back on as a rationale and peddle their product or service in predicatable ways, are cast in a merchant&#39;s mold. Pro scholars, on the other hand, have the benefit of painstaking research with lots of dot connecting (especially in hindsight).  As a result, their stories win our hearts and minds more than either empty denials or mea culpas, other salesman type ploys (gotta hand it to that rug seller though: he&#39;s good at his job).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, I think there just wasn&#39;t time, even in the two hours or whatever it was, to introduce all the main players, let alone all the extras.  Corporations fly by, lots of &#39;em, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/we-are-borg.html&quot;&gt;a defense contractor&lt;/a&gt; or two, but as we&#39;re focusing on that specific legal structure known as &quot;the corporation&quot; we&#39;re thereby &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; looking so much at brands of religion, some of which run hospitals or other NGOs, or organize big ticket festivals, attractive to tourists and/or pilgrims. Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/fast-food-nation.html&quot;&gt;Bhutan&#39;s military&lt;/a&gt; bottles and sells booze to the Bhutanese public to help sustain itself. No time for that design pattern here, nor for the technicalities of banking, micro-lending, Sharia&#39;s non-interest based approach.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;People enjoy being ethical and/or ethically subversive and we had many species of subversive in this film, including some maybe reaching out into the theater, recruiting for their home teams.  Maybe &lt;i&gt;Shell&lt;/i&gt; has netted a new loyal employee or two, or a least a few fans, as a result of this movie? The CEO and his wife seemed an endearing couple.  Arcata looked homey and democracy-minded (aren&#39;t cities and townships sometimes &quot;incorporated&quot; -- just means you have papers to wave around right? -- a charter of some kind, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/coyote-academy.html&quot;&gt;a school&lt;/a&gt; has).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;IBM certainly got its head handed to itself on a plate, another item for processing, a topic I delve into in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/urner-workshop.html&quot;&gt;my Chicago workshop&lt;/a&gt; as well.  Fox also gets it in the neck in Florida, after like 83 chances to show some backbone around that &quot;what&#39;s in the milk?&quot; question.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Because of our intrinsic propensity to live ethically, to have integrity, I think we&#39;re going along with what this film proposes we do, are in the process of redesigning many of our commercial business institutions, somewhat from the ground up, most probably in software (law books too slow, not self executing enough).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/12/car-czar.html&quot;&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; is maybe trailblazing in this direction, given its new lease on life as a public/private partnership, although I&#39;m not claiming any special insights at this point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m more hopeful than that the guy towards the end, predicting a lot more darkness, but then we&#39;ve seen a lot of water under the bridge since then.  We have more reasons for hope than he did, see some light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, there&#39;s no point saddling any of these people with the views they express, if they&#39;ve since come to more refined and/or evolved positions in the meantime. Sure we might say &quot;I told you so&quot; in some cases, but then hindsight gives us an unfair advantage perhaps.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A lot of us have been thinking a lot about this stuff, so let&#39;s not pretend like today is just a repeat of yesterday, just more business as usual, even if we still start it with &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/cereal-box-rant.html&quot;&gt;FMV Cornflakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, end it with a &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3735986883/&quot;&gt;Rogue Ale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; or one of those.  Although commerce is ancient, the rule space for doing business is not. What Bucky Fuller called &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/ghost-trains.html&quot;&gt;LAWCAP&lt;/a&gt; is already a dead language (not evolving).  We&#39;re in the process of morphing into &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/commercial-break.html&quot;&gt;something new&lt;/a&gt;, and not a moment too soon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKIFUjO4qFNRQ6IUndFaaJsfjYMVsADoI3zBqSTamXNrVr_fItSMX255G_k34Z2E3GhyphenhyphenSL4X4ISVhj4nJ2hHzNPjFYtX69N2TL3aO_CR7-_ouja2tctymzzqEF4b9XYKhwgGYO/s1600-h/corporation2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 154px; height: 200px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjKIFUjO4qFNRQ6IUndFaaJsfjYMVsADoI3zBqSTamXNrVr_fItSMX255G_k34Z2E3GhyphenhyphenSL4X4ISVhj4nJ2hHzNPjFYtX69N2TL3aO_CR7-_ouja2tctymzzqEF4b9XYKhwgGYO/s200/corporation2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5360501926301472994&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8541571368881459580'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/8541571368881459580'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/corporation-movie-review.html' title='The Corporation (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjxB96FLPjVj1KNR5LjX3PctVTpKVkC21_BAKWtAK6IT8BPR3_rhoZlXSXdG7o4z9rvfmAhXkcEZCOl9Cv1JmDDuO-pmPPvxorwlUirZX8zHKQgAtX8DbJB5nNbMNuk6SCJfAKI/s72-c/the_corporation.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4712553160234457117</id><published>2009-07-17T11:06:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-18T09:57:01.884-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Merit Pay</title><content type='html'>As one might anticipate, what comes up in some of these &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/planning-meetings.html&quot;&gt;planning meetings&lt;/a&gt; is the double whammy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/pair-teaching.html&quot;&gt;pair teaching&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1966464&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;merit pay&lt;/a&gt; both.  How are we to double the number of math teachers along the digital math track (where pairing&#39;s the norm, staggered terms) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; merit pay them so they don&#39;t run off seeking better compensation in the private sector?  In a constricting economy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of it&#39;s bookkeeping.  You go to this like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;already&lt;/span&gt; highly enough paid Intel engineer and ask &quot;why don&#39;t you get to pass the torch to high school aged students as a part of your job description?&quot; and the engineer goes &quot;I&#39;d love to, but doesn&#39;t the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;education mafia&lt;/span&gt; have a lock on that gig?&quot; (he sounds &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/battle-lost.html&quot;&gt;remarkably like Haim&lt;/a&gt;, no?).  &quot;What if we bring the students to you, let you use your own equipment?&quot; (talking to Hewlett-Packard this time).  HP: &quot;You sure make it sound easy&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So pretty soon, we have pairs of teachers with higher pay, doing green field development along an essentially open terrain.  We&#39;ve left the analog math teachers to their tired pre-wired ways, with no energy wasted on telling them how to change (a fruitless business), not our concern.  We&#39;ve got our own track to worry about, our turtles, robots, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/for-ada.html&quot;&gt;Bernoulli Numbers&lt;/a&gt;, you name it.  Students vote with their feet (or butts if &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/planning-charter.html&quot;&gt;riding Max&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, but how does this work in more rural areas further from Aloha, Beaverton, Hillsboro?  Won&#39;t we need to build spanking new facilities and bus the teachers as well as the kids?  Yeah, we might have to do that in some cases, but since when were opportunities to prototype and showcase novelties a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;bad&lt;/span&gt; thing?  Don&#39;t you &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;want&lt;/span&gt; to see a &quot;classroom of tomorrow&quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/escaping-light-pollution.html&quot;&gt;high desert Oregon&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about regular math teachers on the analog track who&#39;d like nothing more than to defect to our schools.  Remember, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6770390&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;all public schools have a charter&lt;/a&gt; ergo are charter schools, so the system is more seamless than you might suppose.  Teachers wanting to step forward might run through as students in some scenarios, just to sample the goods, keep the learning experience more inter-generational, plus they&#39;ll get specific trainings geared for already on-the-job math teachers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will they accuse us of union busting, because we&#39;re bringing in all these geeks outside of &quot;mafia&quot; control?  I doubt it.  The public wants a better experience for its young and this is all about providing same.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/lobbying-again.html&quot;&gt;Legislators understand&lt;/a&gt; why a DM track is needed (or a lot of &#39;em do).  It&#39;s win-win all around provided we don&#39;t forget what the goal is:  to make the Global U a U worth attending.  This brings me to the subject of Food Services (their inadequacy, thanks to a weak economics curriculum), but that&#39;s for other postings.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4712553160234457117'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4712553160234457117'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/merit-pay.html' title='Merit Pay'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4691256540236198026</id><published>2009-07-16T15:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-16T15:45:31.190-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Compare and Contrast</title><content type='html'>Here&#39;s some homework, essays due tomorrow, Twitter me.

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: therapy ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lotsa school teachers get outraged by the deplorable content of some Youtubes, and I agree these videos about bullying seem amusing only to prosecutors, happy to get state&#39;s evidence handed to &#39;em on a plate like that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, finding outlets for aggression is an age-old challenge and not everyone wants to morph into a world class NFL player, what with all those later-life weight problems, even with high salaries, constant public adoration.  Guitar and hotel room trashing rock stars tend to flame out too quickly, with similar problems in aging.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I actually encourage violence against inanimate objects as potentially therapeutic, enjoy hitting my &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-developments.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Phil pillow&lt;/a&gt;&quot; sometimes, even if only mentally. So go ahead and brand me a heretic, for encouraging such as the above.  Like just today I wrote, in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Math Forum&lt;/span&gt; no less:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6783034&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;That example&lt;/a&gt; was simply to blow calculators and their wee little screens out of the water.  We call them &quot;hamster brained&quot;, use other epithets, maybe show Youtubes of running them over in a car, get that aggression creatively channeled.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6784166&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;What &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;was&lt;/span&gt; I thinking&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, my &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/12/avp-2-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;AVP polemics&lt;/a&gt; are controversial, including in Quaker circles, explains my moves to start up a remote brand, protect Friends from the consequences of my experiments &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/rocket-science.html&quot;&gt;in rocket science&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mostly I&#39;m considered a fairly safe operator though, and I&#39;m guessing most of these calculators were already broken, and if not may I recommend first turning them on and destroying them while lit?  Could we get some sparks please?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, it&#39;s not the same thing as book burning.  A skillful judge would see the difference, even a white one, snicker (sorry, obscure historical allusion).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2951632561252095406'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2951632561252095406'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/contraband.html' title='Contraband'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-8476774655258953991</id><published>2009-07-11T17:11:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-11-04T10:05:02.101-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Busy Weekend</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglJEJlaez_DZoQuH2M_1avdZtV4Cno7WTnGW5b1seNOsGMiLYu4LuTwQBZLIGcNqurWnvUOdoaI7LxwhErdbT3ZZICh93Rz2agutj9-57z5DAt-ZHiQIDYiN63c0Ky6xvcKg6u/s1600-h/P7110073.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglJEJlaez_DZoQuH2M_1avdZtV4Cno7WTnGW5b1seNOsGMiLYu4LuTwQBZLIGcNqurWnvUOdoaI7LxwhErdbT3ZZICh93Rz2agutj9-57z5DAt-ZHiQIDYiN63c0Ky6xvcKg6u/s320/P7110073.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357381585269028082&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I&#39;m double booked on Sunday, when &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://urbanedibles.org/&quot;&gt;UrbanEdibles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is looking at switching to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/portland/2009-July/000788.html&quot;&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt;, reminds me of the Foodhub proposal (the one I submitted).  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3714228417/&quot;&gt;Dr. Martin&lt;/a&gt; (emeritus) is hosting an afternoon HB2U type event and mom never gets to see him almost, Bob being &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/renewing-old-ties.html&quot;&gt;Roberta&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; partner, so I said we&#39;d turn up there, after a clearness for membership meeting in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/rocket-science.html&quot;&gt;Beanite tradition&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npym.org/&quot;&gt;NPYM&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I serve on Oversight and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/10/wqm-fall-2005.html&quot;&gt;WQM planning&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;Multnomah&lt;/i&gt;, as local AFSC liaison for &lt;i&gt;Bridge City&lt;/i&gt;.

Just bossing people around, telling them to do impossible things, giving pep talks, is hardly managing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are your bosses like that guy who breaks glass and talks dirty &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/charlie-wilsons-war-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Charlie Wilson&#39;s War&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Remember, that was an actor, a good one, with screenwriters behind him. People who act like that for real get carted away by security and put in a hamster cage, with Xanax snax through a slot, signed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/wanderers-2009623.html&quot;&gt;a doctor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frequently, someone highly intelligent, a service sector engineer, will become a cog in this machine, and get over stressed, because the overall design is unworkable and that becomes transparent after awhile. It&#39;s a living wage and a dead end at the same time, and that&#39;s crazy-making. &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/rebuilding-iraq.html&quot;&gt;She&lt;/a&gt; might go to her boss and say &quot;I want out&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Multiply this a number of times and you get what we call a &quot;brain drain&quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_%28Fuller%29&quot;&gt;cybernetics&lt;/a&gt;, a feedback loop, and pretty soon some silos are Pointy Haired Bosses all the way down, not a Dilbert among them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In entrepreneurial cultures, such as Republicans foster (in talk if not walk [1]), an escape valve for the talented and gifted, not always the rich and famous, is to form a &quot;spin off startup&quot; that works to right noted wrongs aboard &quot;mother ship&quot;. Iterations happen faster and the companies get &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/school-business.html&quot;&gt;leaner and meaner&lt;/a&gt;, or develop whatever &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/lailas-birthday-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;exaptations&lt;/a&gt; serve in the larger bioregion. At least that&#39;s the press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Portland is fortunate in having an entrepreneurial culture and a steady influx of talented refugees burning out in Lower48. They&#39;ll never work for a Pointy Haired Boss again, at the risk of going postal, but if you have Dilberts at the top (both XX and XY), then you might get a second look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they&#39;re not teaching &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/screen-tests.html&quot;&gt;the Bucky stuff&lt;/a&gt; in high school out there, is just another metaphor for the brokenness of this &quot;next quarter&quot; way of thinking, so-called &quot;business as usual&quot; (more it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/why-civilizations-fail.html&quot;&gt;a freakish anomaly&lt;/a&gt;, as longer lived cultures make longer term investments, including America&#39;s indigenous ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is less an indictment of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html&quot;&gt;USA&lt;/a&gt; than of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/carrier-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;LAWCAP&lt;/a&gt;, a post-WW2 internal gear works and puppeteer for its version of the USA. When that gear works seized up, became semi-paralyzed, it became more obvious to all that the men and women behind the curtain weren&#39;t really governing so much as helping themselves to the returns on past investments, made by relative giants, e.g. J.P. Morgan, FDR, Vannevar Bush, Walt Disney, other larger-than-life figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1] a famed quip of GWB&#39;s was that &quot;the problem with French culture is they have no word for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;entrepreneur&lt;/span&gt;&quot;.

Jacobs used in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/12/its-show-time.html&quot;&gt;his play about Bucky&lt;/a&gt;, reminiscent of Turing Machines as well, also electroencephalographs, electrocardiograms, all that good stuff -- lots of wiggly needles (polygraphs, whatever).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except we&#39;re not so into those analog metaphors (continuous graphs), prefer lots of data points, more like alphanumeric stuff. Of course it&#39;s not either/or. You might even have cines (what heart doctors call the little movies they make, of your heart beating and stuff, perhaps with a dye for contrast). It&#39;s a lot like a blog actually, a time-stamped scroll that starts before you&#39;re born with some ultrasound, continues awhile after you die, giving cause of death information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Joe Public wants to know is what prying eyes are going over his records, looking for information to use against him, like to hike his premiums or other blackmail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are legitimate suspicions, not to be pooh poohed, and fortunately at the vanguard of medical science are our military services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not fortunate in the sense that we wish for bloodshed (better to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/crosscultural-workouts.html&quot;&gt;not fight&lt;/a&gt; like that), but in the sense that institutions professionally concerned with defense will thereby be somewhat savvy about encryption, and Joe Public&#39;s privacy is best assured if we make wise use of cryptographic tools to ensure that high standards of medical ethics are upheld.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instruments &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/tuesday-at-work.html&quot;&gt;might sign their outputs&lt;/a&gt; for authentication e.g. the hospital maintains a trusted ring of devices certified to spit back measures. Sometimes we&#39;ll want to trace back to that device by serial number, in case of a suspected calibration error, or more likely we&#39;re simply keeping cross-checks &quot;because we can&quot; i.e. for future research purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like if I&#39;m doctor X in Cincinnati, seeing this patient recently arrived from Singapore, and they zap me a pass key to the &quot;main lobby&quot; of this patient&#39;s history, I might then request further types of authentication just to verify that this is indeed what it purports to be, i.e. the instrumentation checks come back affirmative, like a microscope saying &quot;yeah, I looked at that once, and I really do exist in room 14A&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not suggesting we&#39;re anywhere close to the above, just that doctors, like patients, needn&#39;t assume an all-or-nothing vista, when it comes to accessing medical records, either another&#39;s or one&#39;s own. On the other hand, summary certifications that you aren&#39;t infectious in various ways might save you the trouble of getting tested, for job situations where contaminants might be dangerous (space station?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, you&#39;d have easy ways to assure those with a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/pseudonymizer.html&quot;&gt;need to know&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that you&#39;re over eighteen, have adequate night vision etc. etc. -- just like a note from your doctor, signed and everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m thinking if we&#39;re successful in starting up some more &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/usa-os.html&quot;&gt;ecovillages with quasi-autonomy&lt;/a&gt;, more like company towns (though often with more democratic structures) that we&#39;ll see these problems addressed in many a microcosm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3638445679/in/set-72157619963850814/&quot;&gt;open standards bodies&lt;/a&gt; will grow up in between, with vendors touting their compatibility with those standards, same as it ever was.

Mass killing by remote control just isn&#39;t what spooks are about (they&#39;re more &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;what you &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt; when you do that stuff i.e. that haunting feeling that you&#39;ll be passed over for promotion, at least in this lifetime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May the uber-cowards rot in hell for all eternity (God might &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/forgiveness.html&quot;&gt;forgive&lt;/a&gt; them but I never will -- but then I&#39;m a &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/this-land-is-your-land-movie-review_28.html&quot;&gt;throwaway mortal&lt;/a&gt; so who cares).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another topic, we enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/family-gathering.html&quot;&gt;a fine family reunion&lt;/a&gt; today, thanks to Bill Lightfoot.  I&#39;m glad the Talmadges are taking bold action in Bellingham.  I hope to get there one day soon, enroute to the meeting in BC.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6633056698575393423'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/6633056698575393423'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/killing-field.html' title='Killing Field'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4703746730843033469</id><published>2009-06-22T20:15:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-24T16:34:40.544-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Recessionology</title><content type='html'>As I was mentioning to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/show-time.html&quot;&gt;OS Bridge group&lt;/a&gt;, if you&#39;re politically &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;against&lt;/span&gt; something, talk about how expensive it is, whereas if you&#39;re &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; it, talk up the jobs it&#39;ll create.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, a serious commitment to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/pair-teaching.html&quot;&gt;pair teaching&lt;/a&gt;, even if only along a trailblazing digital math track in test zip code areas, would create lots of new opportunities, including for vets in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, we&#39;d probably import &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;some&lt;/span&gt; of our talent &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/shipping-jobs-overseas.html&quot;&gt;from overseas&lt;/a&gt;, maybe from schools &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-kind-of-charter.html&quot;&gt;already doing it&lt;/a&gt; (FOSS culture is everywhere), given the local schools aren&#39;t that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html&quot;&gt;well focused&lt;/a&gt; (yet). However, the gap could narrow with time and with a certain amount of revamping i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/pps-has-friends-in-silicon-forest.html&quot;&gt;curriculum overhaul&lt;/a&gt;, especially at the teacher training level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So is doubling the need for math teachers a good thing or a bad thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re thinking how damn expensive it&#39;ll be, you probably don&#39;t like, and maybe don&#39;t understand, your mathematics, a big part of your American heritage (president Garfield had a cool &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/visual-proofs.html&quot;&gt;visual proof&lt;/a&gt; for the Pythagorean Theorem involving trapezoids -- another geek president we should learn more about).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some idiocrats are thinking:  &quot;if there&#39;s no money for promising civilian initiatives, then maybe pent up frustration will build us a head of steam and we can get on with some war&quot;, which is of course the &quot;el cheapo&quot; way to think i.e. it&#39;s easy-sleazy to imagine war profiteering scenarios, once a sufficient level of mayhem and mob psychology is dialed in with mass media complicity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stoking the flames of war is what &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;fear-based politics&lt;/a&gt; is all about (aka the so-called &quot;War on Terror&quot;), as typified by the various millennial apocalyptic and/or neocon pathologies, usually tinged with religious lunacy ala that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opusdei.us/art.php?p=6437&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Opus Dei&lt;/span&gt; nutcase&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/welcome-to-reality.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Da Vinci Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Ollie North is another example, although maybe it&#39;s autism in his case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a whole generation had grown sick of war in the 1940s, at least in the European theater, a vastly &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/american-look-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;transformative futurism&lt;/a&gt; took hold of this nation&#39;s imagination, centered around the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/salem-and-eugene.html&quot;&gt;I-net&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/buckaneer-lore.html&quot;&gt;Interstate Freeway System&lt;/a&gt;, and the commuter-based lifestyles this system might support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People would watch movie trailers about how these things called &quot;on ramps&quot; and &quot;merging&quot; would soon be in their future.  World&#39;s Fairs were devoted to this topic, with those favoring urban rail considered killjoys by the grand visionaries.  What happened next is &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/cars-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;the world of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We could scrape together a promising futurism even today, given how far our technologies have advanced since the 1940s.  However, Americans have grown fat and docile, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/why-civilizations-fail.html&quot;&gt;like Eloi&lt;/a&gt;, and herd together like lemmings in &quot;fear clutches&quot;, many of them based on a tradition of protest (aka &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/07/more-on-usa-os.html&quot;&gt;protestant&lt;/a&gt;&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to &quot;protest&quot; mentalities, somebody must be vilified and blamed, fingers must be pointed, and revenge against the wicked must be sought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although one may well drive big businesses with these motives, especially if trafficking in highly charged symbols, our geniuses Albert Einstein and Bucky Fuller have both suggested that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;longing&lt;/span&gt;, even more than vindictive small-mindedness, is a primary motivator of great human achievements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/retooling.html&quot;&gt;that Peace Dividend&lt;/a&gt; we keep expecting, now that a cynical, low-IQ response to everything is going out of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re not in the mood to sucker for another big war right now, even if we&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/spring-cleaning.html&quot;&gt;living like slumdogs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re ready for something better, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that&#39;s true, then we shouldn&#39;t be shy about sketching bold visions of the future, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/smart-cars-2.html&quot;&gt;the more the merrier&lt;/a&gt;, with an eye towards ramping up around some of the more attainable and desirable outcomes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/global-grid-info.html&quot;&gt;the global grid&lt;/a&gt; coming along?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Department of Energy should give us those updates, not make the CIA&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;World Factbook&lt;/span&gt; do all the work.  Why not make it a wiki?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s get those public service asses in gear shall we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And let&#39;s insist on open sourcing digital assets whenever taxpayers are footing the bill.  Give us stuff we can freely build with, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/civilian-technology.html&quot;&gt;like geodesic domes&lt;/a&gt;, like what&#39;s in those other expired patents (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1906781&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;RSA&lt;/a&gt; etc.).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4703746730843033469'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/4703746730843033469'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/recessionology.html' title='Recessionology'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-4340687139002679942</id><published>2009-06-19T13:40:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-22T16:14:01.709-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Unconference</title><content type='html'>The &quot;unconference&quot; borrows from our &quot;unprogrammed Friends&quot; tradition, just as blogs imitate &quot;journaling&quot; -- engineers have been ripping off Quakers for hundreds of years (a joke, as we&#39;ve always had many Q-engineers, check novel &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quaker.org/fqa/types/t10-iron.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Iron Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you don&#39;t believe me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theory here is geeks are among the most agile at working together you&#39;ll ever meet, wired for connectivity from birth, light years ahead of diplomats and even some football players (NFL anyway), so just put us in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3638441947/in/set-72157619963850814/&quot;&gt;a room&lt;/a&gt; (with wifi), give us &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3639252338/in/set-72157619963850814/&quot;&gt;donuts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3639251388/in/set-72157619963850814/&quot;&gt;free water&lt;/a&gt; (a luxury these days) and we&#39;ll hack the hell out of stuff, sprint, develop, dominate the world, and all for just $9.95!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In practice, we&#39;re not all &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/together-friends.html&quot;&gt;together Friends&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and so bumble about a lot, looking for groups to join, tweets to twit about, not always the picture of self-organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my part, I made a bee line to Gabrielle, hanging out with that &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/great-buck-howard-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Amazing Kreskin&lt;/a&gt; guy (&lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/55&quot;&gt;Joshua Keroes&lt;/a&gt;), and informed her I hoped to infiltrate &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/os-bridge-conference.html&quot;&gt;her group&lt;/a&gt; with a couple hand-picked &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/merging-traffic-patterns.html&quot;&gt;elvyn chyx&lt;/a&gt;.  &quot;Not if they&#39;re reporters&quot; she shot back.  Me (feeling wounded): &quot;no, of course not, but what if they&#39;re like bloggers on the side&quot;.  She (still suspicious): &quot;That might be OK&quot;.  Anyway, she had places to go, people to see, so I peeled off at the point, zooming off to the Dragon Boat (more pictures!), thence to within earshot of a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Server Sky&lt;/span&gt; meetup (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3643446294/in/set-72157619963850814/&quot;&gt;hi Keith&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.possepdx.org/&quot;&gt;POSSE meeting&lt;/a&gt; with Howard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to Portland Mayor Sam Adams re your RFP:  we need a new Cubespace, a place where geek user groups are welcome, wifi is free, maybe a food court (indoor carts? dim sum?), definitely beer (nearby if not on the premises).  Big free and open, but with secluded meeting areas, as secret sauces mix with open sources (like a cooking school -- have some of those, so lets copy their ideas).  In Old Town?  Near the Max?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, costs little to dream, loved Eric Sten&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/lucky-lab.html&quot;&gt;render farm&lt;/a&gt;&quot; idea too, maybe combine them somehow?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/revising-pkl-model_115877237186807055.html&quot;&gt;East side&lt;/a&gt;? One idea is to work on civic systems as a group, not just on company stuff e.g. the Oregon Trail chapter of Red Cross is &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/frustrated-with-red-cross.html&quot;&gt;in serious need&lt;/a&gt; of a state of the art website.  We could take that on maybe?  What other NGOs perform vital civic services?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://osgarden.appspot.com/&quot;&gt;OS Garden&lt;/a&gt; is in the cloud but given the death of Jackalope Ubuntu (hardware at fault), I no longer have my local source version in an easily accessible format (SATA HD in carcass).  I was consulting with Cronemeyer on how one backs out an image from the cloud, if the local copy goes away, or is that not a valid symmetry to be pursuing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, &lt;a href=&quot;http://osgarden.appspot.com/motd.html&quot;&gt;the MOTD&lt;/a&gt; will revert to &quot;museum exhibit&quot; for the time being, a souvenir.  Not complaining.  This was a conference worth remembering.  I&#39;m noticing this Toshiba doesn&#39;t have the right fonts, so my &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;I Ching&lt;/span&gt; characters aren&#39;t materializing.  Note to self:  update these fonts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should grab some lunch (BV has wifi).

Microsoft chooses well, whom they wish to put forward as queen of open source, proof they&#39;ve got &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/technation.html&quot;&gt;the right DNA&lt;/a&gt;. They do have a serviceable server-side infrastructure (CodePlex), evolving by leaps and bounds, no question. But do they realize the value of what they&#39;ve got (different question)?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like from my angle, IronPython and some of these other agiles were supposed to give &quot;monkey programmers&quot; a new lease on life, give new meaning to Rapid Application Development (RAD), and yet the expert next to me said &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/portland/2009-June/000759.html&quot;&gt;Visual Studio&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t work with the DLR all that well, so these two flagships are delinking (ouch!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Monkey&quot; is a technical term BTW, means &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mono-project.com/&quot;&gt;Mono&lt;/a&gt;&quot; i.e. dot Net, the Microsoft &lt;a href=&quot;http://bad.debian.net/list/2009-April/003308.html&quot;&gt;Parrot&lt;/a&gt;, so &quot;monkey developer&quot; is not a put down, may actually pay quite well off and on, plus takes some real skills (IronPython is every bit as serious a coding language as CPython).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the loss of Visual Studio to the dinosaur past, my old fogey brain is going &quot;OK so how might we repurpose the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3656357420/&quot;&gt;old VFP9 framework&lt;/a&gt; around IronPython or something like it?&quot; i.e. isn&#39;t quick and easy drag and drop development Microsoft&#39;s trademark, what makes it the Disney of application development? It&#39;d be a pity to lose that, after getting all the &quot;right stuff&quot; under one roof (finally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dunno if you&#39;ll prefer CodePlex, probably use if you&#39;re into vendor lock-in with Microsoft, a pleasant enough experience for many of us. It&#39;s specifically geared to work with their coworker suites, stuff the GNU/Linux people have likely never heard of. CodePlex itself is heavily tested on FireFox, Chrome and the others, so don&#39;t accuse these &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/oscon-9-keynotes-continued.html&quot;&gt;good folks in Redmond&lt;/a&gt; of overly favoring IE. They know what&#39;s out there and know customer satisfaction remains their number one objective. I expect Microsoft will keep reinventing itself successfully so long as they keep this in view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sara is ultra valuable, thanks again for sending her, glad we &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/os-bridge-meeting.html&quot;&gt;went with this talk&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2429584971107581497'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/2429584971107581497'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/welcome-to-codeplex.html' title='Welcome to CodePlex'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-233422995190116142</id><published>2009-06-16T14:04:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-16T14:04:30.911-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Tuesday at Work</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m ramping up for a conference, huddling with Wanderers on some of my slides, also looking forward to music this weekend, the sponsored walk for charity etc. (I have my iPod, but&#39;d rather converse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s an ASCII version of those slides (part of being &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/toc.html&quot;&gt;a pioneer in open source&lt;/a&gt; is developing in the clear like this):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote  style=&quot;font-family:courier new;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;[0] title and opening credits&lt;br /&gt;[1] the geography in question (like a videogame, like Uru by Cyan of Spokane)&lt;br /&gt;[2] blasting a new track (Max tunnel metaphors)&lt;br /&gt;[3] light at the end of the tunnel (sweet jobs in the Silicon Forest)&lt;br /&gt;[4] on the ground (math wars R us)&lt;br /&gt;[5] marketing strategies (private industry mulls &#39;em over)&lt;br /&gt;[6] quick trip through some math topics in Python (yawn)&lt;br /&gt;[7] recap of core strategies, &quot;takeover&quot; of PPS (willing recruits model, merit paid elite crew)&lt;br /&gt;[8] FOSS in Culture (generic themes relevant to the conference)&lt;br /&gt;[9] closing credits, 4D Solutions logo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Some more notes about the day job:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can&#39;t anticipate every &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/patient-tracking.html&quot;&gt;medical measure&lt;/a&gt; future doctors will want to record, but still might have a &quot;best of both worlds&quot; scenario in which instruments &quot;recognize their own handwriting&quot; after finding a signature (some industry standard), at which point the visualization routines kick in and you get something pretty to look at in some proprietary device with open source components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the information harvesting MapReduce engines won&#39;t have trouble with these somewhat open ended stowages, will paw through looking for SQL-ready material.  I&#39;m not suggesting a lot of work for an &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/clinical-research.html&quot;&gt;AI shop&lt;/a&gt;&quot; here though -- people need to consciously instruct their harvesters what to look for, that &quot;steering sense&quot; of relevance (the root meaning of cybernetics) being too expensive to code properly, even if doable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Humans have affordable rates, lets use them instead!&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-April/009236.html&quot;&gt;my standard rant&lt;/a&gt;, whenever they want oodles of noodles for some AI &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/futurism-ii.html&quot;&gt;wrong tree&lt;/a&gt;&quot; that won&#39;t work in ways Sir Roger might explain to ya).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s gonna help with my talk is this switch from analog to digital television recently, in terms of what&#39;s publicly broadcast (not everyone is tied in to proprietary TV channeling ala dish and/or cable).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncle Sam&#39;s plan is somewhat similar to mine, regarding math learning: let&#39;s upgrade, at least in Portland, making the necessary allowances for those other slower cities (not every town is a FOSS capital, let&#39;s admit it (but nor is Portland the only one e.g. Vilnius, Gothenberg... even Chicago)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, time to deposit those checks.  Sad watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3631485574/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CubeSpace&lt;/span&gt; close&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, had to switch my meeting to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lucky Lab&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m stalled on the Pythonic data structure (ISEPP tapes) but not for long probably.  There&#39;s a retreat coming up, with lots of preparations under way.  Sorry to miss ya this time Nirel, and yes Don I know, Father&#39;s Day is this coming weekend, not last weekend (must be that lunar calendar we&#39;re using in our household (wink to Glenn)).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/233422995190116142'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/233422995190116142'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/tuesday-at-work.html' title='Tuesday at Work'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
