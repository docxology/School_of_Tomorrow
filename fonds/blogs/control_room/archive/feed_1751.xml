Any facility that does so, including in North America, should get its satellite picture in the paper for committing crimes against humanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stockpiling such materials is likewise a crime, unless the intent is to secure and eventually destroy them, or render them inaccessible (plans and timeline on file with the IAEA).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any nation allowing such weaponry to proliferate within its own borders is of course a rogue nation harboring terrorists, by definition -- often a sign that the central government is extremely weak and without a serious national security policy (like in Afghanistan).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Histories currently in production will tell the story from this angle: the Iranian government is not alone in being inept against terrorism.

The events were well timed and exceptions minimal. NASA still does great control room. We watched it with Bob Schieffer, a CBS anchor I&#39;ve always liked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is two years after the tragic loss of the previous shuttle, owing to exceptions at launch. This shuttle trip is all about repairing that damage, which many said was evidence of a loss of safety- consciousness at NASA. If true, or even if not, we might use this opportunity to remind ourselves that loss of safety-consciousness is not a phenomenon limited to NASA. Please drive safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now, back to our regularly scheduled programming...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Followup, July 28, 2005&lt;/span&gt;: Per today&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;New York Times&lt;/span&gt; front page, exceptions were &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; minimal as I&#39;d earlier surmised: a big piece of foam broke away from the fuel tank, like last time (although this time it missed hitting the shuttle). So a root cause of the last shuttle disaster hasn&#39;t been fixed.  The launch process is still unacceptably dangerous.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/112239272352696711'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/112239272352696711'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/07/achieving-orbit.html' title='Achieving Orbit'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-112162510806789538</id><published>2005-07-17T11:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:09.264-08:00</updated><title type='text'>More on USA OS</title><content type='html'>I was listening to this guy on public radio last night, trying to persuade us that the founding fathers were for the most part Puritan, that Deists were the exception, not the rule, and that French Enlightenment fathers such as Voltaire, were not the source of the American Revolution, nor behind the establishment of the United States thereof, in the form of two founding documents: the U.S. Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He started teaching us a specific vocabulary around &quot;covenant,&quot; of Biblical origin, for contextualizing the Constitution. What was important to him was to see USA OS as a subprocess of a Christian process, not a fork, and not a separate, secularist process, as if such a thing were possible (how could a process operate without God&#39;s guidance? -- we all need to be started and stopped from within the OS, no?). Gays and lesbians were a special target of his, i.e. we wouldn&#39;t be giving them such liberties were his Xtian OS running the show, and wouldn&#39;t that be agreeable? I didn&#39;t agree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many listeners, my mind shot to the Native Americans, who were already here and doing cyberspace (or spooky governance or whatever the chiefs wanna call it). Europeans had a lot to learn when they got here. The arrogant know-it-alls proved difficult to teach, so why bother? There were plenty wanting to get it, about this place. Ben Franklin for example -- part of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/national-treasure-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;national treasure&lt;/a&gt; (was the radio guy hoping we&#39;d just forget that?). As a scientist cum anthropologist, Ben cared what Native Americans had learned from living in North America for some thousands upon thousands of years. When Mazama blew, they/we knew. Crater Lake. Then in 1980, Mt. St. Helens (which has other names as well). I think we&#39;re all impressed by God&#39;s energy -- way bigger than our own (saw the new &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/span&gt; last night -- Tom had a lot to work through).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to USA OS, I see her as coming a long way since the 1600s, and the East India Company days. The Puritan voice is still heard, most definitely, and the commitment to democracy in their language is strong, and an important part of our heritage, nothing to deny or try to silence in any way. We are grateful for First Amendment principles, which enshrine the sanctity of human speech, about practically any subject, because we value Language as a gift from God (why not? -- why not be thankful? (Atheists and Nontheists, think of God-talk as a grammar for expressing gratitude, but not, thereby, subservience to any other human or human establishment)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We value Puritan speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And we also listen to the American Transcendentalists.  We read &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;No More Secondhand God&lt;/span&gt; by R. Buckminster Fuller. We&#39;re a pretty smart people. Geeky, like the Greeks. Programming an operating system is something we&#39;ll do for breakfast. USA OS is our project, we shield it and give it serious attention, and we&#39;re good at what we do.

(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0391024/&quot;&gt;the movie&lt;/a&gt;) in that both the TV series and the movie are about life in and around a TV control room, the source of a nationally and/or globally syndicated show, in both cases a reality show, but in the TV series case, offered as a comedic fiction scripted by talented screen writers, and revolving around sports, relationships and generally lighter fare. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Control Room&lt;/span&gt;, in contrast, is about war time coverage of extremely violent events -- not sports by a long shot -- and the genre is that of documentary, not clever sitcom, not fiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the writing talent behind &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sports Night&lt;/span&gt; was later behind &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;West Wing&lt;/span&gt;, the fictional series about a president and company in the White House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve found Netflix a good resource for catching up on series I&#39;d missed, what with living overseas, studying a lot in college, holding demanding jobs and so on. I&#39;m way behind on my TV viewing. Never seen a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sopranos&lt;/span&gt; (don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll get to it).  But thanks to Netflix, I&#39;ve worked through some middle seasons of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/span&gt;, and all of season one of the HBO series &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/span&gt; (which has an important cast member in common with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sports Night&lt;/span&gt; by the way).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111844315886758758'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111844315886758758'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/06/sports-night.html' title='Sports Night'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-111808677938965803</id><published>2005-06-06T12:22:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:09.048-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Chaordic Roaming</title><content type='html'>The rolling stock bizmos needn&#39;t be micromanaged from the control room. The itineraries come in the form of options, connecting events according to rule-based searches. If I&#39;ve been to Oswego before, and enjoyed it, chances are I&#39;d like to go again. The option scrolls into view, like in those TV Guide pages. Lots of channels, and I&#39;m holding the remote. This keeps the bizmo crews happier, as there&#39;s not a sense of being coerced into grueling routines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Availability from the various garages needs to be scheduled though. Like airplanes, bizmos are expected to file &quot;flight plans&quot; in advance so that logistics is smooth, redundancy minimized, effectiveness maximized. Some vehicles in our fleet do, in fact, fly, though I&#39;m not aware that anyone has perfected Bucky&#39;s &quot;omni-plummeting device&quot; as Jay Baldwin likes to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bizmos criss-cross the country, connecting to conferences, museums, cultural events (e.g. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Burning Man&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;X-Day&lt;/span&gt;). Plus they convene with each other, in mini-circus conventions, wherein notes and ideas get exchanged. Teachers aren&#39;t all on the same wavelength and specialize in different areas. But to get to this level (of having a bizmo), we presume you&#39;re pretty good, adequately skilled. So there&#39;s a clubby feel to it all, even if we&#39;re not all espousing the same politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem with the USG and energy companies becoming involved.  The NSA has been earning its chops in the ed business, &lt;a href=&quot;http://nbs.nassmc.org/&quot;&gt;tracking lots of articles&lt;/a&gt;. The cryptography link between my math curriculum and RSA is enough to establish a national security credential. USAers want to know this bizmo, giving their kids a good look at cryptography internals, isn&#39;t leaking something vital to their enemies. The decals are reassuring in this regard.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111808677938965803'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111808677938965803'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/06/chaordic-roaming.html' title='Chaordic Roaming'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-111517606179736220</id><published>2005-05-03T20:04:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-07-22T17:00:13.386-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Geodesic Mosques</title><content type='html'>I&#39;ve got a Google News alert set to go off if key words &quot;mosque&quot; and &quot;geodesic&quot; occur in the same article [&lt;a href=&quot;http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2000079,00.html&quot;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, inserted later].

I was still living in Italy back then, attending middle school at the Overseas School of Rome (OSR). Fuller did appear on my radar, briefly, thanks to Fred Craden (my sociology teacher) and company. But I hadn&#39;t tuned in World Game per se -- just the Club of Rome (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.systemdynamics.org/DL-IntroSysDyn/origin.htm&quot;&gt;Jay Forrester&lt;/a&gt; et al), the topic of my 8th grade independent learning project. By 9th grade I&#39;d be in Bradenton, Florida, but only for a semester. Then on to Manila.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hal&#39;s article is amazingly ambitious in scope, taking in Einstein, Heisenberg, Von Neuman, a global electrical grid, and of course Buckminster Fuller, all in one fell swoop. Ah those were the days. Plus we were looking forward to utopia by the 1980s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All these people in their 20s and 30s when this article came out, are now in their 40s and 50s, looking back on a not-so-utopian end of a millenium and start of a new one. So was world game a failure? What other game do we have? Sure, we may be incompetent players (improving?), but the way I see it world game is still the only game in town (locally anyway, in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/podunk&amp;r=67&quot;&gt;podunk&lt;/a&gt; solar system).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I posted some &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/21827&quot;&gt;follow-up comments&lt;/a&gt; to synergeo, but I&#39;m not sure what it takes to access that archive, in terms of joining Yahoo or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to remember to watch &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foreign Exchange with Fareed Zakaria&lt;/span&gt; on OPB in about 30 minutes.

The Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.intel.com/education/isef/&quot;&gt;ISEF&lt;/a&gt;) is the particular one he&#39;s been focusing on.  The stage is set to give his new data visualizations and associated &lt;a href=&quot;http://analyticanimations.com/&quot;&gt;decision support tools&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of science projects, neatly packaged and summarized, appear under one roof, with their authors in tow, and judges have the difficult job of interviewing all the contestants, and then ranking these projects, on a per-discipline basis, in order to hand out prizes and awards of various description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The job is made even more difficult by the fact that no judge sees all the projects in his or her domain, and maybe only one or two other judges has registered a score for any given project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judges will skew their scores based on: what other projects they&#39;ve seen in the fair; their background; their tendency to give generally high or generally low scores (on a scale of 0-100).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David doesn&#39;t try to influence judges. His tools merely summarize and organize their scores more intelligibly, for the benefit of later caucusing. Caucusing is the process which ensues after judges have registered their initial scores, and now need to sort out the top projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&#39;s demonstration involved jellies and jams instead of science projects. Each of 10 judges was assigned the task of scoring six randomly assigned jams and jellies, out of about a dozen samples. The scores were entered into a spreadsheet (the template was already prepared) and emailed from the Pauling House to an associate, who used the data to drive David&#39;s web-based visualizations and decision support tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred Menger, Eve&#39;s brother, and chemistry professor at Emory University, was part of our number this morning. Last night, we heard him speak at Reed College about evolution (room 301, Chemistry building). He thinks the usual criticisms of Neo-Darwinism aren&#39;t all that problematic, but what does seem strange is that this huge, energetically expensive brain would show up, with potentials way in advance of anything we might have needed at the time. What in the environment would select in favor of so many unrealized capabilities? I think the brain has probably paid its own way, in terms of conferring advantages relevant to the era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He went on to suggest the brain supports epigenetic evolutionary processes with Lamarkian properties i.e. some acquired advantages get passed on. I wasn&#39;t sure why he thought the mechanisms needed to involve genetics at all directly, i.e. couldn&#39;t the processes be extracorporeal, e.g. linguistic? For example, cyberspace is making us more responsive without altering the human genome in any direct way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another front, I&#39;ve been working on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/geoquiz.html&quot;&gt;new resource&lt;/a&gt; for the Oregon Curriculum Network, designed to provide insight into how some of the basic infrastructure in cyberspace operates.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111336080972735385'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111336080972735385'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/04/judging-science.html' title='Judging Science'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-111061618121149496</id><published>2005-03-13T20:46:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:08.788-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Statistics Channel</title><content type='html'>The title is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, as no marketing department would entitle a TV channel as such. However, the idea is good: a tape loop of intriguing data visualizations, about big picture matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subject matter might be geological i.e. the timeline might be relatively huge. Like, did you know there was likely an age of &quot;mammals&quot; prior to the age of dinosaurs? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uwei.washington.edu/bookstore/es_ward_gorgon.html&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; is compelling. Also: the comet or asteroid (I forget which) that wiped out the dinos likely hit in the Gulf of Mexico. The tsunami was huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other times, the subjects&#39;d be more contemporary/local, e.g. pictures of the global electrical grid (present and projected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A purpose of this channel is to help humans unify around some common challenges. The carbon dioxide level is global. Just as weather reports help remind people of a local geography, perhaps a national or regional identity, so might a &quot;statistics channel&quot; remind people of Spaceship Earth, and our responsibilities as a species.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111061618121149496'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/111061618121149496'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/03/statistics-channel.html' title='Statistics Channel'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-111031712702364454</id><published>2005-03-08T13:20:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:08.720-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Consolidation Phase</title><content type='html'>The cosmic fishing process involves two major phases (not including maintenance and repair, getting to the site etc.): casting the net, pulling in the net.

A graphical gizmo or gadget we&#39;d like added to this control room: some quasi real time refreshing interface, perhaps a Java applet or XML-backed Flash widget, that gives an accurate picture of rolling &lt;a href=&quot;http://enr.construction.com/news/front2003/archives/030421.asp&quot;&gt;brownouts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1425976,00.html&quot;&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;. If traffic signals are affected, per &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/inside-iraq-untold-stories-movie.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Inside Iraq:  The Untold Stories&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this should receive special mention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This web service could easily be expanded with more graphical gizmos as time goes on, e.g. it&#39;s not just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1220-06.htm&quot;&gt;Baghdad&lt;/a&gt; we care about. There&#39;d be no special authorization required to view it. This information is public, not classified (which doesn&#39;t mean the CIA couldn&#39;t serve it and/or source the information).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once this new web service is in place, we might think of various applications for it. For example, I might propose that for every hour some part of Baghdad is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/articles/16212671?source=Evening%20Standard&quot;&gt;without power&lt;/a&gt;, that the annual income of each USA congressperson automatically drops by one dollar. Of course that&#39;s way too forgiving, plus Congress&#39;d find a loophole in about 10 seconds. So my proposal has symbolic value only. Still, I&#39;d like to see the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;

Dan Rather got it right on David Letterman (2005.3.3): infrastructure, and the state of the Iraqi electrical grid in particular, is the barometer, the key parameter to watch (paraphrasing)&lt;/div&gt;

The degrees of freedom are many, but not so many as to destroy any sense of rules, of a game.  But nor are freedoms so restricted as to make every response &quot;by the numbers&quot; -- a game for AI robots instead of human beings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;War gamers well know that simulations never fully anticipate all the ripple effects of wartime scenarios.  An attack commences, and the avalanche of unintended consequences begins. Then come the ad hoc responses, an attempt to keep some semblance of control over events.  Finding a way to stop a war becomes central -- they&#39;re relatively easy to start, but hard to reign in, once the violence is unleashed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World Game likewise acknowledges the limitations of simulations.  This emphasis on &quot;control rooms&quot; may seem perversely control freaky to some, as they know in their gut that life on the edge of chaos cannot be controlled.  There&#39;s a dance, a set of feedback loops, but it&#39;s ridiculous to suppose any mastermind is on top of everything -- which is why these Dr. Evil paranoias so rarely make any long term sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, given World Game is concerned with building a lot of civilian infrastructure, there&#39;s more confidance going in that the synergies will be positive, whereas war gamers rightly expect increasingly grave situations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Hock of Visa talks a lot about &quot;chaordic&quot; enterprises.  They&#39;re designed to self-organize and spread, but not under anyone&#39;s thumb.  The Internet is another obvious example.  And we&#39;ve seen many positive synergies in both scenarios.  Visa cards are a great invention, even if they&#39;re abused in many cases.  Likewise the Internet has given rise to many unforeseen (plus anticipated) abuses.  Yet in both cases, I&#39;d say the positives far outweigh the negatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I&#39;ll readily admit that I&#39;m not in control, even as I sit here in my control room, enjoying a lot of overview, plus some sense of steering the ship.  I&#39;m a powerful guy, sure, but I&#39;m not masterminding the whole show, any more than any Dr. Evil is able to, from his cybernetic fortress of solitude.  I&#39;m one world game player among many, trying to do my part for the cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To war gamers, I may appear somewhat reckless, in my willingness to trigger avalanche effects, knowing in advance that I&#39;m not going to be in control of them.  But it&#39;s a two way street:  I wonder how war gamers get away with being so cavalier, so blithe, so full of hubris, when their triggering events (e.g. aerial attacks) contain so much violence and pain.  At least I&#39;m not misanthropic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;World Game involves putting a lot of positive artifacts and tools out there, a Johnny Appleseed approach.  Pepper the landscape with goodies, stuff people may find useful.  Then look for ways to switch energy towards these somewhat sketchy circuits, maybe throttling back if unanticipated show stoppers arise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my view, this is how the USG itself got off the ground:  a lot of well-architected infrastructure was implanted and set running.  Over two hundred years later, the resulting controlled chaos is still a source of positive synergy.  But we can&#39;t stop seeding the future.  It&#39;s up to us to plant and nurture, even if we don&#39;t really know what all the ripple effects will be.  That&#39;s just life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if the focus is lasting/sustainable success for omnihumanity (Fuller&#39;s goal), versus myopic &quot;you or me&quot; survival of the most brutish, then the likelihood of reaping a reward vastly increases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your game is death and destruction, you&#39;re basically incompetent and need to be sidelined.  That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m anti-military though.  Defending the long term integrity of the USG, by defending against inferior and undermining ideologies, remains an important aspect of World Game.  The Russians do the same, and more power to &#39;em.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110918458996455537'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110918458996455537'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/02/on-edge-of-chaos.html' title='On the Edge of Chaos'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-110865689727291362</id><published>2005-02-17T11:47:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:08.503-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Simulators in World Game</title><content type='html'>Monitoring global data is one thing. Mandating interventions or corrective maneuvers is quite another. Yet on the bridge of the Enterprise (a federation starship), the captain must do both. It&#39;s not enough just to stand and stare, as everything goes to hell, freezing in a panic or whatever. Fortunately for the Enterprise, Spock is always happy to relieve Kirk of duty, if that&#39;s what it takes (or maybe the Klingons will step in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how shall we develop our captain&#39;s reflexes and conceptual understanding, such that she&#39;s well prepared to respond quickly (or slowly, patiently) as the situation demands? Answer: simulations, dry runs, mock ups, rehearsals. This is what every discipline tends to come up with: some way to allow an apprentice to learn from her mistakes without paying too high a cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NASA learned the importance of simulations long ago. Mission Control would go through the final stages of landing on the moon with the astronauts, and maybe crash the LEM a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of special interest along a critical path are those points of no return. Up to some point, you have abort capability, after which point, you&#39;ve committed. The LEM crew might find itself stuck on the moon, if it chose to commit, then discovered a problem -- hence the importance of check lists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the press of the moment, check lists developed in times of cool, calm clarity often prove a valuable counter to the grip of fear or, potentially as dangerous, the eager thrill to rush onward. Plus there&#39;s just a heck of a lot to remember. Pilots use check lists as a matter of course. On contemporary aircraft, they&#39;re built right into the cockpit display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another form of simulation is field testing. Robotic rovers, designed to explore remote planets, first get a workout on Earth, perhaps in some desert. These tests disclose the limitations of the equipment, plus give remote controllers some all important experience. Sometimes the feedback loop is artifically slowed, given the lag times associated with what will eventually be the real time distances between pilots and robots. The speed of light is finite, after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/geni3.html&quot;&gt;World Game&lt;/a&gt; has always featured simulations. A gymnasium-sized world map would be unrolled, and participants assigned roles, as diplomats, journalists, heads of state, corporate executives. The clock would start, and players would swing into action, trying to self-organize human affairs on a global scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, the scenario would end in disaster, and one of the trainers, e.g. Chuck Dingée, would come out with the buckets of red poker chips, each symbolizing the blast and/or fallout radius of a nuclear explosive. There&#39;d be enough chips to effectively cover most of the map&#39;s landmasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Players would survey the damage and feel relieved that this was only a test. As they walked out the door into the bright sunlight, the trainers would remind them: now world game begins for real.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110865689727291362'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110865689727291362'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/02/simulators-in-world-game.html' title='Simulators in World Game'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-110801694147819051</id><published>2005-02-09T22:45:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2014-10-25T17:47:11.128-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The Mapparium</title><content type='html'>Any control room worth its salt has global data displays in the round, simulations of the planet. A flat map of the world then derives from this globe via some projection algorithm, of which we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/map/dymax.html&quot;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the more interesting control rooms I&#39;ve visited is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.marybakereddylibrary.org/exhibits/mapparium.jhtml&quot;&gt;Mapparium&lt;/a&gt; in Boston. All these years later I still treasure my Korea-made vinyl Mapparium tote bag, my one souvenir from that nuclear disarmament conference I attended on behalf of the AFSC.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Mapparium is this walk-through globe, 30 feet in diameter, with backlit glass panels providing a view of the oceans and continents, plus an overlay of political data. Off to the side, there&#39;s a situation room with a desk and additional monitoring equipment (I&#39;m hazy on the details). Christian Scientists want overview and spent big money to get it ($8,900 in 1935). And why not? More power to &#39;em.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In science fiction movies, such control rooms may belong to some nefarious master mind, some Dr. Evil with a plan for world domination. We want the good guys (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/team-america-world-police-movie-review_04.html&quot;&gt;our team&lt;/a&gt;) to have a slick control room, but maybe not the competition. Overview is a strategic asset. If Dr. Evil has better overview than you do, well better call batman or 007 or someone who will put those bad guys out of business -- and that usually means a thrilling climax with lots of explosions, or at least some hand-to-hand combat. The situation may look rather dim for our hero at times, which adds to the suspense. We all know the formula. Hollywood has it down pat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Critical Path&lt;/span&gt;, Fuller sketched an outdoor geoscope, 200 feet in diameter, that&#39;d be &quot;highly visible to occupants of the UN building as well as to all those in New York City in the vicinity of Fiftieth Street.&quot; (pg. 175) His original idea for the Montreal &#39;67 Expo Pavilion was likewise geoscopic -- a flat map transforming into a globe every so often. World Game computers would illuminate its many bulbs with various overlays, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/our-land.html&quot;&gt;billboard&lt;/a&gt; style.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both projects had a psychological dimension, which was precessionally important even though neither was actually implemented: instead of locking his global data displays in some spooky, secret cave, accessible only to those with high level clearances, he was projecting onto very public surfaces. Every UN diplomat would know that every other UN diplomat was seeing. That in itself was a revolutionary aspect of his design.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today we&#39;d call it &quot;free and open source global data.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;

He and I are Plone afficionados -- like, we both attended that sprint with &lt;a href=&quot;http://plone.org/Members/runyaga&quot;&gt;Alan Runyaga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zopezen.org/&quot;&gt;Andy McKay&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria that time. He wants to do some global data displays using Plone, in collaboration with a biodiesel guy I haven&#39;t met yet. They might need my help in some way. Sounds like fun.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On another front, I met a former webmaster with &lt;i&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/i&gt; (Consoletti introduced us). He reminded me that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sesameworkshop.org/sesamestreet/coloringpages/view.php?contentId=3023&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;Grover&lt;/a&gt; (a kid favorite) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda&quot;&gt;Yoda&lt;/a&gt; (the Jedi Knight), are the same guy, Frank Oz (just like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00016XO6U&quot;&gt;Big Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iridis.com/Oscar_the_Grouch&quot;&gt;Oscar the Grouch&lt;/a&gt; are both performed by Carroll Spinney). This webmaster has also worked as a counselor with navam kids.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I still remember those posters that came out after 911, with Osama Bin Laden in the foreground, and in the background: &lt;a href=&quot;http://dc-mrg.english.ucsb.edu/conference/2002/documents/mark_poster.html&quot;&gt;Evil Burt&lt;/a&gt;. I took a screen shot of that in my brief case when I flew off to the east coast in October of 2001, to visit (among others) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kennethsnelson.net/&quot;&gt;Kenneth Snelson&lt;/a&gt; in Manhatten and Stuart Quimby&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.blogger.com/null&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;in upstate New York; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/news/ci_2548142&quot;&gt;spark of humor&lt;/a&gt; in a very dark time.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s the time Ken gave me &lt;i&gt;Barrel Tower&lt;/i&gt;, a fantastic gift that sits proudly in my office. I had to get it back through airline security at EWR (too big for the metal detector, and besides, it&#39;s all metal, so what&#39;s to detect?).

That&#39;s been a political ideal earning lip service, but now it&#39;s also an engineering requirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oft times, money talk tends to dumb down an otherwise &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thenation.com/thebeat/index.mhtml?bid=1&amp;pid=2160&quot;&gt;coherent narrative&lt;/a&gt; and slow its advance by keeping our attention misdirected. Once it&#39;s all about money, expect plenty of fast talk and sleights of hand. Remember the dot com revolution and how quickly any real information about the technology was submerged in BS? Hey, we&#39;ve had centuries to practice and fine tune the discourse (me like the next guy -- so pay close attention (now you see it, now you don&#39;t)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/file_on_4/4216853.stm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BBC&lt;/a&gt; is reporting $9 billion unaccounted for by the Coalition Provisional Authority. The chaos of war provides a convenient excuse many hope will serve as their cover indefinitely. Money pads private accounts, no work gets done, the infrastructure decays, soldiers and civilians get killed, and terrorism is to blame. Welcome to the United States of America, folks -- or were we discussing Iraq?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We geeks in our open source control rooms know to keep our eyes on the prize: good clear information, circuit diagrams, blueprints, flow charts, hard core scientific models. Like, where &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; those generators and what are their specs, and why aren&#39;t they working? Could a neighboring grid pick up the slack? Why all these rolling brownouts and fuel shortages month after month? Because of terrorism right? Nothing to do with willful obfuscation, aiming to make out like bandits behind the scenes, to capitalize on the suffering of others, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, this is not an &quot;us versus them&quot; story about little guys versus giants. As uplifting and inspirational as David&#39;s story might be, the fact is that many goliaths are alert to the possibilities. We could actually make this work, so why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus we geeks have a lot of street smarts and savvy. We&#39;re holding a lot of cards. We really have the upper hand in so many ways. Like, we have the Internet, we have Google. We&#39;re Morlocks after all, not Eloi, as Neal Stephenson aptly puts it (see: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=in+the+beginning+was+the+command+line&amp;amp;btnG=Google+Search&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;In the Beginning Was the Command Line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -- it&#39;s worth a read).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110723216504401376'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110723216504401376'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/make-sense-not-war.html' title='Make Sense Not War'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10436423.post-110710042656227006</id><published>2005-01-30T08:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2017-03-29T11:35:59.592-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Total Information Awareness</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4LtYMNl4yw&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this highly effective &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=-4LtYMNl4yw&quot;&gt;ACLU ad&lt;/a&gt;, some hapless netizen phones to order pizza and gets more than he bargained for: an encounter with big brother (or big sister in this case). And she&#39;s right of course: he should lay off the double meat, given that waist line and medical history -- although she&#39;ll allow the transgression if he signs a release from the HMO (expensive!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Part of what makes this encounter seem so unfair is the pizza lady holds all the cards. Our would-be consumer knows nothing about his order-taker inquisitor. The violation of privacy is entirely one-sided. This suggests an important principle: to the extent that we &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; moving towards total information awareness (no one really knows the future), it shouldn&#39;t be about empowering Obnoxico (Fuller&#39;s term) at the expense of the average citizen. Here at Global Data, we don&#39;t just work for pointy-headed geeks named Poindexter. We work for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;, the average pizza lover.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In my view, the average citizen is still sovereign. Like, go ahead and pig out on pizza if that&#39;s your karma, provided you allow for the rights of your neighbors (they don&#39;t have to watch, nor care if you kill yourself). Corporations on the other hand, being not human, don&#39;t have the same rights to privacy, especially the really big ones working closely with planetary infrastructure. The public has a right to know what these big name players are up to, given we&#39;ll all pay the consequences of bad decision making, and so increasing transparency is the name of the game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I learned these values in the open source community, wherein I&#39;ve taken an active role (like, why trust your life to source code they won&#39;t show you?) -- but also from Uncle Sam. The American commitment to freedom of information is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; about providing exclusive and one-sided advantages to tiny elites, anonymous shareholders in their gated communities, or to military planners with fantasies of global domination. The commitment is to serve &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; of the people. That&#39;s why top management at Global Data has such love and respect for the Smithsonian Institution and the National Geographic Society -- and Google. And yes, we think the ACLU is pretty cool too.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110710042656227006'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10436423/posts/default/110710042656227006'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/total-information-awareness.html' title='Total Information Awareness'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/-4LtYMNl4yw/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry></feed>
