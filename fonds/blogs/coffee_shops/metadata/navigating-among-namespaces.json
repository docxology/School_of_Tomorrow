  "content": "Some of the most uber-orthogonally minded are eager to treat Fuller's 4D as some kind of \"tesseract\" straw man (as if Synergetics were merely an offshoot of their own orthodox thinking). \n\nThen, once put on this false pedestal, they can tear it down as not politically correct enough, from a hypercross dogmatists' viewpoint.\u00a0\n\nEither that or they think he's aping Einstein.\n\nIt's a vapid philosophical position that never held much water, and one I'm always happy to dispel.",
