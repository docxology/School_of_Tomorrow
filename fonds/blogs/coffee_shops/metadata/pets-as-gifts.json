  "content": ":: emperor with no clothes,Disney character, via Kipling ::\n\nInquiries about giving out live animals, including with award ceremonies, need not be directed to some nebulous CSN \"global hub\" as we really care more about local community standards, are more like Ben & Jerry's in that way ([Unilever](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/wanderers-20081119.html)).  Pet policies cannot be set from on high, by some emperor with no clothes (see above).\n\nGiven the high cost of fuel, running empty is a waste, and lots of salt water aquariums could be heading into Kabul, feeding a growing network of tropical fish huts in that area.  If the local coffee shops wanna jump in, who's to stop 'em?\n\nRemember when [Keiko](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/one-whale-of-wanderer.html) got to ride on a military type aircraft, or at least cargo freight?  Keiko was the star of Free Willy and needed to see the world, especially Norway.  Likewise, staff in the Iraqi version of [Sea World](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-bday-sarah.html) might want to move around, rotate.  A few hours in a saltwater tank can't be that bad, if done right.  \"Take her through Manas!\" could be the order of the day.\n\n[Extracting heavy weapons](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/slowing-down.html) takes time, so as long as we have \"air ships\" running both ways, lets stock some shops, get that stimulus happening.  Christmas in July is blatantly about civilian gift giving.",
