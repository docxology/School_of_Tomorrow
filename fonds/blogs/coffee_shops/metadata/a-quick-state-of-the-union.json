  "content": "This blog evolves rather slowly compared to the several others I write for.\u00a0 Hello, I'm the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) for this non-existent yet nascent network of coffee shops, emblematic of Philosophy (French influence) and of intellect more generally.\u00a0 Portland, Oregon is a great place to experience the culture, but so is Rome, Italy.\n\nI'm not clamoring to be a Church although that's probably the easiest way to get an easement in some of the controlled substances acts, but this is not about rushing communities to accept new standards.\u00a0 If you want to experiment, try a cruise ship or charter maybe, but make sure your captain and crew don't drink the kool-aid, whatever that may be, i.e. there's a line between those experiencing the show, and those putting on the show (staff and guests, thespians and audience, newscasters and news viewers).\n\nI mention controlled substances (like alcohol and tobacco) because the next think you imagine I'll talk about is gambling.\u00a0 They go together right?\u00a0 But then your Church basement was typically smoke filled, i.e. consenting adults are allowed to make wagers in some game of chance like context.\u00a0 It's the shape of that wagering that states like to control.\u00a0 Can you bet on dogs?\u00a0 Off track?\u00a0 I barely know what that means.\u00a0 You had people \"running numbers\" in all the old cop shows.\u00a0 What were they doing exactly.\u00a0 Ask an anthropologist.\n\nBut yes, I'm going to mention games of change and skill both, arcade game style and other, wired up to donate to charities.\u00a0 Yes you can do this from home.\u00a0 Generous people right now are playing games to give money.\u00a0 My late wife assiduously played a few each day.\u00a0 Small amounts were presumably being made, to feed the hungry, to save the wolves, that kind of thing.\n\nThe business plan here is the product sellers, the brands behind the counter, are using games to help build brand loyalty and brand recognition.\u00a0 The whiskey company maybe doesn't own the rights to the game inside, but the company logo is still a game element, product placement one could say.\u00a0 Companies aren't bound to stay literal.\u00a0 If an elephant is your mascot, why not go with that?\n\nPatrons may pony up their own funds, but a lot of turns at play are sponsored.\u00a0 Getting that Voodoo Donut includes a spin or two of the wheel, or maybe something more involved.\u00a0 The point is you're engaged in an heroic episode at the same time the sponsor is pledging your winning to charity.\u00a0 That's actually a potent mix.\u00a0 Doing well to do good.\u00a0 People enjoy that kind of challenge, with or without a Coffee Shop setting.\n\nYou could say the point is to give ordinary people a sense of what it's like to be a philanthropist and give generously, changing the course of human events thereby.\u00a0 We can't all expect to steer at the same level in the same way, but a game with the point of giving, and requiring at least virtual heroics, is potentially quite exciting.\u00a0 One could say giving to charity is addictive in this new form, but if that's the case, I can think of worse forms of addiction.\u00a0 Lets have this form of addiction (unable to stop charitably giving) be a new problem, one we'd like to have.",
