  "content": "Talking philosophy with Ivana, Epistemology group.\n\nIvana: and what about the mind then?:D Who controls it? Isn't it a product of brain activity?\n\nMe: I\u2019d say there\u2019s no global universal meaning to these terms \u201cbrain\u201d and \u201cmind\u201d. Sure, \u201cbrain\u201d is the name of that fatty organ in the skull, we all know that, but the meaning of that word stretches far beyond such denotations e.g. look at \u201cPepsi\u201d \u2014 so much more than a dark carbonated sugary juice in a bottle. Think of the bottle as the skull. Then think of the PR army that makes Pepsi compete with Coke. The logo alone is a major signifier. We don\u2019t have widely accepted icons (logos, brands) for each organ, but we could (some part of Unicode). That\u2019d change the meaning of brain, the way I think of meaning. \u00a0\n\nIn the case of \u201cmind\u201d, the situation is even more clear: no specific organ need be referenced (although one might be). It all depends on the local namespace we\u2019re in i.e. \u201cwho is talking?\u201d. For example, a namespace I\u2019m steeped in draws an important distinction between \u201cbrain\u201d and \u201cmind\u201d and develops these differences through various published titles \u2014 not Foucault, not Derrida, and not theosophy, although developed contemporaneously with the Gurdjieff-Ouspensky stuff.\u00a0\n\nLet me say here that I consider \u201cbrain\u201d and \u201cmind\u201d two very different words and it\u2019s a waste of good English to conflate them to mean the same thing i.e. to use them as synonyms. \u201cIs your world really so simple that you can afford to erase that distinction?\u201d Is the kind of questions I\u2019d have upon encountering such an alien namespace.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m also influenced by Freud and the psychoanalytic movement, which I trace back to Nietzsche in many dimensions. But that\u2019s just me. I wouldn\u2019t claim that my usage patterns match those of your random epistemologist. A lot depends on one\u2019s ontology (I\u2019ll conflate \u201contology\u201d with \u201cvocabulary\u201d in this paragraph).",
