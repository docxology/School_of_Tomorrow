Buckminster Fuller in his \"explorations in the geometry of thinking\" (or \"synergetics\" for short).\u00a0 A \"highway\" between \"places\" may be a transformation, such as the Jitterbug Transformation, or, as above, a simple resizing.\n\nSuperRT:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 21.2132034\nVE\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (edge 2):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 20.0000000\nIcosa (edge 2):\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 18.5122959\nSmallGuy:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15.8606454\nRD6:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 6.0000000\nRT5+:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.0077580\nRT5:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5.0000000 \n\nSmallGuy will seem an idiosyncratic name, but then maps often contain folk names.\u00a0 \"SuperRT\" is a rhombic triacontahedron scaled up by phi from its original size of 120 E-modules, a shape well-defined in Synergetics.\u00a0 Said SuperRT embeds our Icosa of edges two as its long diagonals.\u00a0 This same Icosa intersects and shares facial area with SmallGuy.\n\nIn sum SmallGuy, in this map, is a cuboctahedron \"half way between\" (edge-wise) the rt2-edge cuboctahedron and the phi-times-rt2-edge or say (rt2)(phi)/2 is the scale factor.\u00a0 Starting with the same SmallGuy volume and multiplying by the sFactor * sFactor gets us the Icosa of edges 2 in volume, whereas one more application of the sFactor gets us the Cuboctahedron of volume 20, edges 2 (at the start of our Jitterbug Transformation).\n\nUsing some rational approximations in the Python shell:\n\n>>> 15.8606454 * 1.0803630269509035 * 1.0803630269509035\n18.512295822967804\n\n>>> 18.512295822967804 * 1.0803630269509035\n19.999999951112063\n\nThat's SmallGuy * sFactor * sFactor = Icosahedron (a volume expression)\nIcosahedron * sFactor = Cuboctahedron (same edge lengths as Icosahedron)\n\nNote that we're using tetravolumes as our standard (same as Synergetics).\u00a0 Four unit radius spheres closest pack to define a tetrahedron of edges 2R (1D) and volume one.\u00a0 The Icosahedron of volume ~18.51 and cuboctahedron of volume 20 both have edges of this same length (2R).\n\n[Another \"harmonizing\" to map](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/05/interlacing-test-pattern.html) is the edge-crossing of the rhombic dodecahedron of volume six, Kepler's favorite space-filler and a \"voronoi cell\" for our unit radius spheres, and the volume 7.5 rhombic triacontahedron, inflated (scaled) by a factor of 1.5 from it's T-module beginnings.\n\nThe T- and E-modules have a \"same shape\" relationship with the E a tad larger in size (T-volume is 1/24).\u00a0 The sFactor, used above, is the ratio of the S-module to the E-module or about 0.045084/0.041731.\u00a0 More output from [a Python program](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2014-May/011026.html):\n\nAmod volume = : 0.04166666666666668\nBmod volume = : 0.041666666666666595\nEmod volume = : 0.04173131692777366\nTmod volume = : 0.04166666666666668\nSmod volume = : 0.045084971874737034\n================\nsFactor (Svol/Evol) =    1.0803630269509035",
