  "content": "I joined a bunch of Meetups on Meetup.com to ring in the new year, and in so doing found out about the Portland World Game meetup.\n\nThe group was staging a \"positive protest\" (not against anything) that very day, New Year's Day, in the South Park blocks.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/24028980261/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nI was on a tight schedule so only managed a few shots during \nthe setup phase.\u00a0 I got into a conversation with a guy, only four months\n in Portland, about how prolific Fuller was (the genius behind the World\n Game meme).\u00a0 Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth was one of his[ more influential titles](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/12/global-data-global-matrix.html).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/23483336634/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nI pointed to the nearby Arlington Club as where Ed and June Applewhite had stayed, [when visiting Portland](https://flic.kr/p/nJ229A) in the 1990s.\u00a0 Ed was Fuller's chief collaborator on the two [Synergetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_%28Fuller%29) volumes.\u00a0 He wrote [Cosmic Fishing](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmic-Fishing-Account-Synergetics-Buckminster/dp/0025027107) to chronicle that experience.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/24085503726/in/dateposted-public/)",
