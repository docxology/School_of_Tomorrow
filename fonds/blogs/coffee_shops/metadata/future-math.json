In fact, this idea, so attractively developed by H.G. Wells in The Time Machine, has led such authors as J. W. Dunne (An Experiment with Time) into a serious misconception of the theory of Relativity. Minkowski's geometry of space-time is not Euclidean, and consequently has no connection with the present investigation.\u00a0 (Dover Publications, 1973)\nDonald's [relationship with Fuller](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/quick-account.html), another spinner of 4D, was somewhat inevitable in hindsight, and might be characterized as \"stormy at first, smoothing out into friendship\".\n\nA first point of contention was around intellectual property, around radomes in particular.\u00a0 The US military honored a US patent in contracting with Fuller's firms for DEW line radomes, situated in Canada.\n\nDonald's son, a Canadian, was hoping to break in to the radar dome business and came up against not owning the relevant patent.\u00a0 Donald went ballistic, thinking such a fundamental geometry of nature would really have to be open source.\n\nFuller's having patented the octet truss, in addition to the geodesic dome, likely didn't improve matters.\u00a0 Both are found all over the place in naturally occurring physical objects.\n\nThe softening in their relationship came with the [Montreal Expo '67 geodesic dome](https://findery.com/maggie/notes/montreal-biosphre-fire-1976), a marvel to behold and huge.\u00a0 Coxeter eventually agreed to let Fuller dedicate Synergetics to him.\u00a0 Synergetics is where Fuller's use of 4D is made clear.\u00a0 Bucky writes:\n\n527.702\n Geometers and \"schooled\" people speak of length, breadth, and height as\n constituting a hierarchy of three independent dimensional states \n--\"one-dimensional,\" \"two-dimensional,\" and \"three-dimensional\" -- which\n can be conjoined like building blocks. But length, breadth, and height \nsimply do not exist independently of one another nor independently of \nall the inherent characteristics of all systems and of all systems' \ninherent complex of interrelationships with Scenario Universe. \n\n... \n\n527.712 All conceptual consideration is inherently four-dimensional. \nThus the primitive is a priori four-dimensional, being always comprised \nof the four planes of reference of the tetrahedron. There can never be \nany less than four primitive dimensions. Any one of the stars or \npoint-to-able \"points\" is a system-ultratunable, tunable, or infratunable but inherently four-dimensional.\n\nCoxeter was also impressed by Fuller's discovery of the cuboctahedron number sequence, 1, 12, 42, 92, 162 and so on, his [formula for generating](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica2.html#top) this sequence, and generalizable to other shapes.\u00a0 Clearly Fuller was doing his own thinking to some high degree.\n\nIn computer science we now have the concept of \"namespace\" which is equivalent to the humanities notion of \"context\".\u00a0 For example in Python a namespace may be a module, saved in storage as a Python script.\n\nThe meaning given to the various names in a script will become evident at runtime.\u00a0 Likewise in the humanities we appreciate that [authors have their own unique ways](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/05/more-adventures.html) of using certain words, which both borrow from and contribute to shared usage patterns.\n\nDisentangling the meanings of 4D is important to future math, and to one's level of cultural literacy.\u00a0 Our Coffee Shops Network has the LCD reveries that help boost one's understanding of these many nuances and subtleties.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBhzHlryoAGmuLoo86rTii-ggYnQv5XVYwKG9nWoazstrmx83m2liKtlMmvg8wgN7xLhYhZ6IJY0sJde-lIatqp3mGAwKQ_GW4eyYj4PKzoNXOaKotutDyp34T9BU-BxO_z7knDoqxpl0/s1600-h/tetship.gif)\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjJZPqeCCD7AAPr17mUY30H8ekyydCh6kdzzmPDC18NVolnq-ynEPo4hF5EXc3RdCWfE_usC_5owYogN-gvB60ZsQAsZyFHjf6f-WQU0WpSSea1LrpnqA7nyvu8-uqvXzRzGnqXhdhkhqk/s1600-h/tetship1.jpeg)by [Hollister (Hop) David](http://clowder.net/hop/index.html) \n(with attribution to me)",
