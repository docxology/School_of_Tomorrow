  "content": "These [Mandelbulb fly throughs](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/06/at-toms.html) have been important to me as I contemplate the relationship between CSN bars and the flipped classrooms of adulthood, with the childhood corollaries.\n\nYou want a safe enough space to immerse yourself in arcana if need be, because in obscure Chinese herbs you may find a cure, or so goes the promise of the archetypal apocathery.\n\nThe remedy may as well be metaphysical, and the right studies (and/or left), with aesthetics, will have power to spin you out of a slump, just as other metaphysics may have helped get you into one.\n\nSo stay on your guard, or develop one if you have none.\n\nIn the earlier 21st century we have the paradox of people attempting to drive places in ways that not only squander fuel, but pose significant risk to their personal and financial health.\n\nThey pack the freeways in blizzards.\u00a0 Is this an intelligent species?\u00a0 There's strong evidence to the contrary.\n\nAs a subset of this mad need for travel, people who make a major commitment to paying off a home cannot then afford to enjoy them without leaving them empty half the time, as partners commute and children board a bus to some loud and competitive place wherein viewing Mandelbulb videos is probably not a big pass time.\n\nFractals aren't much mentioned, despite the spike in interest awhile back.\u00a0 We need to study those spikes more.\u00a0 Intellectual history is a glue, and not just for the over-specialized.\u00a0 STEM needs a bigger slice of the news, more air time in the media.\u00a0 Lets work on that.",
