Without rigid reinforcement, the hardened sludge has little value as a load-bearing material, but is conventional rebar the only option?\n\nWith Flextegrity, based on the CCP matrix, the designer has more control over both rigidity and volumetric displacement.\u00a0 As cinder blocks prove, there's plenty of space, for space, in many an over-built design.\n\nConsider C6XTY, made of rigidly interconnected hollow balls.\u00a0 The total displacement is less than 74% of the total space (the pure CCP figure) but how much less?\u00a0 A lot more than what rebar would occupy.\u00a0\n\nA savings of 50% in concrete, while adding strength, might be just the ticket, given the right truss.\n\nWhat schools of engineering are studying the combination of concrete and lattice trussworks?\u00a0\n\nIs your construction company in the loop?\n\nHere at Coffee Shops Network (CSN), we specialize in hypertoon reveries (spaghetti balls of connected scenarios) and the CCP (= FCC) is a kind of homebase for our explorations.\n\nOf course we follow C6XTY, a set of stories, and Flextegrity, given our specialty.\n\nThanks to Lattice Gallery in Portland, Oregon for popping up during the holidays and showing Portlanders some of the possibilities.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/48745994321/in/album-72157710244744097/)",
