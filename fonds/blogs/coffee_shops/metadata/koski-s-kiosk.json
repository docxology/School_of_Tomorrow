A tetrahedral voxel within a family consisting of family members E&T, S, A&B. Or these could be subway lines.\n\nAt the stations, the Kiosks appear as actual newstands with \"read all about it\" headlines regarding the Koski Identities.\u00a0\n\nPicturing like Japanese anime, hypertoons with chill beats.",
