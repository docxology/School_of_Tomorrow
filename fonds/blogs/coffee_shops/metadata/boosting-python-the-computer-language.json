Imitation: the sincerest form of flattery, right?\n\nSo yes, that's an example of me \"boosting Python\" i.e. casting about for mnemonic techniques that might help cement the language in one's thinking.\u00a0 \"Python fits your brain\" (sells itself) to begin with in this regard, so I don't have the uphill battle some in the language arts might face.\n\nI've also looked at where Python already has a niche in western hemispheric lore, now spread to the world thanks to Disney.\u00a0 Apollo and Athena, both Greek deities (superheros) stood for different value systems, as did (does) Dionysus. A lot of English and German language lit explored the Apollonian versus Dionysian spectrum, leaving Athena to her own devices.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/42833683820/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nHowever, in ancient Greek lore, Apollo goes after the Python under Mt. Parnassus, the residence for the Delphi Oracles, which originally worshipped Athena.\u00a0 Their oracular powers somehow derived from the Python.\n\nWe might see Apollo's aggression as an act of hostile takeover.\u00a0 We might let the snake get away from him in some versions, a fork I explore in my \"escaped to Nashville\" meme.\n\nWe all know Athena's mascots or familiars include both Python and Nike. Her statue in Nashville's Parthenon reminds us of these facts.\n\nHere in Portland, Oregon, I live not far from the Nike headquarters of \"Just Do It\" fame (one of its advertising slogans), so why not consciously imitate with a \"Just Use It\" for Python?\u00a0\n\nI've used that myself in some ASCII art output \"on the farm\" (we use Tractor and Field objects).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30753619828/in/dateposted-public/)",
