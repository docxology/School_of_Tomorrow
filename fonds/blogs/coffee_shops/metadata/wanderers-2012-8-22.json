  "content": "David DiNucci, the computer scientist, was asking me about where I did [Wanderers write-ups](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/wanderers-2008129.html). \u00a0Mostly in three other blogs, but why not do something different?\n\nI've presented the basics of Coffeeshops Casinos or whatever we call them, a few times at Wanderers, which meets in a boyhood home of the Nobel Prize winning Linus Pauling (February 28, 1901 \u2013 August 19, 1994)).\n\nDavid has written a book on concurrency to help people think about the challenges of programming many processes to run in parallel, an exercise often undertaken, in life outside electronic computing.\n\nMy top people in this organization are people I consider top ranking. \u00a0They represent characteristics I would want in chiefs of some company, staff or tribe.\n\nOur topics were free ranging as usual. \u00a0Jon Bunce brought [one of his comical drawings](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/7841709734/in/photostream) from the 1980s. \u00a0I thought it was excellent. \u00a0Glenn had three books he's recently purchased.\n\nThere's only partial overlap twixt Wanderers and those whom I describe as my chiefs, with me chief marketing officer or CMO.\n\nThe CEO is entirely fictional and/or mythical, [like a deity](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/10/subgenius-devival.html), so of course that means we cannot be a \"white man LLC\" i.e. a post Civil War corporation with personhood. \u00a0The CEO is manifestly a white man though, by the name of Dobbs, smokes a pipe.\n\nYou could call this a placeholder business or emulator (similar to incubator). \n\nYou might spin out a business based on the open source templates presented here. \u00a0Others might do the same, but differently.",
