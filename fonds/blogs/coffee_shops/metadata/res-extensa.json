A. Schilpp, Evanston, Illinois, pp. 459-474.\n\nFor further reading:\n\n[About Karl Menger](http://www.iit.edu/csl/am/about/menger/about.shtml) (Illinois Institute of Technology)\n[Small World](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/small-world.html) (Grain of Sand, Aug 11, 2007)\n[Claymation Station](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/10/claymation-station.html) (Grain of Sand, Oct 3, 2008)\n[Re: 4D vs. 4D vs. 4D](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/glass-bead-game.html) (Coffee Shops Network, Feb 7, 2009)\n[Proposal Re: Dimension](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/proposal-re-dimension.html) (Grain of Sand, Jan 12, 2009)\n\n[Egoistic Writing on 4D](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/63677) (Synergeo, Nov 27, 2010)\n\n[Marketing CSN @ Math Forum](http://www.mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7341556&tstart=0) (math-teach, Dec 23, 2010)\n[STEM and Euclid's Geometry](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2327345&tstart=0) (math-teach, Dec 26, 2011)\n[Re: A Question about Straight Lines](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9373270) (math-teach, Jan 27, 2014)",
