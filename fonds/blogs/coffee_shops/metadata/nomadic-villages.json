  "content": "How does CSN inter-operate with the \"nomadic village\" initiative?\u00a0 Remember the purpose of CSN:\u00a0 to provide opportunities for philanthropic investments.\n\nCompanies allow their customers to rise towards stardom as players in various computer games that pay out to board-approved worthy causes.\n\nProfit-sharing includes building an asset called Good Will in traditional economics textbooks.\u00a0 How this gets done is an evolving process, affected by innovations in software and hardware.\n\nDonations to charitable causes adds to a company's PR.\u00a0 Corporate persons express their values through their patterns of funding, a form of image-making.\n\nValving donations through micro-investments made by customers, as facilitated by the Coffee Shops Network, makes for a more open environment, as players share their profiles and portfolios.\n\nNomadic villages are designed with a TTL (time to live) in any given site, after which they fold up their tents (figuratively speaking, though some do use actual tents) and move on.\n\nSome villages maintain their identity when they move, while others fork and branch.\n\nThe thinking behind the architecture is different when a village is designed from the ground up to be nomadic.\u00a0 How small a footprint is left behind?\u00a0 What traces are left?\n\nWhat goes into making a village mobile?\u00a0 The idea of a caravan, gypsy wagons, hippie buses, suggests a \"traveling road show\".\u00a0 What goes by shipping container.\u00a0 Do helicopters have a role?\n\nAnother model is more \"World's Fair\" in that usable infrastructure is left behind by intent.\u00a0 Landscaping.\u00a0 An airstrip and/or helipad.\u00a0 A next village will occupy the same digs, but with different gear.\n\nA typical mindset when it comes to \"new settlements\" is open-ended longevity, whereby structures get built with no plan for their eventual demolition and/or removal.\u00a0 The \"nomadic village\", in contrast, is at a location on a schedule, with start and end times.\n\nWhen villages are choreographed to move around, like cruise ships, but with less cohesion, the technology becomes more agile.\u00a0 Weight and structural integrity matter more.\n\nAs a matter of logic, refugee camps would be among the first in line to test prototypes.",
