  "content": "Buckminster Fuller Explains Why Politics Is Obsolete\n\nHumans mostly chose to stick with their scapegoat political leaders because (a) they're used to having scapegoats and (b) political leaders need to project some sense of their political power.\u00a0 Symbiosis at work.The book [The End of Power](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/04/earth-day-2017.html) suggested this time-honored arrangement might become unsustainable soon, and was coming to an end. A new equilibrium would be the outcome.Although Fuller had laid some groundwork for a transcending maturation process, most of academia decided his unit volume tetrahedron and whole number volumes approach to rationality could be abandoned without much debate. They made a choice on our behalf.Those of us keeping the debate alive seemed to have few friends in high places. A few is enough sometimes though, especially when said friends are not politicians.",
