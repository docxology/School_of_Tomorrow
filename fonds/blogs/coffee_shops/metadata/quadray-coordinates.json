Quadrays are shown in blue.\n\nHowever the size of this cube is \"all face diagonals = 2\" which means the so-called \"basis vectors\" (four of them) are not \"unit\" in length.\u00a0 What's more important, for a starting place, is that the edges of this canonical tetrahedron have all edges 2.\u00a0 We might call this the \"basis tetrahedron\" (or \"home base\").\n\nWhat is this cube of face diagonals 2 relative to in terms of sphere packing?\u00a0 Think of three unit radius balls packed tightly into a triangle with a fourth ball nested on the valley these three form, on either side of the triangle.\n\nThat makes a tetrahedron of balls with edges going from ball-center to ball-center.\u00a0 Each edge has length 2R (twice the radius of each ball) or D (the diameter of each ball).\n\nFigures:\n[http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86161.html](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f86161.html)\n[http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1105.html](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s04/figs/f1105.html)\n\nVector Addition:\n\nHow do we add two vectors in XYZ?\u00a0 Easy:\u00a0 we simply sum their respective (x,y,z) coordinates.\u00a0 If v0 = (x0,y0,z0) and v1 = (x1,y1,z1) then v0 + v1 = (x0+x1, y0+y1, z0+z1).\n\nConcrete example: (1,2,3) + (-1,-2,-3) = (0,0,0).\n\nNegating the first set of basis quadrays to get a second set, i.e. the remaining four corners of the 8-vertex cube, may be done with scalar multiplication, however the second set of quadrays defining the \"inverse tetrahedron\" (the dual of the first, same volume) does not need to introduce any negative numbers.\u00a0 \n\nThe first set was already sufficient to map (span, address) space, so our 4-tuples are free to remain entirely non-negative in their final (reduced, normalized, canonical) expression.\n\n- (1,0,0,0) = (-1,0,0,0) = (0,1,1,1)\u00a0 (i.e. 180 degree flipped)\ni.e. a vector pointing oppositely.\n\nThe four \"negative\" quadrays, pointing at 180 degree to the first four would then be: \n\n{(0,1,1,1),(1,0,1,1),(1,1,0,1),(1,1,1,0)}.\n\nThe two sets together define the eight vertexes of a cube.\n\nNote the four pairs of inverse vectors always sum to the identity vector e.\n\n(1,0,0,0) + (0,1,1,1) = (1,1,1,1) = (0,0,0,0) = e\n\n(0,1,0,0) + (1,0,1,1) = (1,1,1,1) = (0,0,0,0) = e\n\nand so on.\u00a0 XYZ is the same way:\u00a0 v + (-v) = e = (0,0,0).\n\nWe see that the operation of vector addition with quadrays involves a two step algorithm: \n\nStep 1: add corresponding elements in each 4-tuple, then\n\nStep 2: normalize to the canonical representation using an identity bringing the minimum element (which may be a negative number) to zero.\u00a0\n\nSubtracting two quadrays is syntactic sugar for adding the inverse i.e. q0 - q1 = q0 + (-q1).\u00a0 A negated quadray may always be expressed in canonical (non-negative element) form.\n\nExample:\n\n(1,1,2,0) - (3,1,1,0) = (1,1,2,0) + (-3, -1, -1, 0) = (-2, 0, 1, 0) = (-2, 0, 1, 0) + (2,2,2,2) = (0, 2, 3, 2)\n\nWe might also do it this way: (1,1,2,0) - (3,1,1,0) = (1,1,2,0) + (0, 2, 2, 3) = (1, 3, 4, 3) = (0, 2, 3, 2)\n\nNote that (1,3,4,3) is not canonical form either, as we still need to apply Step 2:\u00a0 subtract the minimum element from all four i.e. (1,3,4,3) - (1,1,1,1) = (0,2,3,2).\n\nWe're done when one or more elements is 0 and the others are non-negative.\n\nA secondary canonical form, used interimly in some algorithms, allows negative numbers but requires the four coordinates add to zero.\u00a0 (2,0,1,1) becomes (1,-1,0,0) by adding (-1, -1, -1, -1).\n\nAny (a, a, a, a) = (0, 0, 0, 0) = e because the four vectors (a,0,0,0) + (0,a,0,0) + (0,0,a,0) + (0,0,0,a) cancel one another out and sum to the origin.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\nXYZ is like this too: adding all six spokes of \"the jack\" nets to the zero sum vector i.e. e (identity element for vector addition).\n\nConclusions:\n\nWhat's been defined above so far is sufficient to provide:\n\n(i) a distance formula (length formula) for any quadray vector, such that |v| -> Number were v is a quadray (this is well developed in other writings, as well as in computer code).\n\n(ii) a conversion algorithm whereby any (x,y,z) coordinate may be expressed as a unique quadray in canonical form, and vice versa:\u00a0 every quadray may be expressed in (x,y,z) coordinates (also implemented).\n\nOne property of Quadrays that's interesting then, is they're isomorphic to XYZ. \n\nConsider that spherical coordinates (r, theta, alpha) are also a useful expression of all the same points\u00a0 addressed by (x,y,z).\u00a0 Isomorphism is a feature, not an unnecessary redundancy.\u00a0 Sometimes computing in an alternative representation is more convenient and/or generative of new insights.\n\nQuadray coordinates, like spherical coordinates, give another unique address for the same point in space. They could be introduced in conjunction with spherical coordinates as an alternative representation.\n\nAnother property of quadrays is their ability to sum, using only positive integer 4-tuples, to give the vertexes needed for a canonical set of concentric polyhedrons, starting with the basis tetrahedron of edges 2R and volume one.\n\nVolume one?\u00a0 That's not conventional in XYZ thinking either, but we have a logical foundation for using this alternative model, with [a triangular analog](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/03/ethnomath.html). The implications of this alternative logic are worth exploring.\n\nIf we adopt the unit-tet model then we likewise get whole number volumes for (volumes in parens):\n\n- the canonical quadray cube described above (3)\u00a0\n- its dual octahedron where edges cross (4)\u00a0\n- their combination as a rhombic dodecahedron (6)\u00a0and\u00a0\n- the 12-balls-around-1 cuboctahedron that characterizes any ball in the CCP lattice (20).\u00a0 \n\nFor example the corners of the latter cuboctahedron are simply the 12 points: \n\n{(2, 1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 1, 0), (2, 1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 1, 1), (2, 0, 1, 1),\n\u00a0(1, 2, 1, 0), (1, 2, 0, 1), (1, 1, 2, 0), (1, 1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 1, 2),\n\u00a0(1, 2, 1, 0), (1, 2, 0, 1), (1, 1, 2, 0), (1, 1, 0, 2), (1, 0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 1, 2),\n\u00a0(0, 2, 1, 1), (0, 2, 1, 1), (0, 1, 2, 1), (0, 1, 1, 2), (0, 1, 2, 1), (0, 1, 1, 2)}\n\ni.e. all combinations of {2,1,1,0}.\u00a0 \n\nRestricting quadray addition to a pool of only these, disallowing any scaling, gives the vertexes of the CPP (= FCC), the dense-packing (~74% ) of unit-radius balls, a \"home base\" in crystallography.\n\nAlso true, though not proved here:\u00a0 any tetrahedron defined by four CCP vertexes has a whole number volume relative to our canonical reference tetrahedron of volume one.\n\nFor further reading:\n[The Quadray Papers](http://mathforum.org/library/view/6236.html)\n[Posting to mathfuture](http://tinyurl.com/j2cslya) (April 25, 2016)\n\n[](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/03/ethnomath.html)",
