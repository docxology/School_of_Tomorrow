  "content": "My YouTube channel contains quite a few examples of me presenting this slide deck.\u00a0\n\nThis latest version dives into more technical detail on many of the slides.\u00a0\n\nMy treatment this time may have been influenced by a changing sense of my audience.  Since connecting with the Math 4 Wisdom (M4W) community, headed up by Andrius Kulikauskas, I've senses my audience having higher bandwidth -- as in \"intake capacity\" -- regarding the mathematics of what we're doing.\u00a0\n\nI was also inspired by some recent work on the S-module, in turn inspired by David Koski and Casey House. \n\nI'm continuing to see Synergetics as more a philosophical work in mathematical foundations, but with a built-in critique of \"foundations\" as a metaphor, given our conceptual space is more gravity-neutral than we experience as tiny guys on Planet Earth.\u00a0\n\nWe're more apt to see our system as a planet in and of itself i.e. infrastructure of a spherical nature cohered by gravity, and capable of functioning as a transceiver i.e. as both a tuned in recipient and a caster-emitter of intelligence and information.",
