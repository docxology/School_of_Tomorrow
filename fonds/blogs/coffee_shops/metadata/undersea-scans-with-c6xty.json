Would you like to accelerate along a learning curve?\n\nI'm looking to India and other ancient cultures for some feedback on this question, regarding the IVM as an archetype.\u00a0 What's[ the etymology of \"isotropic\"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/isotropic) in ancient Greek?\u00a0 Do we find the IVM in the Vedas in some precursor form?\u00a0 Some Buddhist have said it means Void (in translation).\u00a0 That sounds fine, but let's not wait for someone in California to figure it all out, OK?\u00a0 Oregon Curriculum Network has more direct sources.\n\nIVM has many meanings of course, as my PhD friend Dr. Potkin reminds me.\u00a0 Of course this being CSN, home of those synergetics hypertoons, I'm using the namespace of Dr. Fuller:\u00a0 isotropic vector matrix.\n\nThat's the CCP (or FCC) to you chem heads (Linus Pauling's preferred stomping ground).\u00a0 Check OCN's stash of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/Generating%20the%20FCC.ipynb) for more info ([School of Tomorrow](https://github.com/4dsolutions/School_of_Tomorrow) meme).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/48818514092/in/album-72157710244744097/)",
