  "content": "Aldous Huxley takes a speculative tone, thinking aloud about how we might maximize our potential.  He's not interested in physical breeding, so much as in creating learning environments optimized for human subjects. \"Increasing awareness\" is an ethical goal for Huxley, a matter of faith for him, and shared with Bucky Fuller.He recommends training the body however, especially its senses.\u00a0 I can see him advising students to take some mind enhancing substance and diving in to educational computer games.\u00a0 Have fun.\u00a0 Enjoy.",
