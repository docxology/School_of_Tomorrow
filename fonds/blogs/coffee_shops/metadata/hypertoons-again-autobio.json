  "content": "Hypertoon treatment would be ideal for communicating Synergetics, because of the partially overlapping scenarios configuration.\n\nA hypertoon is like a spaghetti ball of short cartoons (animations) terminating in switch points where smooth segues (transitions) may occur.\n\nSynergetics suggests lots of animated sequences, such as an octahedron turing into a \"boat\" and spiralling forward or backward (\"arcing\").\u00a0 Does this scenario serve any useful scientific purpose?\u00a0 As a Platonist, I'm just following the tetrahelix thread.\n\nAnother transformation is of course the Jitterbug, at the center of the Concentric Hierarchy as a unifying \"bow tie Universe\" pulsation device (one could say).\u00a0 Telling the story of the Jitterbug and its \"station stops\" is traversing a kind of backbone, from which many side stories branch out.\n\nIn more recent autobiographical videos I talk about a Pycon in Washington, DC where I was scheduled to talk more about hypertoons.  I actually did get to give such a talk, at a different Pycon in DC, if memory serves. Dawn joined me on that trip.  When was that?",
