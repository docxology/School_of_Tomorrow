  "content": "This is one of my favorite computer game genres, where you confront a city intersection and have to model muddling through in some way. \n\nIf you're a policeman, do you have the right to confiscate the property of the houseless person 30 feet from City Hall in the margin of a sidewalk, with no visible shelter? \n\nAs an old man, will your time run out before the street car lurches on without you, or will you run fast enough on your current dosage? \n\nIs there a drinking fountain? \u00a0Unusual, but maybe we're in Portland (look up: \u00a0Benson Bubblers). \u00a0Is there fluoride in that water? \u00a0From where exactly? \u00a0So much to study (it's an ecosystem after all).\n\nWas the intersection badly designed? \n\nSometimes it's just culture. \n\nIn Portland, more cyclists \"felt safe\" in this new green area, whereas the cars would not see them and turn right anyway, hitting them. \n\nThis was a spike in statistics after a new painting scheme was applied at, you guessed it, street intersections.",
