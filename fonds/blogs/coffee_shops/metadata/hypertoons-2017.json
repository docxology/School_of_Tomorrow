In that second volume, we got a more complete basis for working with the five-fold symmetric shapes already within the concentric hierarchy, namely the T, E and S modules.\n\nPicking up on that thread, we have since amplified the 120 T-module volume 5 rhombic triacontahedron, of radius just a tad under 1 (0.99948...), to another copy weighing in at 7.5 and sharing a set of tips with the rhombic dodecahedron (RD), of volume 6.\n\nThe 120 E-module volume 5+ RT, on the other hand, of radius precisely 1, scales up by \u03a6\u00a0(linearly) to give the\u00a015\u221a2 volumed RT, dubbed SuperRT, wherein the Jitterbug Icosahedron of edges 2R, embeds as long diagonals, with a volume of\u00a05\u221a2 \u03a62.\n\nThe ratio of said Jitterbug Icosahedron to its related larger-volumed cuboctahedron (CO) of equal edges is defined by what David Koski and I are calling the S-factor i.e. CO/Icosa = S/E = (2\u221a2)/\u03a62\u00a0 or (2\u221a2)\u03a6-2\u00a0or about 1.080363.\n\nStarting with any Icosahedron, one application of the S-factor nets the volume of the corresponding CO with same edge lengths, the \"Jitterbug\" relationship.\n\nTwo applications of 1/S-factor (the reciprocal), on the other hand, nets the volume of the corresponding CO with faces flush to the same containing octahedron, the \"skew\" relationship.\n\nIn other words, this smaller-volumed CO and Icosa are skew to one another with overlapping facial regions, as shown in [Synergetics 2, Figure 988.00](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f8800.html).\n\nFor example, the Icosahedron inscribed in the Octahedron of volume 4 has S-factor edges.\u00a0 Two applications of 1/S-factor gives the volume 2.5 CO with edges R, i.e. precisely 1/8th the volume of the 2R 20 volumed JT CO.\n\nCO2.5 * S-factor * S-factor gives the S-factor-edged Icosa inscribed in the volume 4 octa, from whence S-modules are derived.\n\nOne more application of the S-factor gives the CO shown below, nestled precisely within the RT5+ at the green points.\n\nIn contrast, the CO with \u221a2 edges, shown above is precisely 1/3rd the RT5+ volume.\n\nFinally, David realized another relationship:\u00a0 S3, the volumetric version of the Synergetics Constant, ordinarily used to take us from cubic units to tetrahedron units, is also the ratio of SuperRT to the Jitterbug CO. S3 = \u221a(9/8).\n\nPut another way, the RT with long diagonals equal to the Icosahedron from which a CO is developed by Jitterbugging, has a volume S3 times that CO's volume.\u00a0 20 * S3 = 15\u221a2.\n\nWe may also introduce the T-factor as the ratio between the RT5+ and RT5, i.e. the E-modules and T-modules rhombic triacontahedrons.\u00a0 That number is (3\u221a2)/\u03a63\u00a0or (3\u221a2)\u03a6-3. The reciprocal of its 3rd root is the linear scale factor\u00a00.99948... (mentioned above) taking us from the E-mods RT to the T-mods RT.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/37516435114/in/dateposted-public/)",
