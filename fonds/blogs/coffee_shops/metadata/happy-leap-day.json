  "content": "I'm somewhat surprised how little is made of Leap Day.\u00a0 Why isn't it a big festival day, every four years (caveats apply)?\n\nI'm booked in to US Pycon this month, coming a little late but in time for the main keynotes.\u00a0 I've been learning a lot about charitable giving and Internet infrastructure as a member of the PSF (Python Software Foundation).\n\nCSN is about providing infrastructure similar to video poker run by the Oregon State, except the player is expecting to donate winnings, normally considered losings, to worthy programs.\u00a0 Winnings for self may be a part of some games as well, as may one be a recipient of others' directed winnings, perhaps ear-marked for some purpose.\u00a0\n\nYes, the rules could get complex, but then it's a game we're already playing, simply formalized with new infrastructure and software (and games).\n\nIn the physics namespace, it's about energy transformation, information theory, and value added.\u00a0 You have the energy that drives your day, and the work that you do with that energy.\u00a0\n\nThese concepts trace back to early GST writings in personal workspace 284 (like a time-share) in the early 1980s -- is how it worked out in my case.\u00a0\n\nGiven the Noosphere, it'll have come to others in other ways. \n\nSome of these concepts matured into First Person Physics, which got the attention of Dr. Bob Fuller, a man of much experience, including in Burma.\u00a0 I follow his progress on CareCalendar these days, following a serious medical event.\n\nI'm booked into Philadelphia tomorrow.\u00a0 I don't know how that will go, but I do expect to make some valuable headway.\u00a0 Watching the AFSC do its business, contributing here and there, is another way I observe philanthropy in action.\n\nI've had recent visits will all my officers except Jody.\u00a0 The financials aren't that complicated yet, when it comes to real properties on the ground.\u00a0 Cyberia doesn't require much of a footprint, when it comes to testing ideas.\u00a0 More servers in the cloud are but a finger snap away.\n\nI have a new bio on-line.",
