Portland Cable TV, bless its little heart, broadcast the whole\nseries and one of my neighbors ordered the DVD, which is why I got to\nrewatch some of it today on break:\u00a0\n\n[http://www.dimensions-math.org/Dim_E.htm](http://www.dimensions-math.org/Dim_E.htm)\n\nToday on break I'm watching this video by my friend D. Koski, with whom\nI've collaborated a lot over the years, including on an in-person\npilgrimage / visit to Magnus Wenninger, a grand-daddy of polyhedrons in our\nage.\n\nDave's stuff is solidly three dimensional yet still comes off as somewhat\nalien given he has adopted the Fuller School's unit of mensuration, the\ntetrahedron, and here compares the volume of an enneacontahedron inscribed\nin a rhombic triacontahedron (\"NCLB Polyhedron\") in turn compared with a\nsphere.\n\nBut his sphere's volume is (sqrt 2)(pi) instead of (4/3)(pi) for\nradius = 1. That's owing to our different interpretation of L^3 i.e. 3rd\npowering is a tetrahedron for us, when represented geometrically. You'll\nremember I've talked about \"our branch\" in the tree of living mathematics.\n\nAlso: getting into David's stuff more deeply requires making room for yet\nanother meaning of '4D'.\n\nLet me explain...\n\nThe Dimensions TV show cited above (it aired on Portland Cable Television)\nis what I might call Coxeter.4D in flavor, where I use a proper name as a\n\"namespace\" and use \"dot notation\" to show '4D' \"belongs to\" that\nnamespace (GSC take note).\n\nHowever, in some of the movie's narrative, we seem to bleed over into\nEinstein.4D wherein \"time is the fourth dimension\" with x, y, z for three\n\"spatial\" dimensions.\n\nCoxeter himself is at pains to distinguish between\nthese two meanings of 4D in his Regular Polytopes i.e. \"the tesseract\"\nand \"the time machine\" are two different animals, much as science fiction\nwriters might want to conflate them in the popular imagination as a way to\ndrive their plots.\n\nThese are two of the great schools of thought that survived the early 1900s\n\"shake out\" re 4D as a meme. Linda Dalrymple Henderson has written [a finebook on this topic](http://www.amazon.com/Fourth-Dimension-Non-Euclidean-Geometry-Leonardo/dp/0262582449/).\n\nDavid's stuff comes from a third school (which Dr. Henderson also traces),\nless well known, that associates '4D' with the \"four directions\" of the\nregular tetrahedron, i.e. four points and four faces, carving space into\nfour quadrants instead of the eight octants of the XYZ / Cartesian\napparatus.\n\nLets call that Fuller.4D.\n\nSo we have three meanings of 4D to stay aware of, each anchored in a\ndifferent namespace:\n\nCoxeter.4D \npolytope R^N geometry as in Regular Polytopes and\nn-dimensional sphere packing ala Conway\n\nEinstein.4D \nMinkowski space, Relativity, three spatial dimensions, one\nof time\n\nFuller.4D \nfour directional tetrahedron as volume unit and model of 3rd\npowering\n\nMore reading on this topic of namespaces in mathematics:\n\n[http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/more-dimension-talk.html](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/more-dimension-talk.html)\n[http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/dimension-talk.html](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/dimension-talk.html)\n[http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/practicing-multiculturalism.html](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/practicing-multiculturalism.html)\n\nOK, back to work.\n\nKirby\n\n===\n\nFor further reading:\n[Has GST been applied effectively to promulgate Fuller's work? ](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9580986)\n[Action plans to spread the word about Synergetics (retrospective)\u00a0](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9581622)\n[Various flavors of GST...](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9582650)",
