  "content": "I came across this Youtube recently, which some of\nyou may already know about.  I've linked straight to\nwhere Bucky Fuller was mentioned, as he was given\na copy of The Animate and the Inanimate to review,\na little known work by one William James Sidis.\n\nWilliam and Bucky were both Harvard men, and the\n18 year old Fuller had actually been aware of Siddis,\nwho'd been admitted some years earlier at the tender\nage of 11.  You'll  find that story on page 42 in Alec's\nbook.\n\nAlec credits the Siddis lectures to Harvard's Mathematical\nClub for getting Fuller going on his own \"4D\" arc and\nworldline (i.e. meme).  Indeed, when Fuller reads the\nSiddis manuscript, he sees the approximate face of\nSynergetics (just going to press at that time).\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zNYK7rnXi9g?t=960\n\nTibees, the Youtuber, is a serious intellectual scholar,\ntaking the time and trouble to unearth and read the\nearly writings of the later famous.  I watched her review\nof Neil deGrasse Tyson's PhD thesis this morning as well.\u00a0\n\n[originally posted to TrimTab Book Club, a listserv moderated by Curt McNamara]",
