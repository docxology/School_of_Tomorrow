I'm referring to a \"gambling for charity\" model akin to church bingo or state lottery except the beneficiary is picked from a list supported by the house, a cause or charity. The player has nothing to lose and gains by keeping a public profile (= reputation). You'll see models approximating this one out there already. I brand around a specific decor (a look and feel). Anyway, it's all out there. Thanks for asking.\n\nKirby Urner[4dsolutions.net](http://4dsolutions.net/)\nOregon Curriculum Network (OCN)\nCoffee Shops Network (CSN)",
