  "content": "I find it both anomalous and fitting that my \"math is an outdoor sport\" scouting meme, and my Coffee Shops Network meme, are floating together.\n\nThe scouting meme connects to the more discipline experience of life on base, training, a boot camp, with the coffee shop a place to relax and unwind, off base, a [safe retreat](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2014/03/gi-coffeeshops-tour-2014.html).\n\nThe two institutions balance one another.\u00a0 Student union.\u00a0 Back stage (off script).\n\nThe reveries on the LCDs help with studying, with some reveries doubling as thinly veiled PR for whatever superstar course.\u00a0 Come to space camp or whatever.\u00a0 Remember we have winner philanthropists in the room.\u00a0 Even if they don't sign up themselves, they might sponsor.\n\nIf you're looking for opportunities, just watching these screens will give you ideas sometimes.\n\nHowever there's no need to be too impulsive.\n\nA good boot camp is surrounded with a gradient, different levels of commitment.\u00a0 Help students feel their way forward.\u00a0 Road maps:\u00a0 also a good idea.\u00a0 Take the Introduction to Programming course, find out which \"full stack\" or \"tool chain\" might best fit your dreams.\n\nI'm using \"code school\" and \"boot camp\" almost interchangeably, but then injecting more from the cooking and camping arenas, more farming.\u00a0 The Internet of Things does not always mean tiny things.\n\nCooking in an industrial kitchen teaches about concurrency (kept promises trigger what to do next), as does theater whereas coding for exceptions handles promises not kept.\u00a0 Things happen.\n\nAs I was mentioning on mathfuture earlier this morning, we want a Tractor class in part because we may be using a real tractor later that same day, or in a next work/study stint.\n\nSoftware engineering, sensors, tracking inventory, weighing costs (trade-offs):\u00a0 this is systems analysis and agile, all rolled into one.",
