  "content": "You might be wondering about the embedded YouTube, assuming it's still there (assuming too much?), which is about using a Python computer language framework named Flask as a front end to some back end defined by its API.\u00a0 This would model a Food Cart in a Pod (or out by its lonesome).\u00a0 Flask shows the menu and talks to a back end to complete the transaction.\u00a0 Crypto-currencies might be involved (that was the thinking anyway).\n\nThis architecture was somewhat my focus as __CMO__ (chief marketing officer) as I tried to wrap my head around how front and back ends got along, in a language in which I was fluent (Python, and to some extent Flask).\n\nCSN (Coffee Shops Network), some of you will recall, is a Philosophy wrapping a Business Model that involves building your profile as both a player risk taker and charitable giver, a philanthropist.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCoffee Shops are a science fictional cross between an arcade game parlor and a coffee shop.\u00a0 My locale had both Avalon and Quarter World within walking distance (for reference), and lots of coffee shops.\u00a0 To say they're science fictional doesn't mean you can't create them for real, just that the imaginary component stays relevant, going forward.\n\nA Coffee Shop is expected to serve various goodies along with the beverages, as we've all (\"all\") experienced at a StarBucks by now (not that this chain invented the combo -- Dunkin Donuts is a parallel implementation of the vision).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nPortland features many coffee shop bakery combos, with fresh made from scratch baked goods to accompany professionally brewed blends.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nExtrapolating along those lines, we get the more \"science fictiony\" versions (more speculative), encompassing the idea of \"study drugs\" or whatever local universities experiment with.\u00a0 The hypertoons with optionally tunable soundtracks, review a lot of topics in high bandwidth, including medical stuff.\u00a0 Not every \"study hall\" is themed the same way.\n\nThe focus might be the games themselves, or the meta-game of having the games net usable income streams for actual players in the field.\u00a0 This isn't all funny money.\u00a0 Work gets done.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSupportive players that direct funds through arcades may later (or before) have a role at the other end, so to speak, e.g. where the orangutans are getting protected.",
