  "content": "I was up early making this YouTube.\u00a0\n\nI'll blame Sydney, my dog.  But then I wanted to get some kind of YouTube out.\u00a0 So Sydney was more my excuse.\u00a0 I like being productive in the early pre-light hours.\n\nThen I pushed myself to walk to the top of Mt. Tabor and back, starting before 6 am.\u00a0 As I was up until maybe 2 or 3 am listening to Ram Dass, I was operating on next to no sleep and found I was battling brain fog, even after drinking a lot of coffee and doing this somewhat off the cuff (impromptu) YouTube.\n\nBy the time I started down, the cold air and continued exertion level had put my brain back in gear.\u00a0 I'd forgotten my iPhone and my Apple Watch ran out of change before my return.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nActually finding said iPhone required quite a bit of movement as well.\u00a0 Matters improved when I realized said phone still had charge and I'd be able to make it ring using the watch, once it was charged a little.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe iPhone was under the living room futon, the kind of place it'd take forever to find were it not able to make noise.\n\nI'm chatting a lot about my devices because they're a big part of my up close reality these days, along with my pets.\u00a0 I also took a Lumix camera up Mt. Tabor.\u00a0 I have two such cameras since that night I fell and thought I'd lost one of them and so purchased another (used).\u00a0 That was in 2022.\u00a0 I still feel that knee injury sometimes.",
