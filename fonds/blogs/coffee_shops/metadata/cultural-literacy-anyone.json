  "content": "I understand how math teachers get defensive, about how their curriculum is already packed with topics.  Bringing back hexadecimals is bad enough, but introducing a whole different approach to the polyhedra... that's not what they signed up for.\n\nI keep reassuring them:\u00a0 don't you worry, this is for humanities people to understand.
