  "content": "The 52 Living Ideas\u00a0channel, anchored by Shrikant, is NYC-based.\u00a0 In the video, I link it to Philadelphia, which it is through CJ, one of the Philadelphians co-appearing with Shrikant on overlapping channels.Quoting CJ:\u00a0Shrikant operates out of New York City. I've only met him via telephone and video conference.\nHis 52 Living Ideas group has world around participation. During COVID, there is no local: it's a global pandemic: we're all in it together.",
