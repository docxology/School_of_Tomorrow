&lt;br /&gt;
If you&#39;re a policeman, do you have the right to confiscate the property of the houseless person 30 feet from City Hall in the margin of a sidewalk, with no visible shelter? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As an old man, will your time run out before the street car lurches on without you, or will you run fast enough on your current dosage? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is there a drinking fountain? &amp;nbsp;Unusual, but maybe we&#39;re in Portland (look up: &amp;nbsp;Benson Bubblers). &amp;nbsp;Is there fluoride in that water? &amp;nbsp;From where exactly? &amp;nbsp;So much to study (it&#39;s an ecosystem after all).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Was the intersection badly designed? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes it&#39;s just culture. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Portland, more cyclists &quot;felt safe&quot; in this new green area, whereas the cars would not see them and turn right anyway, hitting them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was a spike in statistics after a new painting scheme was applied at, you guessed it, street intersections.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/feeds/5993052838548328867/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2013/09/street-intersection-game.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/5993052838548328867'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/5993052838548328867'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2013/09/street-intersection-game.html' title='Street Intersection: The Game'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-2972380140131195368</id><published>2013-05-02T14:50:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-02T14:50:58.404-07:00</updated><title type='text'>May Day Festivities</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Good paradigm non-profit.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m in the role of &lt;a href=&quot;http://afsc.org/resource/afsc-meetingchurch-liaison-program&quot;&gt;go-between&lt;/a&gt; twixt AFSC and one of the Yearly Meetings:&amp;nbsp; North Pacific Yearly Meeting.&lt;br /&gt;

Quakers sometimes come across as puritanical, as if against gambling and drinking for example.&amp;nbsp; My brand of Friend is not like that.&amp;nbsp; Jesus was OK with alcohol and parties.&amp;nbsp; Life is gambling, taking risks, acting on educated guesses (hypotheses).&amp;nbsp; Philanthropists strategically channel funds to what appear to be successful projects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here, we play games in order to build our own skills in various ways, and gaining in proficiency is by definition rewarding.&amp;nbsp; The greater your winnings, the more of a hero you are for your causes, the more you express your will through a specific infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even outside said infrastructure, life is the same way:&amp;nbsp; you and I have our daily bread, incoming time/energy, our allotted space and time, and we have our value-adding gaming, our livelihoods, our actions, whereby we learn (gain experience) in an instructive, feed-back rich environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You and I express our wills in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The AFSC website is paradigmatic of a front end or brochure style access point, with the facilities to dig deeper.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/feeds/2959788804059784501/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2013/01/daily-play.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/2959788804059784501'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/2959788804059784501'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2013/01/daily-play.html' title='Daily Play'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-6449709294360516325</id><published>2012-11-11T14:11:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-11T14:23:41.455-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Worthy Cause</title><content type='html'>Pictures from STEM Expo, San Antonio, TX.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Civic participation was galvanized by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/11/goscon-2010.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;i&gt;Ignite&lt;/i&gt; event format&lt;/a&gt;, which featured pre-screened five minute talks by an interesting cross-section of willing presenter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our line up tonight included people giving advice based on hard won experience regarding mountain climbing, designing voting systems, spying electronically, mothering, computer game playing, naked bike riding and Muppets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the talks expanded historical horizons by reaching back through time, while others expanded our sense of today&#39;s geography.&amp;nbsp; Antarctica was a feature this evening.&amp;nbsp; One of the first talks was by a dad who has been collecting data about a toddler, exploring her new world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An engineer spoke on the innards of slot machines, which I thought was pretty interesting.&amp;nbsp; He reaffirmed what I often say, that the gambling industry has every incentive to keep the games based purely in the mathematics of chance.&amp;nbsp; Theoreticians have developed criteria to prevent control beyond what the laws themselves would dictate, but this doesn&#39;t prevent designers from make the games as alluring as possible.&amp;nbsp; A near win (i.e. a loss) is more motivating than an actual win in some ways, so the games do have ways to make the loss look like an &quot;almost win&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Muppetologist referred to Muppets from after my time, which proved my advanced age to myself.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d watched Sesame Street in high school a lot, in the Philippines, but Sam the Eagle, Gonzo and Animal had not yet joined the cast.&amp;nbsp; I knew who Elmo was, and Kermit of course...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An organizer for Portland&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Naked Bike Ride&lt;/i&gt; went over some of the history and safety tips in a humorous fashion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The voting / election infrastructure expert emphasized that free and fair elections alone do not a democracy make.&amp;nbsp; High levels of civic participation remains key.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The talk about coding slot machines connected to the voting machines in that the former are subject to more scrutiny than the latter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/gkv8mvzjttQ&quot;&gt;The Brony talk&lt;/a&gt; opened some insights into the Django world, although the thinking there is &quot;pony&quot; stands for &quot;feature request&quot; and &quot;not getting one&quot; is reflective of Django&#39;s conservative, not-promising-the-moon culture.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s another joke about half-empty versus half-full, with the optimist saying &quot;there&#39;s gotta be a pony in here some place&quot;.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a nice way of saying you&#39;ve been digging through a steaming pile of something obnoxious and remain hopeful that there will be some sort of payoff down the road.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ben, with our company, was a chief organizer, though through &lt;i&gt;Stumptown Syndicate&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I attended with our out of town school principal, a mentor in chief.&amp;nbsp; We call ourselves &quot;graders&quot; in that we have some control over steepness (&quot;grade&quot;) and calculus is all about the gradient at each point (our school teachers calculus, though that&#39;s not what I do for them).&amp;nbsp; And speaking of grades, cousin Lee sent out a picture of a grader tonight, a type of road equipment I&#39;ve always found somewhat fascinating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Collagen:&amp;nbsp; a family of proteins, more or less tightly wound, making bone, ligament, skin.&amp;nbsp; A triple helix hey?&amp;nbsp; I made &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/70500&quot;&gt;a note of that&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Synergeo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets not forget &lt;a href=&quot;http://flac.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;FLAC&lt;/a&gt;, the new lossless codec.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last but not least, I want to mention the talk about living in one&#39;s RV in an urban area, as a lifestyles.&amp;nbsp; The seeds of the bizmo idea were being planted, as this guy indeed runs his web site design business out of his remodeled &lt;i&gt;Rialta&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; He has designed a handsome interior.&amp;nbsp; He made a good case that &quot;minification&quot; i.e. &quot;more with less&quot; is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An important point:&amp;nbsp; he doesn&#39;t drive it that much (yes, it needs short trips to the RV dumping ground to empty sewage).&amp;nbsp; An average bizmo may relocate more often than a mobile home (unmotorized) but may stay put for weeks or months at a time.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re Dave Ulmer, you pull a trailer with motorcycle and snowmobile for your radius around a base camp.&amp;nbsp; In Portland, a bicycle + rain gear would serve that purpose.&amp;nbsp; Upshot:&amp;nbsp; larger numbers of people working from bizmo bases does not necessarily translate into greater per capita fuel consumption.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I salute the bizmo lifestyle evangelist for tackling the issue of stereotypes head on.&amp;nbsp; He didn&#39;t mention &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/i&gt;, a fictional made-for-TV series in which a bizmo stars from the opening scene (a mobile biological weapons lab, one might call it, in that it&#39;s used to make neurotoxins) but he did address a cultural tendency to associate wandering RVs with &quot;hippie badsters&quot; of some kind.&amp;nbsp; And yet our speaker was not of that breed.&amp;nbsp; Nothing scuzzy or untoward.&amp;nbsp; One could almost see the lights going on in peoples&#39; heads.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s why it&#39;s called &lt;i&gt;Ignite&lt;/i&gt;, although some make a connection to &lt;i&gt;Burning Man&lt;/i&gt; as well.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/9222777241501256714'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/9222777241501256714'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2012/09/ignite-portland-11.html' title='Ignite Portland 11'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-7553200139870167708</id><published>2012-08-26T21:24:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-26T21:25:04.915-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Fluid Dynamics</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve presented the basics of Coffeeshops Casinos or whatever we call them, a few times at Wanderers, which meets in a boyhood home of the Nobel Prize winning Linus Pauling (February 28, 1901 – August 19, 1994)).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David has written a book on concurrency to help people think about the challenges of programming many processes to run in parallel, an exercise often undertaken, in life outside electronic computing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My top people in this organization are people I consider top ranking. &amp;nbsp;They represent characteristics I would want in chiefs of some company, staff or tribe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our topics were free ranging as usual. &amp;nbsp;Jon Bunce brought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/7841709734/in/photostream&quot;&gt;one of his comical drawings&lt;/a&gt; from the 1980s. &amp;nbsp;I thought it was excellent. &amp;nbsp;Glenn had three books he&#39;s recently purchased.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s only partial overlap twixt Wanderers and those whom I describe as my chiefs, with me chief marketing officer or CMO.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CEO is entirely fictional and/or mythical, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/10/subgenius-devival.html&quot;&gt;like a deity&lt;/a&gt;, so of course that means we cannot be a &quot;white man LLC&quot; i.e. a post Civil War corporation with personhood. &amp;nbsp;The CEO is manifestly a white man though, by the name of Dobbs, smokes a pipe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You could call this a placeholder business or emulator (similar to incubator). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might spin out a business based on the open source templates presented here. &amp;nbsp;Others might do the same, but differently.&lt;br /&gt;

These &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/06/at-toms.html&quot;&gt;Mandelbulb fly throughs&lt;/a&gt; have been important to me as I contemplate the relationship between CSN bars and the flipped classrooms of adulthood, with the childhood corollaries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You want a safe enough space to immerse yourself in arcana if need be, because in obscure Chinese herbs you may find a cure, or so goes the promise of the archetypal apocathery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/cDd8R0xlkNA&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The remedy may as well be metaphysical, and the right studies (and/or left), with aesthetics, will have power to spin you out of a slump, just as other metaphysics may have helped get you into one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So stay on your guard, or develop one if you have none.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the earlier 21st century we have the paradox of people attempting to drive places in ways that not only squander fuel, but pose significant risk to their personal and financial health.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They pack the freeways in blizzards.&amp;nbsp; Is this an intelligent species?&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s strong evidence to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a subset of this mad need for travel, people who make a major commitment to paying off a home cannot then afford to enjoy them without leaving them empty half the time, as partners commute and children board a bus to some loud and competitive place wherein viewing Mandelbulb videos is probably not a big pass time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fractals aren&#39;t much mentioned, despite the spike in interest awhile back.&amp;nbsp; We need to study those spikes more.&amp;nbsp; Intellectual history is a glue, and not just for the over-specialized.&amp;nbsp; STEM needs a bigger slice of the news, more air time in the media.&amp;nbsp; Lets work on that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/GkI0Gr-5y-U&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Le Hypertoon&lt;/i&gt; is classically conceived of as an animation consisting of segues twixt a set of key frames.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not like you, as a viewer, necessarily know which frames are key, however over time this may become more clear, as some of the vistas are definitely deja vu.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the design, key frames my show up less than once a minute (one can imagine really long loops) or many times a second, though that&#39;s reaching a threshold for even short attention spans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the rarified world of pure geometry hypertoons, which may act as a kernel, anchoring a broader sampling of STEM topics, we have the concentric hierarchy hypertoon, somewhat signature within CSN as a part of its decor, blends well with a McMenamins style, an influence on your first CMO (moi).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine tetrahedrons, variously sized, and spinning.&amp;nbsp; They glom together in certain ways.&amp;nbsp; Turns out they have interesting capabilities, to assemble one another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbDKiOCcfBY&quot;&gt;Koski&#39;s U, V and W&lt;/a&gt; all build one another using phi-scaled versions of themselves.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; They make a spiral.&amp;nbsp; They make the fat and thin hexahedrons of quasi-crystalline fame.&amp;nbsp; The U may be considered 2 K modules in volume where 1 K = 1 T module scaled by 1.5 i.e. K + K = T + T + T = A + A + B = &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/06/aristotle-was-right.html&quot;&gt;1 Mite in volume&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A self-referential pool like this will take you to high speed geometric hypertoons at various singularities.&amp;nbsp; Then the show will slow down again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A nice jungle scene with parrots, some foreground discussion of the ecosystem&#39;s feedback loops, with cutaways to animations.&amp;nbsp; Humans have done a lot of homework here, but without doing permanent damage.&amp;nbsp; We feel happier every time that happens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that there&#39;s nothing to say a hypertoon can&#39;t use live action, in the sense of adding physics rules. Classic hypertoons are based in pure geometry because the makes the key frame connections reversible whereas documentary footage tends to run best one way (not always).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Python prototypes compute their frames on the fly allowing for real time interactivity, with the user spinning and zooming as the action unfolds.&amp;nbsp; Higher resolution hypertoons or &quot;reveries&quot; might be pre-rendered and streamed by a kind of player / reader that doesn&#39;t need to recompute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hybrids use a combination, say a computed foreground against a pre-rendered background.&amp;nbsp; This gets us into game territory pretty quickly. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back to Koski modeles, some equations from the Poly list, in lightly edited form:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I use this method for differentiation of the various sizes of phi-scaled tetrahedron:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
. . . U6, U3, &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;, u3, u6 . . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
since volume changes by phi to the 3rd, 6th, 9th power when linearly scaling by up phi.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot; style=&quot;font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;U3 &amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt;=&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;) &amp;gt; u3 and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The U,V, W tetrahedra are composed of these amounts of lessor sized U, V, W:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;U&lt;/span&gt; = (2)w3 + (5)u6 + (4)v6 + (2)w6&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;V&lt;/span&gt; = (2)v3 + (3)u3 + (1)w3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; = (2)w3 + (3)v3 + (1)u3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Fat rhombohedron&amp;nbsp; = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;(18)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; + (6)u3 + (6)v3 + (6)w3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Thin rhombohedron = &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;(6)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;W&lt;/span&gt; + (12)u3 + (6)v3 + (6)w3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
In my town, people are out with clip boards seeking signatures, hoping to get Oregon law amended to where a casino might open where the old dog track used to be.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #eeeeee; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;In the meantime, Oregon&#39;s education system is starting to go down the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #eeeeee; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;tubes in its present format. Liberal moms are out picketing in favor&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #eeeeee; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;of a casino where the dog track used to be, things have gotten so bad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #eeeeee; font-family: tahoma, arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;&quot;&gt;Are they on strike in Gresham already? [ &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7794860&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The argument is the jobs and tax revenue it generates will go to serve the local area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most these clip boarders won&#39;t have a lot of time for my stump speech or marketing rap. &amp;nbsp;There&#39;s no setting up for PowerPoint on the street corner (not easily). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, they all know what Oregon Lottery is, and know that if all the people using it could make the money follow their preferences (what&#39;s know as &quot;exerting one&#39;s will&quot;), then the school system might be in less trouble. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If players could earmark their contributions down to the school... &amp;nbsp;what a concept. &amp;nbsp;On the ground, we&#39;d need real statistics. &amp;nbsp;A political gold mine. &amp;nbsp;Good thing we&#39;re friends with DemocracyLab (here in Portland -- FNB too).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s the short blurb of what CSN seeks to provide a community, a circuitry, an infrastructure, for channeling funds voluntarily, on a philanthropic basis, with a pump primed by local merchants and their sponsorships. &amp;nbsp;Religious institutions, NGOs, are more often recipients than sponsors, though charities do support other charities in this world, no question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Customers get a slice of company net profits, as if shareholders for a day (as consumers, why not?) and when they win big, they get to give big (commensurately, might not be that much in absolute terms -- but even pennies add up big time).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/csn-circuits.html&quot;&gt;Church bingo&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is the shortest tag line, but assumes a fair amount of background. &amp;nbsp;Catholics get it faster.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, it&#39;s pretty clear that the spread of this business plan represents friction in the everyday casino industry. &amp;nbsp;Indian Gaming takes a new turn and yada yada.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/6673397929103747903'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/6673397929103747903'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2012/04/local-politics.html' title='Local Politics'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-703012442249441669</id><published>2012-03-19T12:17:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2012-04-20T20:22:08.396-07:00</updated><title type='text'>More Geometric Reveries</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m booked in to US Pycon this month, coming a little late but in time for the main keynotes.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been learning a lot about charitable giving and Internet infrastructure as a member of the PSF (Python Software Foundation).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CSN is about providing infrastructure similar to video poker run by the Oregon State, except the player is expecting to donate winnings, normally considered losings, to worthy programs.&amp;nbsp; Winnings for self may be a part of some games as well, as may one be a recipient of others&#39; directed winnings, perhaps ear-marked for some purpose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, the rules could get complex, but then it&#39;s a game we&#39;re already playing, simply formalized with new infrastructure and software (and games).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the physics namespace, it&#39;s about energy transformation, information theory, and value added.&amp;nbsp; You have the energy that drives your day, and the work that you do with that energy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These concepts trace back to early GST writings in personal workspace 284 (like a time-share) in the early 1980s -- is how it worked out in my case.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the Noosphere, it&#39;ll have come to others in other ways. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of these concepts matured into First Person Physics, which got the attention of Dr. Bob Fuller, a man of much experience, including in Burma.&amp;nbsp; I follow his progress on CareCalendar these days, following a serious medical event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m booked into Philadelphia tomorrow.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t know how that will go, but I do expect to make some valuable headway.&amp;nbsp; Watching the AFSC do its business, contributing here and there, is another way I observe philanthropy in action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve had recent visits will all my officers except Jody.&amp;nbsp; The financials aren&#39;t that complicated yet, when it comes to real properties on the ground.&amp;nbsp; Cyberia doesn&#39;t require much of a footprint, when it comes to testing ideas.&amp;nbsp; More servers in the cloud are but a finger snap away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a new bio on-line.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/feeds/8336942938332750458/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2012/02/happy-leap-day.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/8336942938332750458'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/8336942938332750458'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2012/02/happy-leap-day.html' title='Happy Leap Day'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-5817378184258221802</id><published>2012-02-24T08:12:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-04-20T20:22:30.362-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Lighting Check</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Why not just give them the money directly?&quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Despite the economy of abundance we sketch as a backdrop, with the sun giving enough, in principle, to finance our surf, there&#39;s still the matter of triage and opportunity cost.  The cost of whatever I&#39;m doing now is whatever I&#39;m not doing -- a tautology, and therefore more properly the business of philosophy than economics, but we can discuss that some other time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Remember:  the games tend to be didactic, in the sense of encouraging thought, though not necessarily about the worthy cause at the receiving end (someone in need of dialysis?), your wins redound to your benefit on your karma profile, nor need this funnel / tube be considered, ever, a sole means of garnering support. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; Reach beyond CSN, by all means. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And finally:  yes, there&#39;s a kind of Darwinian process in that some games won&#39;t attract loyal players and/or players with skill, and nor will the causes connected to them.  This may be for a host of reasons. It&#39;s not my job to predict every corner case that might arise.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Remember: some people are philosophically opposed, on principle, to this or that.  A chief benefit of playing it forward is getting to designate, even if only in the sense of &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/01/storyboarding-lcds.html&quot;&gt;a ballpark&lt;/a&gt;.  If you don&#39;t want such-and-such a &quot;charity&quot; to be piggy-backing, taking advantage of your talents and skills, then here&#39;s a way to dodge those tentacles, to be free of those shackles.  Drop charities.  Turn your back.  Adopt others.  You have a lot of choice in the matter.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;CSN puts you in the driver&#39;s seat.  Manage your own karma profile.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Speaking of tautologies, it&#39;s easy to map this model to life itself.  You&#39;re playing world game 24/7 and your playing has ripple effects that may benefit various projects and initiatives to some degree.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Others may study your profile to figure out what you&#39;re up to.  Some may learn from your role modeling -- another way to have ripple effects.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Others may work to counter your biases, for example by attending to causes you seem to have no patience for, or which seem to rank low on your totem pole.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You might be a member of a team wherein the players have their individual biases yet, overall, the whole is greater than the some of its parts and lots of bases get covered.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nirel looked like Mary Poppins &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/reality-based-economics.html&quot;&gt;tonight&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/6494307021837617253'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/6494307021837617253'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/11/play-it-forward.html' title='Playing It Forward'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-8417804251897728075</id><published>2011-11-18T09:52:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2011-11-18T12:01:38.150-08:00</updated><title type='text'>More Market Research</title><content type='html'>I don&#39;t usually review &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/intuition-and-science.html&quot;&gt;ISEPP talks&lt;/a&gt; in this blog, but Gabe Zichermann&#39;s talk was too apropos to CSN work to log elsewhere.  Tara and I parked quite a view blocks away in a downpour, plus I&#39;d forgotten my raincoat so showed up wet in my dark suit coat and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-on-t-shirts.html&quot;&gt;bright orange T&lt;/a&gt; (with a collar -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/05/princeton-25th-reunion.html&quot;&gt;a reunion relic&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe is quite hip in the pre-hipster sense of &quot;tuned in&quot; (also pre-hippie), and carried his audience pretty effortlessly through his presentation.  Folks had no trouble following.  He included a long excerpt from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Storage Wars&lt;/span&gt;, a televised game based on the auctioning and purchase of storage units.  In this case, I&#39;d say the game serves a legitimizing function in that people empathize with the back end vulture culture that preys on lapsed units.  Reminds me of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/span&gt; in some ways, another deftly edited TV series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the dinner, I wanted to run by &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-source.html&quot;&gt;our business model&lt;/a&gt;:  vendor profits &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/proprietary-games.html&quot;&gt;prime the pump&lt;/a&gt;, with contributions to player-selected targets commensurate with performance (heroics rewarded), self profiling (&quot;what type of philanthropist am I?&quot;).  He encouraged us to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6359241897/in/photostream&quot;&gt;use Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose and I will do so later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6359244505/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;Tara&lt;/a&gt; asked about military applications and whether gamification could lead to the breeding of an especially cowardly subspecies of drone nazi, a kind of subhuman (paraphrase).  Gabe acknowledged that militaries had been using gamification for dark purposes since forever and yes, he shares her concerns.  Tara has grown up around Quakers and is interviewing for Earlham College tomorrow, so you can see where &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/investments.html&quot;&gt;our household&lt;/a&gt; might not be especially enamored of keeping a devolved idiocracy in a controlling capacity where outward weapons are concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gabe cracked an Occupy joke or two, knowing &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/virtual-opdx.html&quot;&gt;Portland was friendly&lt;/a&gt; to this global blowback operation.  He also knew we&#39;re too elitist about coffee to think of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/span&gt; as inner circle.  Having studied this market, I welcome the influx of coffee drinkers &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/memo-from-richmond.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides, plus I&#39;m not against &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/targeting-2012.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Starbucks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; adopting a few game kiosks, with our without the CSN imprimatur (just remember, you saw it here first).  We could use some of that muscle to get past &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/08/sounding-off.html&quot;&gt;Oregon Lottery zealots&lt;/a&gt; who cannot abide the competition.  That would take some of the pressure off the reservations to host all the parking (plus some of our best game studios can only be reached by bicycle, or electric ATV -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/etcha-sketch-view.html&quot;&gt;approach quietly please&lt;/a&gt;, serious studying ahead).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/8417804251897728075'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/8417804251897728075'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/11/more-market-research.html' title='More Market Research'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-6347692895125247940</id><published>2011-10-31T10:14:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-12-11T22:53:42.271-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Letter to Allen (Wanderers List)</title><content type='html'>Hi Allen ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Religion&quot; might be a misnomer, so we could say &quot;ethnicity&quot; and imagine one like the Jungian Society, which actively taps psychological resources through rituals involving symbols, dreams, incantations of various kinds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/with-friends-of-jung.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been to some&lt;/a&gt; of these Society&#39;s lectures with Wanderer Nancy.  The venue is a church building, but the content is not specifically Xtian in any way. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not that you can practice all the rituals within the format of a lecture (any more than in the format of a toast).  No, the meeting hall is more for comparing notes and discussing the various dharmas (teachings) one picked up along the way, in whatever vision quest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least one speaker had met with Jung personally, had stories to tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say television successfully spread a world religion of consumerism / shopping that had been hitherto unknown.  Many societies tend towards frugality, ship shape, no excess, minimal -- as an aesthetic, not as a sign of &quot;poverty&quot; (the few assets may be of high net worth).  This notion [of] filling your garage and basement with cruft as a counter to depression and in reward for &quot;working hard&quot; would impress many a wise ass Cro-Magnon as stupid / psychotic to the bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not identify this phenomenon exclusively with &quot;capitalism&quot; however as giving individuals more power as routers, when it comes to spreading assets to nooks and crannies, with guidance from shared screens, might be the basis of a systems science with no special allegiance to the capitalist heroes when it comes to demonizing all competing &quot;isms&quot; (a sign of weakness). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, I regard the standing military as essentially a socialist institution (shared public property, institutional wealth over individual wealth) and the above description matches various soldiering philosophies regarding increased unit autonomy and self-direction within the ranks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the shared focus on &quot;capitals&quot; in the sense of cities, state capitals, might merit the use of this word for some other ideology as well, supranational in focus, urbane and metropolitan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the sake of debate let&#39;s call the new religion &quot;capitalism&quot; while reminding ourselves it&#39;s a rather different &quot;invisible hand&quot; this time, as the investors think more like Jung &amp;amp; Swedenborg than like Smith &amp;amp; Maynard or Marx &amp;amp; Engels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adorno and the Frankfurt School remain influential I would suppose, but I gamble more heavily on Vienna Circle influences, know those horses better (gambling is not verboten in this namespace, or call it &quot;church bingo&quot;).  Yes, I&#39;ll offer myself as an example capitalist in this namespace (aka &quot;designer religion&quot;).  In my case, it&#39;s another fork within Quakerism (we&#39;re dime a dozen on those).  In other tellings, the Unitarians played a pretty big role.

I&#39;ll have to check with the CFO if there&#39;s a financial claim on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/cubby&quot;&gt;the English language word &quot;cubby&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, which works in Scrabble.  Will the King of English sue if I revector it slightly?  Or maybe he&#39;ll join us in this use of the short form of &quot;cubbyhole&quot; (we suppress the &quot;hole&quot; aspect, but don&#39;t deny it completely -- &quot;accentuate the positive&quot; as they say).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
So what&#39;s &quot;cubby&quot;?  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A cubby is an alternative to Pod (not iPod, just Pod), which is another place to park your body while working, quite possibly in cyberspace.  Mostly it&#39;s an alternative to &quot;cubicle&quot;, which most cube farmers know well, as their home-away-from-home.  You get tricked:  buy this expensive home with a mortgage, but then you&#39;re gypped out of getting to live there most the time, as you squeeze into (a) a commuter vehicle, perhaps single occupancy and (b) a cubicle, often without window or privacy, where you get &quot;supervised&quot; for much of your adult life, not unlike elementary school, but they pay you.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
The &quot;cubby&quot; is more of a complete dwelling unit solution and might be added to a camp situation without default demands.  It works will with grid hookups, like an RV, but if these are not available, it works with various more semi-autonomous solutions involving composting, rain water harvesting and solar / wind energy collecting.  We&#39;re talking about a large catalog of Office Depot supplies (you&#39;d think Home Depot but the plywood industry is dead set against us at this point, plywood domes notwithstanding).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
You get an operators manual and getting the thing going feels a lot more like booting a computer than doing upkeep on some ranch style suburban Frank Lloyd Wright wannabe.  You&#39;ve got a lot to learn, and might even need a special school (special ed) before putting &quot;cubby friendly&quot; on your resume.  Like if the first day on the job for Verizon they send you to a call center in the Andes, and you&#39;ve faked knowing the basics, you might not figure out about heat, or how to run the comm center.  Best to not fake it.  Find a retreat center that offers real experience, perhaps through your local church (try Amigos, maybe Steve Martin will take your call).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The Fly&#39;s Eye Dome has become somewhat the signature / logo for the Cubby movement. There&#39;s a sidebar where we alternately heap scorn on, and collect donations for, the cube farmers, who now seem like they&#39;re living on squalor.  There&#39;s &quot;building sickness&quot; and the shame of being gypped.  There&#39;s knowing some of your peers are enjoying life in the Cubby club, whereas you&#39;re still expected to run around in a cube farm, like some rat in a maze, like Algernon before he took the red pill and got smart.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
How does all this relate to CSN, other than we&#39;re thinking of staff housing?  Well, because of the draconian laws against off shore gambling, we&#39;d had to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/08/sounding-off.html&quot;&gt;bring this in house&lt;/a&gt; more in terms of a subscriber service, like cable or satellite.  Then we don&#39;t think of it as gambling, but fundraising, with the games serving a didactic purpose.  Rest assured, we don&#39;t plan on keeping it this way, so completely out of the public eye.  But for now, we have to use the &quot;private party&quot; motif, lest we come across as some unregulated casino trying to escape the Federal jurisdiction.  That might work on Native American properties, but this is Portland, Oregon we&#39;re talking about.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
There is a dome at OPDX by the way, looking something like a Cubby, but that&#39;s mostly a secret. There&#39;s a skin over it, making it look like a regular tent.  Nothing illicit, just under the radar.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Note:  you can wear &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/10/october-look.html&quot;&gt;a Cuffka&lt;/a&gt; in your Cubby, why not?&lt;/div&gt;

People may still have personal listening devices.  The point is to have &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/10/lessons-learned.html&quot;&gt;conversations, meetings, without the interruptions&lt;/a&gt; or distractions of telecommunications.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;People entering such a room are signalling their mutual willingness to suspend contact with the outside world and just focus on the matter at hand.  One might pull out a cell phone to remember a name, but by social convention this might seem gauche.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You might even have a locker system like in a gym, although that adds a layer of inconvenience.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some people simply do not wish to part with their telecommunications devices, especially if not that familiar with an establishment.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &quot;check your phone at the door&quot; policy need not not involve physically parting with your device, although you may wish to park it elsewhere, as a convenience, when heading into a Faraday Room for a long day of intimate discussions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whether the Faraday Room is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage&quot;&gt;actually engineered&lt;/a&gt; to block all wifi and TV-radio would depend on the establishment.

We have a delegation in Nicaragua looking into development projects.  This might be through Friends, though perhaps through FWCC to better protect overseas investors from Americans&#39; xenophobia (have you noticed how guru yogis from India get demonized, whereas the Protestants fan out across the globe &quot;saving souls&quot;?).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CSN is likely to be accused of offering gambling, given the heroics have variable outcomes (sometimes you wipe out) and there&#39;s money involved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The USA is actively defying the WTO these days, which has pointed out the hypocrisy of harboring casinos in properly zoned zip codes, but then saying similar facilities are disqualified from providing their services over the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tight regulations, left over from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/before-prohibition.html&quot;&gt;Prohibition Days&lt;/a&gt; (ongoing) have turned many normal human activities into social crimes against the state.  The USA is one of the most illiberal nations on the books, thanks to its chief hypocrites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In any case, to have brick and mortar studios on the ground, we only need prototype in private residences, by invitation, to get around the OLCC and so forth.  We have already done this many times, as you will find &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/09/coffee-shop-show.html&quot;&gt;memorialized in this blog&lt;/a&gt;, so no news there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &quot;Duke&#39;s Equations&quot; (as some of us call them -- a reminder of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/06/rad-portland.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Duke&#39;s Landing&lt;/span&gt; days&lt;/a&gt;) have already been mastered.  The games come over the wire, and the money goes from some place where it&#39;s authorized, and not in contravention to any law of the seas.  Ships helping other ships in distress, is what it comes down to.  We should not be prevented from offering humanitarian aid, even if we don&#39;t demand obedience to some Christian hierarchy (or whatever religious old guard).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, enough fulminating and pounding the podium or I&#39;ll sound like I&#39;m just another preacher with a large choir to back me up.  That&#39;s not my usual style of marketing, I can assure you.&lt;/div&gt;

Good to catch up some.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Related chatter on the design science and fashion meme: a focus on utilitarian gear, like the old fashioned &lt;i&gt;Boys Life&lt;/i&gt;, but far more diversified and internationalized.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Survivalist&quot; conjures the wrong image as it&#39;s more just about perpetuating DIY skills, developing self reliance as well as a healthy sense of community (they go together).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Learning to grow one&#39;s own food or how to fix a farming tool is hardly &quot;radical&quot; unless you&#39;ve been boxed in by supermarkets your whole life and don&#39;t know any different.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Synchronofile&lt;/i&gt; has published &lt;a href=&quot;http://synchronofile.com/fuller-in-fashion/&quot;&gt;some data&lt;/a&gt; on design science fashion elements.  Groups like to differentiate on the basis of costume (or uniform).  I see no sign of convergence or conformity to a single standard.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/ppug-2009811.html&quot;&gt;Patrick Barton&lt;/a&gt; (Portland Energy Strategies) and I have been yakking about the &quot;smart meter&quot; as related to &quot;smart house&quot; concept for quite awhile, with &quot;urban, semi-urban, rural and wilderness&quot; one of the spectra, when contemplating &quot;dwelling machines&quot; or &quot;sheltering systems&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What do these eco-village (not cube farm) installations have to do with CSN?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They&#39;re potentially &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/04/q.html&quot;&gt;financially powered by games&lt;/a&gt; pulled from stock, with heroics logged (journaled), values reflected, in the profile of the player.  CSN games may not be available through other venues or may only be playable as group activities (some games aren&#39;t for solo play).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By analogy, you go to a sports bar for more that what&#39;s on the LCD.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You and your peers (friends, chronies, co-conspirators) win for these tribes, help sponsor, even as you go and live among them sometimes, as a valued community member (MVP).  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/ecovillage-update-synergeo-33452.html&quot;&gt;Project Earthala meme&lt;/a&gt; is well developed in sister journals.  Think of some school for future diplomats in the Oregon high desert, as one of many worthy funding recipients, accredited through CSN circuits.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Part of the equation is STEM and/or STEAM (&lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/browse_thread/thread/785b1af1d3eae727/4cd7f223eb2657c8?lnk=gst&amp;amp;q=STEAM#4cd7f223eb2657c8&quot;&gt;= STEM + Anthropology&lt;/a&gt;):  what is &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/08/fnb-2011811.html&quot;&gt;a &quot;mathematician&quot;&lt;/a&gt; in this day and age, and might she likewise be an &quot;energy strategist&quot; (an optimizer, a doing-more-with-less pioneer).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Speaking of more-with-less, I was sharing with Steve Holden about my friendship with &lt;a href=&quot;http://kennethsnelson.net/&quot;&gt;Kenneth Snelson&lt;/a&gt; last night, while sitting in the Blue House parking area (where we store the bike trailers, a small part of the fleet).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/snelson/&quot;&gt;Kenneth&lt;/a&gt; grew up in Pendleton, Oregon, but upon becoming &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/more-curriculum-cartoons.html&quot;&gt;a world class artist&lt;/a&gt; with an international following, he settled in Manhattan.  In so doing, he picked up a lot of Jewishisms in the form of sayings and memes, some of which he would teach me about in our at times extensive correspondence.  We talked about &quot;mitzvah&quot; quite a bit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, I&#39;m attending what I call &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/08/pug-97214-launch-event.html&quot;&gt;an &quot;install mitzvah&quot;&lt;/a&gt; where we help someone through the initiation process required to get some new process running on their computer (in this case Python on a Mac).

Other talks, on infrastructure, on community building, and on DIY science, have helped focus some of my conversations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I&#39;m carrying a &quot;We&#39;re Hiring&quot;badge, I&#39;m not here as CSN CMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m toting the totem around, PSF snake.  Chairman Steve suggested we park her at the Perl Foundation booth and that&#39;s where she is right now I&#39;m surmising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other OSCON-related posts are in my other blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the Nebula concept have relevance to CSN growth plans?  I was at their big party last night, but that wasn&#39;t a place for business conversations.  Why not just a pentagonal dodecahedron for edges, instead of something more complicated?  What would we see upon turning it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of 3D (spatial) logos, I think it&#39;s the responsibility of the designers to define its look from all angles, using CAD or other tool, prior to release.  CSN LCDs will feature their share of dancing logos, coats of arms, other heraldry, both 2D and 3D. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or, as some might say, 5D (tetrahedron4 + time1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We believe in Diversity around here.
