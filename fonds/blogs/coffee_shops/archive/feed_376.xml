The profit margin on coffee shops is extremely thin, especially if you subtract adult consumables such as mixed drinks, which most shops do not offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The budget for start ups will have to be for advertising, with the vendor beneficiaries winning the good will sweepstakes, for having taken some initiative.  The games will be family friendly and we probably will not have those adult beverages, except maybe in the usual segregated areas, more like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Spaghetti Factory&lt;/span&gt; in some ways.  YMMV.  Depends on zip code quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/smart-bar-lcds.html&quot;&gt;What&#39;s on the LCDs&lt;/a&gt; is what matters most to some of the stakeholders, and we expect to find alcoves, diversity in tastes.   Not everyone is studying the same topics or cares about the same things.  Geometry cartoons featuring classic polyhedra, no matter for what product (if any), have their own cultish following.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/02/more-from-97214.html&quot;&gt;The NFL&lt;/a&gt; has another, partially overlapping fan base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the sound of it, one might expect universities to jump in, say the MIT student union.  Screens showing hypertoons have that geeky aesthetic one would not be surprised to encounter, if wandering Cambridge or Woodstock (near Reed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also suggested a military lineage, in that some mission-accomplished watercraft, equipped with great kitchens, might retire as tourist attractions in a next chapter, while prototyping whatever kind of philanthropic engine the management has seen fit to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some aircraft might go this route as well.  Serving people in their seats, without leaving the ground -- the model for many a restaurant.  Some who fear flying, might get used to it this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decisions do not bottleneck through me praise Allah, except in the few venues where a management team might include me.  Like with Visa, there&#39;s no uber-boss, plus I&#39;m mostly just wearing a marketing hat (CMO is my title).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sharpness of HDTV is something else to think about.  They change the atmosphere considerably.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By this time one may have asked whether religious establishments might use this same infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many a monastery had and/or has a vendor aspect.  By contributing jam, beer, honey, cheese or whatever goods to the local economy, in barter for wine, exotic beans (or whatever other provisions not obtainable through tended fields), a religious establishment was creating a market niche for itself, creating one or more brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mixing of temple and commercial trade is/was not frowned upon in principle, across multiple branches (denominations) so long as the products remained benign and prayerfully considered (incense... special remedies).  Putting any surplus into wise disbursements, as a result of concentration and study, is what religious academicians do as well as non-religious, however self-labeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The community service nonprofit (or NGO) is a close relative of the religious establishment, another arm for social service.  Many lawmakers would rather have government not compete with more private players, whereas others see too much privacy as a source of abuse.  Either way, one could see where a philanthropic institution might partake of this status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an effort to reach customers where these customers want to be (at sports bars for example), these market leaders will need to test working prototypes, fine tune.  We already have many examples (e.g. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;BackSpace&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CubeSpace&lt;/span&gt;).  The payoff will be getting into the game early, in an adjacent space (close to sports bars in some ways, yet different).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Cult of Athena memes were meant to guide an aesthetic.  The Oracle of Delphi escaped Apollo, meaning these are relaxed venues, not too spartan.  Read back in the archives if curious.  This is a philosophy blog, is not just about business.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/8955804558750504457'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/8955804558750504457'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/02/future-projections.html' title='Future Projections'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-5229535347760420180</id><published>2010-01-30T23:22:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2010-01-30T23:30:09.656-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Coffee Shop Schools</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I&#39;m at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Muddy Waters&lt;/span&gt; listening to an afternoon performance by Amy Bleu while communicating with Saturday Academy regarding this &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/01/back-to-future.html&quot;&gt;&quot;future math&quot; option&lt;/a&gt; (&quot;time machine&quot; theme, summer math camp).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the post below, re &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Adrenaline Week&lt;/span&gt;, there&#39;s this hand-drawn thermometer showing whatever funds have come in, but is that really sufficient?  Obviously one needs to account for the pennies, show what&#39;s coming in, what&#39;s going out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the utopian future of philanthropic coffee shops, the story might be given a more visual form.  If someone makes an earmarked donation at the point of sale, some control panel shows that amount going to that particular bucket, adding to the total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this is open source software, geeks know this visualization isn&#39;t fudged.  These are real numbers tied to real accounts, and if you need the transactions in spreadsheet form, or as csv files, that might be arranged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The model needs to be reconfigurable.  Running a fundraiser for the house is different than hosting a teach-in and committing the funds to some worthy cause or charity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the books in &quot;cartoon form&quot; is what CEOs and CFOs hope to get as well -- some synoptic colorful visualization that shows clearly what&#39;s going on with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s a difficult challenge sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coffee shops might be able to pull it off though, given the relatively simple business model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The software should be replicable to multiple shops and not completely ad hoc.  Economies of scale enter in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As CMO for CSN, am I able to write all this software and put it on line?  Are my Python visualizations LCD-ready?  Do I have all the Javascript written and ready to go?  Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been harping on this idea of more game-like front ends for bookkeeping systems for quite awhile now.  Yes, it&#39;s a great idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the TV-soaked world we live in, I&#39;m thinking a tilt towards the graphical might rescue the lexical.  Making money management a kind of video game is not a waste of bandwidth, it&#39;s a way of including the TV-literate public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absent transparency, fundraisers tend to fizzle, as do the organizations behind them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amy Bleu grew up in Hawaii and plays a mean ukelele.  She&#39;s donating any proceeds from sales, of CDs or T-shirts, to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muddywatersportland.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Muddy&#39;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Maybe the thermometer will go up a tick.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/7728329026570585555'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/7728329026570585555'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/01/bookkeeping-cartoons.html' title='Bookkeeping Cartoons'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4018/4261248028_9679496be7_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-5414427250090052488</id><published>2010-01-06T08:53:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2010-01-14T08:30:20.633-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Adrenaline Week</title><content type='html'>&lt;span class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Forwarding from Myspace, regarding a coffee shop in SE Belmont area, Portland, Oregon:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.muddywatersportland.com/&quot;&gt;Muddywaters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, a non-profit work owned coffee shop, that supports independent artists and the underprivileged is having a benefit event all this week. They just opened their new expanded music and art venue out back called &quot;Flipside&quot;, but after pouring all their effort into it they have fallen short on rent and have to pay it this week or they are out. We are inviting any musicians that want to play to come and help us rock this house. We have all kinds of different fund raising going on, but we want to invite people to come out and check out the space and support it. We are scheduling musicians from noon to 10PM everyday, and after that the amps have to be unplugged and we go acoustic. If you want to play, email lindseywalkermusic@gmail.com or cojo23@gmail.com. If you want to support a truly equitable socially just space come out and party with us and tell your friends. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Muddy&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; has had dinners for the homeless recently that fed over a hundred and have had events to benefit the homeless.

Given my Quaker affiliations and this sect&#39;s historical alliance with original Americans, I&#39;m more of a regional casino booster than some of my Christian peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the CSN design is rather different from the traditional gambling casino&#39;s.  It lets players exercise choice when committing funds through these computer systems and uses a portion of vendor profits (donated back to charity) as a funding source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The traditional gambler is directing winnings to himself or herself, with losings going to the house (as house winnings).  The socially responsible gamer is committing a vendor-provided payload to a worthy program and building a track record.  The vendor receives various metrics regarding giving patterns, sharing glory with the players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well designed games have the potential to build brand loyalty and repeat patronage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oregon Lottery is another example of funding going from bars and taverns across the land into state coffers.  Players have no control over what happens to those funds, as they&#39;re considered &quot;lost&quot; (no longer under patron control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of 2009, many misanthropic gaming systems still serve as recruiting tools for purveyors of anti-social, violent lifestyles.  The idea of using games &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/12/more-world-game.html&quot;&gt;as recruiting tools&lt;/a&gt; is worth keeping, even if we switch focus to philanthropic engineering.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/6019002697971444736'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/6019002697971444736'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/12/quaker-view.html' title='A Quaker View'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-7694423156141880727</id><published>2009-12-15T08:14:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2010-01-06T05:54:40.033-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Economic Theory</title><content type='html'>Left over from &quot;artificial persons&quot; days, when corporations worked for us, and not the other way around, the more profitable engines would plow surplus back into the community under the assets column of &quot;building good will&quot;.  These assets could offset some liabilities, thereby contributing to net worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One way of building good will was to simply donate to charity.  Keeping good jobs available in a local community is another way to earn loyalty for one&#39;s brand.  If a company earmarked some profit for charity, this could be claimed on tax forms as an alternative to government spending i.e. the artificial person could do its own earmarking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward to the present day and you have ways to track nickles and dimes to the micro level.  Charitable giving might be packaged to ride with a sale item as part of the payload, feeding a point of sale game system that encourages customer participation in charitable giving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company may pre-select targets in board meetings.  Customers have a choice of games (as well as products) plus the option to let the charitable donation funnel to a default cause or charity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given this is turning into another description of &lt;a href=&quot;https://wanderers.pbworks.com/CoffeeShopsNetwork&quot;&gt;the CSN business model&lt;/a&gt;, let&#39;s raise the objection that all of the above could be accomplished from the comfort of one&#39;s own dorm room i.e. purchasing on-line and getting to donate a portion of the profit to charity shouldn&#39;t require leaving one&#39;s chair (I&#39;ve been getting that objection lately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answer:  this is correct however it&#39;s not either/or.  The CSN framework is suitable for use in a coffee shop setting, is geared for a kind of study hall environment (various degrees of freedom pertain, per other sketches).  Some people are not looking for more time home alone and would welcome observing others at play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to theory:  we have &quot;anonymous giving&quot; in our model, however when it comes to building good will, both companies and individuals tend to want some way to make a link in the public mindset, thereby building brand loyalty and/or individual reputation.  Having one&#39;s heroics as a game player on record is somewhat the athletic model, with sports champions role modeling their dedication to a walk and a talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to advances in record keeping, giving customers a way to scroll their play records for world-readable display is not an impossible undertaking, as it would have been just decades ago.  These displays then become a part of the social networking currency, as parties seek each other out based on mutuality and/or complementary agendas and objectives.  New companies form by this process.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/7694423156141880727'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/7694423156141880727'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/12/economic-theory.html' title='Economic Theory'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-6128308009630262154</id><published>2009-12-08T03:39:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2009-12-08T04:26:22.911-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Study Hall</title><content type='html'>This work/study track means plowing through the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Laughing Horse&lt;/span&gt; collection at a high rate.  It&#39;s an opportunity, a window.  4D Studios, connected in my own mind to the Portland Knowledge Lab (a collection, an archive, for more studios than just mine) has only so much time to compare notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today it&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Times of Harvey Milk&lt;/span&gt;, the documentary, not the recent movie.  I&#39;ve seen this before but a long time ago and I forget where.  Also &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Crisis&lt;/span&gt;, by ABC TV, about the breakdown of apartheid in Alabama under pressure from Kennedy brothers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latter has a lot of amazingly good and candid material, a testament to the professionalism of the film makers, who obviously had the trust of the an inner circle cast of political players, including the Alabama governor George Wallace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two students were perfect for their roles I thought.  The guy&#39;s quip that he&#39;d like to be governor someday as in &quot;yes, I&#39;m your worst nightmare&quot; was good humored and smart (what I don&#39;t know right now is how long ABC kept this film in the can).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The former is of course a landmark, award winning film. The scene where people are smashing into a building while the sound track shouts &quot;no more violence!&quot; was worth a rewind and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local time zone has become less important given the realities of Cyberia.

For the first time in his life, he was feeling underhanded, like a cad.  The game was providing this experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how would a philanthropy game look?  You&#39;d have cities needing to thrive and there&#39;d be competition with other programs and ideologies.  If they lob bombs to keep you in the Stone Age, to make themselves look better by comparison, that&#39;d be noticed by the other players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US Army spent millions on a recuriting game that teaches teamwork and a hunger for army life.  This is world game in a nutshell, though hell bent in some dimensions.  Similar games serve to recruit others from their matrix, such as &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Uru&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Second Life&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Spore&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If wanting a reputation as a philanthropist, you might consider funding game development.  Coffee Shops Network (CSN) is about supplying an ambience in which such games get played.  One need not sit solo in one&#39;s office or den.  One needn&#39;t be secretive nor furtive when helping humanity, although aspects of game play, e.g. outsmarting misanthropists, will have their sneakier aspects.

A typical autobiography will contain a mix of both, with the author shifting to more omniscient tones when needing to provide more context.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not every coffee shop will want to program these circles, but we increasingly have customers prepared with five minute thumbnails about their lives.  Onlookers who realize this is an emerging genre will get to work on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short versions are often distillations of the longer ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jflory.org/family_history.htm&quot;&gt;here&#39;s a link&lt;/a&gt; to a family history with autobiographical components by Jim Flory.  He and I have worked together around several Quaker events and have in common this attribute of growing up in the Philippines, myself as the son in a post-WW2 technical family doing development planning, himself as the son of prisoner of war missionaries (heading for China) in a Japanese internment camp in Baguio (the USA federation had &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/adult-first-day-program.html&quot;&gt;some similar camps&lt;/a&gt; for those of Japanese heritage during this same time period).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a kind of &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/lunar-coffee-shop.html&quot;&gt;cross-roads coffee shop&lt;/a&gt;, with visitors from many corners, you&#39;ll get some exotic autobiographies and these will tend to tie together for listeners, as they come to see a common backdrop of history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not underestimate the value of this opportunity, probably worth some energy and work on fine tuning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your shop keeps an archive on the web, remember to invite your guests to post links to their web sites.

It is not the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; that has a grammar, it is the actuality in the world&lt;br /&gt;&gt; of &quot;consciousness&quot; that has a grammar.  Then, it is&lt;br /&gt;&gt; well if our linguistic grammars, and our use of the&lt;br /&gt;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot;, correspond to the distal&lt;br /&gt;&gt; facts.  Sean speaks of &quot;assertability conditions&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; That may head in some problematic directions, but&lt;br /&gt;&gt; it&#39;s the same kind of concept.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 51, 0);&quot;&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://seanwilson.org/&quot;&gt;Sean&#39;s use&lt;/a&gt; of &quot;languaging&quot; helps move us from noun-sense to &lt;a href=&quot;http://hearingvoices.com/news/2009/03/i-seem-to-be-a-verb/&quot;&gt;verb-sense&lt;/a&gt; i.e. to a post nominalist sensibility.  It&#39;s not that the word &#39;cat&#39; and the thing (cat) are related as proximal to distal (the word might be on a distant bill board, the real deal in your lap) but that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;both&lt;/span&gt; have semantic value in a grammar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 51, 0);&quot;&gt; For suburbanite Americans going to community college, maybe taking philosophy at night school (a prerequisite for foreign service at some levels), I might translate &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.units.muohio.edu/technologyandhumanities/Wittgenstein.htm&quot;&gt;grammar&lt;/a&gt;&quot; as &quot;lifestyle&quot;.

The business class set, on the clock and/or on Skype to the home office, is not at all bothered by all the commotion in some bat cave, out of sight if not mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small venues that don&#39;t have the floorspace to accommodate these diverse uses in parallel (simultaneously), may take a more sequential approach (asynchronous), using &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-about-lcds.html&quot;&gt;the LCDs&lt;/a&gt; to effectively display when &quot;quiet time&quot; will be over, when karaoke is set to commence.  Art galleries may feature loud music only once or twice a month.  Libraries may never.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I&#39;m not about promising &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;amp;friendId=480007428&amp;amp;blogId=512223898&quot;&gt;free strippers and drugs&lt;/a&gt; in every venue (it&#39;s not mine to give the blue light in most cases), but in other venues, that&#39;s sometimes what&#39;s on the menu.  Or perhaps you&#39;ve got bar credits thanks to your stellar world game playing, so technically the goods are more in trade than for free.  Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some coffee bars cater to minors, others don&#39;t.  The TV-rating system applies, not only to the stage magic, but to what goes to the LCDs (if they&#39;ve got any).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ambient culture has only a few paradigms (templates, grammars) to blend from.  Following Python as a model, an eclectic computer language, we&#39;re free to pick and choose (&quot;cherry picking&quot; is a sin when doing statistics, but not when collecting antiques or memorabilia, art works, examples of esoteric crafts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;ve got the tavern, sports bar, coffee shop, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/proprietary-games.html&quot;&gt;video arcade&lt;/a&gt;, art gallery, strip club, country club, eating club, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/gift-shop-ideas.html&quot;&gt;gift shop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/show-tell-lounge.html&quot;&gt;TV studio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/study-hall.html&quot;&gt;science museum&lt;/a&gt;, public eatery, inn, bed &amp;amp; breakfast, back office, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/07/building-library.html&quot;&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, VIP lounge... Victorian salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Branding in this phase space requires serious attention to your market niche, and that means having a clear sense of your clientèle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#39;t be all things to all people, nor should you even set out to please in this direction.  If you&#39;re attracting young families with children, maybe you want a play area, for kids who wish to escape adult conversation.  Portland has its share of brew pubs working this model and doing a good job of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clear markings on the doorway aimed at scaring off the complainers, who won&#39;t like what they find, is a proprietor&#39;s responsibility, as well as a kindness to customers.  People who weren&#39;t warned often feel justified in acting offended.  Learn your community codes and post the relevant warnings (e.g. no minors permitted), not just enticements.  Use eye candy to repel, not just attract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t pretend your welcome mat applies equally to everyone.  Be gracious with tourists however, as that&#39;s how to increase your fan base, should such be your goal.  Establishments with no protocol for serving first timers, customers semi-innocent of a shop&#39;s culture, are likely to whither on the vine through attrition.  Having too many people packed into a confined space is in itself a disincentive (a turn off), not to mention a red flag for the fire marshal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all boils down to truth in advertising. Give a clear sense of what you deliver at your venue, and then deliver it, consistently, whatever your secret sauce (value added).  If you attract too large a crowd, don&#39;t be shy about throttling back on promotion.  There &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; such a thing as too much advertising (also called over-exposure).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/3240017608406830948'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/3240017608406830948'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/10/lessons-learned.html' title='Lessons Learned'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-7653252770815655459</id><published>2009-09-20T22:25:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-29T15:55:04.443-07:00</updated><title type='text'>A Coffee Shop Show</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

Hats off to ya then!  (a willing gesture of admiration and respect -- not edict-enforced by naked emperor types).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the philosophy circuit, I&#39;ve been suggesting a &lt;a href=&quot;http://seanwilson.org/forum/index.php?t=msg&amp;amp;goto=606&amp;amp;S=2432bf0f53f9696610d148159c6faff0#msg_606&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Politics of the Organs &lt;/span&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; of publications, looking at how people have changed their discourse about guts a lot.  The brain has become really important since its &quot;air conditioner for the blood&quot; career (some truth in that, however metaphoric).  Remember how &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pituitary&quot;&gt;the pituitary gland&lt;/a&gt; used to be core in philosophy?  Or was it &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineal_gland&quot;&gt;the neighboring pineal&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you get the picture.  Phrenology was a harbinger of modern day brain talk, even if only a quack science in large degree (it might have helped spread &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5278228n&amp;amp;tag=contentMain;contentBody&quot;&gt;the use of helmets&lt;/a&gt;, some other beneficial side effect, so don&#39;t expect a long rant from me against such a dead-already horse -- life is short).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a book circle meet in your shop would be excellent, thinking of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Laughing Horse&lt;/span&gt; here in Portland for example, where some of us go sometimes, also &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;In Other Words&lt;/span&gt; on Killingsworth, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/08/education-planning.html&quot;&gt;where I represented as CMO&lt;/a&gt; for this network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they sit there with Kindles or like devices, toted in tote bags, riding on bicycles, we wouldn&#39;t diss them for that.  Street youth have smarts sometimes, weren&#39;t all just born yesterday even if they look like it sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to my original point, go ahead and shop at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Trader Joe&#39;s&lt;/span&gt;, without fear of any reprimands from me.  I go to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fred Meyer&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; (a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Kroger&lt;/span&gt; chain) even where others are boycotting out of principle.  I enjoy free spirited debate across these kinds of lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s all Congress is doing, getting paid to do it, professionally.  I&#39;m envious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I often think about public figures with some sense of awe and appreciation, as I would about star NFL players &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/like-narnia-in-pdx.html&quot;&gt;if I were really into NFL&lt;/a&gt; (sorry guys -- but I do get it sometimes, like the half time thing (including Ms. Jackson&#39;s)).  I watch military people too, phasing over into paramilitary.  Who can blame me for watching the circus?  Isn&#39;t that why they call it a theater sometimes?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/5456789340171443634'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/5456789340171443634'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/08/traitor-joes.html' title='Traitor Joe&#39;s?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-3351831274251035457</id><published>2009-08-03T22:38:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2009-08-03T23:00:25.729-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Graphics Library</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbDDO_M_N0FXSO19j9v5ShBVahUa5HWt3c8D2yxX0hHGohNj7GyaBf06eqLDDg8Is8rmu22mVEhwwiGmQMvQjUDb_WNc8ElhjxPjzZOZndHuG9oRL0sIQyiQ2hgjrxR7X0AZC5QkPpDGIE/s1600-h/rdpack2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 245px; height: 239px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbDDO_M_N0FXSO19j9v5ShBVahUa5HWt3c8D2yxX0hHGohNj7GyaBf06eqLDDg8Is8rmu22mVEhwwiGmQMvQjUDb_WNc8ElhjxPjzZOZndHuG9oRL0sIQyiQ2hgjrxR7X0AZC5QkPpDGIE/s320/rdpack2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5365982214439332002&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A library of a different type (see below) is in software.  People don&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel at every turn and have a well-developed practice of passing libraries back and forth, value adding, developing a common set of tools. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#39;t keep our coder girls from competing with one another, just the shared library levels the playing field plus heightens the level of play, so everyone wins, even if sometimes one loses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OpenGL type stuff I&#39;ve been yakking up with my students is capable of driving the 4D video games I&#39;ve been marketing.  4D in this namespace means &quot;friendly to the enterprising of Bucky Fuller&quot;, who tended to brand his work 4D, with sound mathematical reasons for doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/&quot;&gt;4D Solutions&lt;/a&gt; has developed additional resources in this same area, but mostly in the form of &quot;cave paintings&quot; (defined more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig/&quot;&gt;on edu-sig&lt;/a&gt; at Python.org).  Full scale FOSS libraries develop within communities of co-developers, using tools such as Mercurial and Git.  Some of our philanthropic games will derive from this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/synergetica.html&quot;&gt;4D IVM&lt;/a&gt; and 3D XYZ have a lot in common, with the latter dominating in the 1970s, defining a signature rectilinear look.  You&#39;ll recognize &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/glass-bead-game.html&quot;&gt;4D&lt;/a&gt; from its signature space frame, the octahedron-tetrahedron truss (the long winded name for it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/sphpack.html&quot;&gt;Stacked fruit&lt;/a&gt; is a typical hallmark, both triangular and square based.

Inquiries about giving out live animals, including with award ceremonies, need not be directed to some nebulous CSN &quot;global hub&quot; as we really care more about local community standards, are more like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; in that way (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/wanderers-20081119.html&quot;&gt;Unilever&lt;/a&gt;).  Pet policies cannot be set from on high, by some emperor with no clothes (see above).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the high cost of fuel, running empty is a waste, and lots of salt water aquariums could be heading into Kabul, feeding a growing network of tropical fish huts in that area.  If the local coffee shops wanna jump in, who&#39;s to stop &#39;em?&lt;br /&gt;

Remember when &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/one-whale-of-wanderer.html&quot;&gt;Keiko&lt;/a&gt; got to ride on a military type aircraft, or at least cargo freight?  Keiko was the star of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Free Willy&lt;/span&gt; and needed to see the world, especially Norway.  Likewise, staff in the Iraqi version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-bday-sarah.html&quot;&gt;Sea World&lt;/a&gt; might want to move around, rotate.  A few hours in a saltwater tank can&#39;t be that bad, if done right.  &quot;Take her through Manas!&quot; could be the order of the day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/slowing-down.html&quot;&gt;Extracting heavy weapons&lt;/a&gt; takes time, so as long as we have &quot;air ships&quot; running both ways, lets stock some shops, get that stimulus happening.  Christmas in July is blatantly about civilian gift giving.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/9114876897862392028'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/9114876897862392028'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/07/pets-as-gifts.html' title='Pets as Gifts'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/9JDzlhW3XTM/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-5150954116710756464</id><published>2009-06-26T19:47:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-27T18:04:51.105-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Greek Mythology</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2Wz3TYnAY6BEkrldylMoUVUKiML4L9JR0PHfTTY9cqgJdGjnalBXhrmH5xmcVVeYXl7l326vHkyy1tg6K_dUNjpMFWtMC63BBt_RuB6CsuHtJBl01p9DvVlu8fdeBqgX6QPY0gLMtotRN/s1600-h/slide34.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 242px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2Wz3TYnAY6BEkrldylMoUVUKiML4L9JR0PHfTTY9cqgJdGjnalBXhrmH5xmcVVeYXl7l326vHkyy1tg6K_dUNjpMFWtMC63BBt_RuB6CsuHtJBl01p9DvVlu8fdeBqgX6QPY0gLMtotRN/s320/slide34.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5351846237176438994&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: python for teachers, slide 34 ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given our transparently &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/featured-polyhedron.html&quot;&gt;big investment in Polyhedra&lt;/a&gt; as connotative of both civilization and rational thought, you might assume we&#39;re &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/greek-polytheism.html&quot;&gt;an Apollonian enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the idea of a &quot;philosophy bar&quot; (aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/salons-dot-net.html&quot;&gt;salon&lt;/a&gt;) sounds rather Dionysian and therefore oxymoronic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will our customers stay focused and rational if they&#39;re becoming intoxicated on adult beverages (e.g. &lt;a style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-source.html&quot;&gt;Jack Daniels&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-on-t-shirts.html&quot;&gt;or whatever&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before answering that directly, let&#39;s remember that Apollonian intelligence was preceded by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crystalinks.com/delphi.html&quot;&gt;older Delphian network&lt;/a&gt;, for whom the snake was an emblem.  These oracles were rumored to get high (intoxicated) on fumes emanating from the rock itself (or from some tripod).  In other words, this was an ancient shamanistic cult of medicine women, spearheaded by Athena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Apollo decided a hostile takeover was in order, or at least a rebranding, he chased the &quot;dragon&quot; out of town, killed it or whatever (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/pythonic-means-pithy.html&quot;&gt;accounts vary&lt;/a&gt;), and later Athenians got used to the idea of this more policed way of life (Apollo was &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/08/affordable-utopias.html&quot;&gt;more fascist&lt;/a&gt; in some ways, although not exactly another Mars, like in Sparta).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This so-called &quot;she dragon&quot; (a spirit) was named Python and so these good Delphian priestesses were likewise known as Pythians (like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3216538482/&quot;&gt;Pythonistas&lt;/a&gt;).  The word &quot;python&quot; traces to the verb &quot;to rot&quot; i.e. the fumes might&#39;ve been sulfurous or at least nasty-smelling (&quot;a witches brew&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one ever suggested these were unintelligent or unprofessional women, even though use of intoxicants was a part of their job description.  They just weren&#39;t Apollonian in outlook, at least at first, so in hindsight it&#39;s understandable why the uninitiated might assume a purely Dionysian operation. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Mythology/Hephaestus.html&quot;&gt;Hephaestus&lt;/a&gt; was more Vulcan though, an engineer really -- talking about Python&#39;s dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answering more directly:  it&#39;s not a given that any particular customer will remain in a proper frame of mind for whatever business is at hand, nor is it the responsibility of poor slobs in management to carefully monitor everyone&#39;s intake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas the entwined snakes of Hermes, or mono snake of Aesculapius, suggest a &quot;heal thyself&quot; philosophy (akin to the Socratic &quot;know thyself&quot; maxim), this is a commitment for each individual customer to undertake, not a job for some Big Brother on steroids, not a job description for some psychiatric &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J74Yj2Dn8M8&quot;&gt;nurse Ratched&lt;/a&gt; ala &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course we&#39;ll do a lot with &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-about-lcds.html&quot;&gt;the LCDs&lt;/a&gt; around these themes, including in our own commercials, but let&#39;s not overlook the fun of having real, palpable mythology books on the shelves, so-called &quot;coffee table&quot; tomes (more expensive), along with childrens books, scholarly hardcovers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157600270460732/&quot;&gt;Marvel comics&lt;/a&gt; or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSN2bViTRv5tI9m-_6qpt4e3PN3Je3qTkUxTE6w7YwuC5hJN2LRkGZRAhiUoGU8cuhDqc-S2RnDhJQPXt9za2ze0XtOVYoT3wUEFyfbcNjEsar9FK4-Ib9l5EVxbQzV6xVR3602rwImg6i/s1600-h/caduceus.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 180px; height: 241px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSN2bViTRv5tI9m-_6qpt4e3PN3Je3qTkUxTE6w7YwuC5hJN2LRkGZRAhiUoGU8cuhDqc-S2RnDhJQPXt9za2ze0XtOVYoT3wUEFyfbcNjEsar9FK4-Ib9l5EVxbQzV6xVR3602rwImg6i/s320/caduceus.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5352178108920214162&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/5150954116710756464'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/5150954116710756464'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/greek-mythology.html' title='Greek Mythology'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2Wz3TYnAY6BEkrldylMoUVUKiML4L9JR0PHfTTY9cqgJdGjnalBXhrmH5xmcVVeYXl7l326vHkyy1tg6K_dUNjpMFWtMC63BBt_RuB6CsuHtJBl01p9DvVlu8fdeBqgX6QPY0gLMtotRN/s72-c/slide34.png" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-7862477338846150509</id><published>2009-06-21T20:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2015-02-10T11:45:06.309-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Carrotmob Helps Merchants</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

at &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;OS Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a way to promote socially responsible gaming (and Python) as a means of community service i.e. a mode of working (and playing) &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/women-and-foss.html&quot;&gt;more women&lt;/a&gt; might appreciate (a theme of this slide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more context, here&#39;s a link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/presentations/osbridge2009.pdf&quot;&gt;the PDF version&lt;/a&gt; of the entire presentation (6.5 MB), where our open source &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/open-source.html&quot;&gt;business model&lt;/a&gt; figures in passing (we have lots of imitators already).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Followup:  so I attended &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/sessions/115&quot;&gt;Gabrielle Roth&#39;s talk&lt;/a&gt; on this very topic of women in FOSS, her local &quot;code &#39;n splode&quot; giving techy women some venting time to compare notes on various outrages and offenses (men are allowed, but don&#39;t get to sit in front).  She gave a thumbs up on the &quot;FOSS covens&quot; meme, part of how the witches are beating the priests in the &quot;good works&quot; department these days (sorry Charlie, go whine to the Pope if you have a problem with that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interesting group dynamic in that this gay guy in the audience they all knew assumed interrupt privileges, even after all those slides about directly countering such privilege-taking.  He tried to hijack the speaker&#39;s workflow during the Q&amp;amp;A, an explicit no-no.  I shushed him real loud, like &quot;hey, loud guy!&quot; (finger across the neck motion).  I might get in trouble for doing that, but hey, I&#39;m a guy, so who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of group dynamics, apparently some OSCON 2007 BOF on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Women in FOSS&lt;/span&gt; kind of degenerated, still part of the lore among this inner circle.  I wasn&#39;t at said BOF, dunno what went down, but do think of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/women-and-foss.html&quot;&gt;OSCON 2008&lt;/a&gt; as a turning point in some ways, in getting us back on track vis-a-vis our core motivation (world domination).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/4343629696882417589'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/5073803905669866844/posts/default/4343629696882417589'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/os-bridge-conference.html' title='OS Bridge Conference'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjwE4qkxvPmmETFO0aCH99zvC0h6XWUITd0BIfV8bUvbfenHJOeN0AmWp9gs6jNLWexdaCEHtzKriEQMyNZfIOUAjGkneXMRzeRBy7nZzWBQLj11e9WZ7mWBNdXOwJVK65UsR7fkkMfoPhF/s72-c/cto.png" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5073803905669866844.post-5769906999422138659</id><published>2009-06-14T08:47:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-14T16:08:45.880-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Study Hall</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.sciencefriday.com/tools/players/mediaplayer.swf&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; wmode=&quot;opaque&quot; flashvars=&quot;&amp;amp;file=http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.flv?http://media.libsyn.com/media/sciencefriday/slither-061209.flv&amp;amp;height=255&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;frontcolor=0xffffff&amp;amp;backcolor=0xeeeecc&amp;amp;lightcolor=0xFFFFFF&amp;amp;showdigits=false&amp;amp;autostart=false&amp;amp;showicons=false&amp;amp;usefullscreen=true&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;image=http://www.sciencefriday.com/video/videoicon/snakeslither.jpg&amp;amp;callback=http://www.sciencefriday.com/test/vidstats.php&amp;amp;id=10223&amp;amp;showdownload=true&amp;amp;link=http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp4?http://media.libsyn.com/media/sciencefriday/slither-061209.mp4&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; height=&quot;255&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;from Ira Flatow&#39;s Science Friday:  snake locomotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of our more youthful readers are thinking this is just boring old study hall, dressed up with scones and/or Brazilian cheese bread (yum), and they&#39;re right in some ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In today&#39;s world, we somewhat assume you&#39;re carrying a personal headset, so if you don&#39;t want to buy new or share the communal pair, simply jack in with your very own (like the ones in the seat pocket in front of you, that airlines just give away sometimes (but we lose them, rat pack the garage)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall effect, even with all that frenetic game playing under the surface, winning big time for your teams, is a somewhat hushed environment, meaning you have room for intimate conversation without shouting.  There&#39;s a buzz.  Sometimes there&#39;s a didjeridu (and not just on headphones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#39;s also in error to posit one steady ambiance for all times and seasons, as a shop has a life of its own, its rhythms, and you&#39;re not going to see the same Harry Potter types at all times of day (considering &quot;a day&quot; to be &quot;one 24 hour period&quot;).  Maybe it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/show-tell-lounge.html&quot;&gt;karaoke night&lt;/a&gt; and your customers are singing their hearts out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have multiple CSN hangouts, you&#39;ll get a roving loyal base, with the quieter types frequenting the less loud locations, nothing to stop the Trappists from doing one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/span&gt;, my little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157616066135225/&quot;&gt;Slytherin group&lt;/a&gt; comes through only occasionally, in which case the shadows flicker and a film noir track kicks in on the sound system, activated by remote sensor (just jokin&#39; with ya, adds to the tone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or more likely, I&#39;m perched in &lt;a href=&quot;http://pdxfinegrind.blogspot.com/2009/05/metal-plaster-wood-show-artworks.html&quot;&gt;the corner&lt;/a&gt;, more like Bob Cratchet, trying to makes sense to this scrooge Uncle Sam.  Or am I more Mellville&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0230025/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bartleby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?
