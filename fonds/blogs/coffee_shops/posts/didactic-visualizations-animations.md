I'm glad I caught the Tomi Ungerer bio, [Far Out is not Far Out Enough](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1974254/).  Like me, he's a pioneer in the edgy cartoons area and sees andragogy as distinct from, yet inter-mixed with, pedagogy.  We have ratings for a reason.

What caught people off guard is he was spanning G (General Audience) to MA (Mature Audience) with the same aesthetic, unifying the levels in some sense.

Was that interference in childhood innocence?  The Puritans thought so.

My agenda is a little different:  to impart technical content but to not eschew the animated form, even the demented or unrated.

Take these excellent lectures [by Sapolsky at Standford](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&feature=share&list=PL848F2368C90DDC3D) for example, and imagine the animated reveries that could go with them, ala [this movie on Chomsky](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/12/is-man-who-is-tall-happy-movie-review.html), or these well-known [RSA lectures](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOP2V_np2c0).

Or I think of the more Bakshi / MAD style in [the Morton Downy documentary](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/01/anchorman-2-movie-review.html).

Having a "movie track" for a lecture adds value.   Using animations is not "dumbing it down" even where higher and lower math, and quantum physics is concerned.

In our coffee shops, I don't necessarily want to monopolize the audio track, though an ear buds "airplane seat" setup might be used.  You get the reveries disconnected from the anchoring lectures and maybe spliced together by enthusiasts.

That's OK, as our coffee shop is more trafficking in a "meme soup" than in any particular subject or discipline.  We're providing ambiance, an atmosphere conducive to study and / or daydreaming, but we're not necessarily directly competing with the Apollonian Academy.   We're complementary.
