In my "win games for charity" model, we channel computer game competitiveness to philanthropy. Score big in some first person shooter, and choose to donate winnings to the local church fundraiser. Like video lottery but player takes responsibility, including by building a giving history profile. Know me by the causes I've supported, by playing games. I call it Coffee Shops Network and make the business plan open source so no one can patent it out from under me.
