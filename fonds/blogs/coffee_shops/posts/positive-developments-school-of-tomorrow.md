The 52 Living Ideas channel, anchored by Shrikant, is NYC-based.  In the video, I link it to Philadelphia, which it is through CJ, one of the Philadelphians co-appearing with Shrikant on overlapping channels.Quoting CJ: Shrikant operates out of New York City. I've only met him via telephone and video conference.
His 52 Living Ideas group has world around participation. During COVID, there is no local: it's a global pandemic: we're all in it together.
