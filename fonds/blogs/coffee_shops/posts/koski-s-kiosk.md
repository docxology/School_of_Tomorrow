Koski's Kiosk is great alliteration and [will go forward](https://www.youtube.com/@dekay5555555/videos) in the literature, website or no.

Perhaps a synonym for "module" in the "tetrahedral wedge" sense, could be "kiosk". A tetrahedral voxel within a family consisting of family members E&T, S, A&B. Or these could be subway lines.

At the stations, the Kiosks appear as actual newstands with "read all about it" headlines regarding the Koski Identities.Â 

Picturing like Japanese anime, hypertoons with chill beats.
