Hypertoon treatment would be ideal for communicating Synergetics, because of the partially overlapping scenarios configuration.

A hypertoon is like a spaghetti ball of short cartoons (animations) terminating in switch points where smooth segues (transitions) may occur.

Synergetics suggests lots of animated sequences, such as an octahedron turing into a "boat" and spiralling forward or backward ("arcing").  Does this scenario serve any useful scientific purpose?  As a Platonist, I'm just following the tetrahelix thread.

Another transformation is of course the Jitterbug, at the center of the Concentric Hierarchy as a unifying "bow tie Universe" pulsation device (one could say).  Telling the story of the Jitterbug and its "station stops" is traversing a kind of backbone, from which many side stories branch out.

In more recent autobiographical videos I talk about a Pycon in Washington, DC where I was scheduled to talk more about hypertoons.  I actually did get to give such a talk, at a different Pycon in DC, if memory serves. Dawn joined me on that trip.  When was that?
