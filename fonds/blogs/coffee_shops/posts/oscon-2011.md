The trend towards gamification of UIs, in cars and elsewhere, is a theme of one of the keynotes this morning.  Other talks, on infrastructure, on community building, and on DIY science, have helped focus some of my conversations.Although I'm carrying a "We're Hiring"badge, I'm not here as CSN CMO.I'm toting the totem around, PSF snake.  Chairman Steve suggested we park her at the Perl Foundation booth and that's where she is right now I'm surmising.My other OSCON-related posts are in my other blogs.Does the Nebula concept have relevance to CSN growth plans?  I was at their big party last night, but that wasn't a place for business conversations.  Why not just a pentagonal dodecahedron for edges, instead of something more complicated?  What would we see upon turning it?On the topic of 3D (spatial) logos, I think it's the responsibility of the designers to define its look from all angles, using CAD or other tool, prior to release.  CSN LCDs will feature their share of dancing logos, coats of arms, other heraldry, both 2D and 3D. Or, as some might say, 5D (tetrahedron4 + time1).We believe in Diversity around here.  Lots of comparing notes with people from Brazil.
