[Lilymoth](http://www.flickr.com/photos/76598551@N00/) is a grown up goth who cheerfully and professionally trimmed my shaggy gray locks this afternoon, even though, on a spring day such as this, she might rather be in her garden, arranging these tableaus with her doll collection.Originally from Detroit, she was entranced [by Blue Meanies](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/stress-tests.html) (Yellow Submarine) at an early age.Her stag beetle tattoo is right at home amidst the foliage, some bones recently added, celebrating her becoming a grandma at 41.Portland is blessed.
