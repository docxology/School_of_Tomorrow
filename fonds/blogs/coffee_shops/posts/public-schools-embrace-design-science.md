Not all at once mind you. A blend of computer science + the humanities is ready to roll forward without disturbing the math teaching rank and file, which are boxed in by standards. 

Our impact on other STEM subjects is more by osmosis and organic growth than because of any top-down campaign led by think tanks, not that we don't have our own think tanks and ways of advertising. 

Some public schools have more freedoms than others, when it comes to sharing American and/or World Literature and History.  We do not all share the same notion of "cultural literacy" and the resulting diversity is considered a positive.
