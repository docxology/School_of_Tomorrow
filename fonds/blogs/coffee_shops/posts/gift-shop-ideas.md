Our troupe met in a favorite Westmoreland HQS, over Philadelphia (aka Quaker City) style steak sandwiches and red style beers.
[Nancy Ankcorn](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/avp-again.html) regaled us with stories of being slythe and alone in Las Vegas that time, hit on left and right by predatory XYs, flattering but also hair-raising (mammals may be dangerous).

Our conversation meandered to casinos from many angles, Jon, a musician, having worked in one on the Utah-Nevada border, some town with a line down Main Street, gambling on the one side only.  He enjoyed the experience (great carpet, flashy slots).

A problem in Oregon today:  the legislature has properly banned the under-aged from dancing in strip joints by amending the law to say if alcohol is served then minors can't be on stage in any performance capacity, immediately killing the symphony and ballet, where many of the stars are well under 21.  That's politics for ya, as smart as a Laplace's mechanical duck (OK, Vaucanson's) and his bogus brief for deterministic reductionism (thinking back to Terry's slides [for Stu Kauffman](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/reinventing-sacred.html) (got me [thinking of The Turk](http://dugnorth.com/blog/labels/The%20Turk.html) beating Napoleon that time)).

Given social networking practices, subversive subcultures will likely take pride in flaunting their patronage register i.e. it's not a "dirty little secret" that you've enjoyed practicing philanthropy at a CSN branch.  On the contrary, that's street cred.  "[Smart people shop here](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/yar.html)" is how we look at it, not unlike the BFI gift shop's attitude (see right margin).

In other news, I'm curious which venue Ewa suggested for the Django conference in September.  She's doing recon for CTE.  I've started work on my OS Bridge slides, outlining some [EduPycon track concepts](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/mapping-gnu-math.html).  A conference goal:  have the presentation machine running Jaunty Jackalope, meaning I need to upgrade from Hardy Heron through Intrepid Ibex.  I'm working on this [over the weekend](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/testing-jackalope.html).
