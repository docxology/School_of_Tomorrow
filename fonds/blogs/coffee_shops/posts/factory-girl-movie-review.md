Andy Warhol fans and detractors already know this story. I was only 
glancingly familiar with most of his work until recently, when Portland 
Art Museum unveiled [a major retrospective](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/01/andy-warhol-exhibit.html).  That helped me tune in more 
of his scene, though I didn't catch the name Edie Sedgwick until last 
night, when I finally saw the dramatization.

My 
thoughts flashed to [Patty Hearst](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/neverland-movie-review.html) a few times, and her relationship with
 her own family. I'm not a know-it-all on these families, just we have a
 lot of windows and telling remarks in the public record, which 
facilitates discussion of celebrities.  Orson Welles comes to mind.

Edie
 was [an heiress](http://www.biography.com/news/famous-heiresses-scandals) from a Santa Barbara ranch family, transplants from 
Boston, East Coasters on the Pacific. Hearst Castle is on the same 
coast.  When I think of Hearst, I often flash on [Homer Davenport](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/12/toontown-revisited.html), his 
lead political cartoonist in some chapters, and native of Silverton, 
Oregon.  I have quite a bit about Homer in my blogs owing to my 
friendship with Gus Frederick, an expert on Homer's life and to some 
extent times.

Edie big dream was to find herself in 
New York and to pioneer a freer way of being alive in a city big enough 
hearted to support such experiments.  She was by all accounts bold, but 
in falling victim to drug abuse, got derailed.  This was the story of a 
generation and has not ceased being the core plot of many scenarios.

Folks
 in my cohort have their own generational window in that I was old 
enough to have Warhol on my radar, but not adult enough to track the 
soap operas.  I uncover the history of my own time in my later years, 
having lived through it in my own day dreamy way, as some kid in Italy 
or whatever.

A lot of work went into making this a real telling. The filmmakers undertake their task seriously. I'm [reminded of Mishima](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/mishima-life-in-four-chapters-movie.html).  In being a dramatization, the script takes many [liberties with the facts](http://edieempire.livejournal.com/1026.html), many of which remain unknown. This movie is but one possible assembly of an intricate jigsaw puzzle.
