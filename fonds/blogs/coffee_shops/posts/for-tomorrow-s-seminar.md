This is a live "teach in" in front of a live audience, whom you'll hear on the laugh track.

I say "laugh track" because that's mostly what they do (laugh); I don't mean to imply a "[laugh track machine](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/mens-fashions.html)" is used.

Fuller has a good sense of timing and gets people chuckling about the darnedest things.

For those of you wishing a little historical context:  the man listening to Bucky was a non-academic practicing philosopher who later gravitated into academia more.  Werner Erhard.  The younger guy is Fuller's grandson.

Erhard had recently discovered Fuller for himself, as another "est person", an idea he'd [lifted from science fiction](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/12/some-storytelling.html).  L. Ron Hubbard is another figure associated with science fiction, but then where does one draw the line, between scifi and myth, fading over into religion.

For tax purposes, if you filed as a religion, you might be tax exempt.  Philosophies could file as nonprofits as well.  The tax law was very complicated.
