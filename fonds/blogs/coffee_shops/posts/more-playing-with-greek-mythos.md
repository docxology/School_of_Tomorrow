Here's a series of billboards you might find interesting, from the Language Project of the 1980s:

Picture:  Earth from space
Caption:  Spaceship

Picture:  Children playing on geodesic dome
Caption:  Wildlife

Picture:  Nautilus Shell
Caption:  High Tech

Picture:  Earth from space
Caption:  Game Park

Then there's my Python billboard with just the Python logo (already well known) and the caption: Just Use It.

"Just Use It" alludes to Nike's "Just Do It".

Nike is a familiar / avatar of goddess Athena, as is the Python.

Leveraging Greek mythology is one of the things I do (in the tradition of Carl Jung et al), such as retelling the story of Apollo and the Python he supposedly slew... the Python escaped actually, and moved to Nashville, where a full scale Parthenon exists with a museum about the original Parthenon (temple to Athena) in the basement.

But I digress.  Did you know of the connection between Athena and West Point?  We're talking about the military again.
