There's something about phi - Chapter 7 - Phi, the enneagram and the platonic solids

[Javier Roma√±ach](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8WATrKPZ3Nhl-dVE9KmrLA)

Chapter 7 of the series "There's something About phi". Video on the number phi, golden number, divine proportion or golden ratio and its relationship with the golden segments. Dedicated to the enneagram, its relation with the platonic solids, and the construction of an unknown figure for me tha I've named as the divertahedron.
