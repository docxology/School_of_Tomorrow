What's a Bizmo?  When a Youtube channel takes the show on the road and starts going places, for real, they might use a bizmo, or even several.  A business mobile takes a crew to the "shoot" i.e. the place where recordings are being made.  A refugee camp for example.

Patrons develop an appreciation for a specific crew and the work it does.  Perhaps the crew specializes in digging wells or providing sanitation for small villages.  Perhaps you have an interest in such work as well.  Your company may sell pumps, digging equipment.  Getting your products on the scene and in use could be a form of advertising for you.

A bizmo crew shows up somewhere and makes an assessment.  They need specific medical supplies.  As a viewer, you're able to learn of their needs, and as a player, you're able to win funds to send their way.  Or donate directly.  It's not like you're compelled to play some biscuit company's computer game to send money to charity.  However, if you're good at the game in question, why not be a hero?
