Sometimes this blog is about "[reveries](https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/smart-bar-lcds.html)" for showing on CSN LCDs.  As you sip your coffee, you might want to let your gaze wander from LCD to LCD.  Some will be showing abstract patterns, geometric information.  That's the kind of thing described here.

"Prying Apart", [a World Game Museum exhibit](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/10/first-stop-on-tour.html), refers to appreciating a small gap in radius between two otherwise identical shapes.  One is a tad smaller, leaving a gap.  We're talking polyhedrons here.

RT = Rhombic Triacontahedron.  That's the zonohedron in question.

Subsequent key frames, to which smoothly transforming scenarios might exist, would be such as:

- "Remember the MITE (and Rite), Aristotle was Right" (space-filling tetrahedra) 
- 2nd and 3rd roots and powers including "surd" symbol: √
- the golden ratio: Φ
- Fee, Fie, Foe, Fum (four submodules of the E module)
- the power rule (relating linear to areal to volumetric growth)
- two spheres (and a thin wall between them)
- a pair of RTs (tiny difference in radius, volumes 5 & 5+)
- an RT of volume 7.5 sharing vertexes with the RD of volume 6
- an RT of ~21.21 embedding the Jitterbug icosahedron (as long diagonals)
- five concentric zonohedra (six counting the cube of volume 3)...
- one of which is the the space-filling RD of volume 6
- the concept of tetravolumes
- T & E modules (RT)
- A & B modules (RD)
- alternative powering models
- scaling by Φ

In other words, we might envision one degree of separation between "minding the gap" (same thing, another alias) and key frames with any of the above labels.  Between key frames:  [tweening frames](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/10/tweening.html).

For those new to this blog, here is where marketing sometimes storyboards "reveries" (LCD screen animations in many cases) for streaming.  Some of these are ["hypertoons"](https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2012/05/hypertoonery.html).
