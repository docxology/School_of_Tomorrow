CSN is looking for ways to [share screen space](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/10/lcd-content.html) with vendors.Come forward with commercials, but [also games](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/cockfight.html), like the ones at your web sites.We're looking to give our customers a way to build identity around buying your products, yes, but also committing some of the proceeds to causes of their own choosing.We're even proposing to reward heroic efforts, as some of these games may be quite puzzling.Finding solutions helps your friends and family.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhPDGPKcw6q53SP6_XroGrwUsI0DUCNplwsFUd5lQ_7P7NwSMS4Uivq-ITCWq2EKRpjGrqj8qG-haBTEBdSsZT4MmJP06_B2yeTNllWDYAJWN73DfhWmWVFDjsBe_kai_5DymcbHH0nmlnd/s1600-h/jody_ahn.jpg)
