I came across this Youtube recently, which some of
you may already know about.  I've linked straight to
where Bucky Fuller was mentioned, as he was given
a copy of The Animate and the Inanimate to review,
a little known work by one William James Sidis.

William and Bucky were both Harvard men, and the
18 year old Fuller had actually been aware of Siddis,
who'd been admitted some years earlier at the tender
age of 11.  You'll  find that story on page 42 in Alec's
book.

Alec credits the Siddis lectures to Harvard's Mathematical
Club for getting Fuller going on his own "4D" arc and
worldline (i.e. meme).  Indeed, when Fuller reads the
Siddis manuscript, he sees the approximate face of
Synergetics (just going to press at that time).

Tibees, the Youtuber, is a serious intellectual scholar,
taking the time and trouble to unearth and read the
early writings of the later famous.  I watched her review
of Neil deGrasse Tyson's PhD thesis this morning as well.Â
