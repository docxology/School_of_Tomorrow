Or you might have one brand in a can, packed in by grad students (grateful to be here).Once you commit to beer, you'll attract a more ornery crowd that wants stuff "on tap" which means casks, refrigeration, a lot of infrastructure.  Just point them to the beer joint down the street with a polite "this is a coffee shop sir and/or mam".On the other hand, we love beer in PDX and if you feel equipped in that regard, don't mind lots of loud people, many of them politicians, then hey, go for it.  Just be aware that Coffee Shops Network is not directly competing with sports taverns, as I've [previously spelled out](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/coffee-shop-philo.html).  We may also allow water pipes, although maybe not in the United States any time soon.Yes, I know "more on" rhymes with "moron" -- get over it.Thx to pirate TC for the images, from his personal collection.  We had lunch under the Bagdad marquee, all seats sold out for Tom Robbins, author of Jitterbug Perfume and other favorites.  "A smile flickered to her lips like a seagull flying out of a bowl of tomato soup" is one of his I remember.
