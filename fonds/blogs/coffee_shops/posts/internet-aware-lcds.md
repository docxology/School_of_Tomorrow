The display above, by [Charles Cossé](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/10/go-by-train.html), runs on a Raspberry Pi.

Connect the Pi to a large display (e.g. HDTV) at your Coffee Shop or Code School, with the right SD card, and you're in business.  Customers enjoy the worldly feel of Internet Awareness.

Other LCDs provide [other reveries](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/smart-bar-lcds.html), such as [Hexagonal Awareness](http://hexagonalawarenessproject.tumblr.com/archive).  The LCDs behind the counter show the current menu.  [Add a mirror](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/magic-mirror/)?

Use Raspberry Pis for all of these HDTVs if you wish.
