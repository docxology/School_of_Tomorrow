:: GI Coffeeshops Tour / PDX ::

Their [bizmo](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/search?q=bizmo) was traveling from San Diego, CA to Everett, WA with many stops in between, to share with the public about the reality and sorrows of empire.

The movie [Sir! No Sir!](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/sir-no-sir-movie-review.html) was mentioned a few times, to help orient a general audience as to where these folks were coming from.

I was a muted presence in a packed meetinghouse, bringing copies of the [Wray Harris](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/11/armistice-day-2012.html) Authority & Expectation DVD to the three coffeeshop owner-representatives, courtesy of Recruiter Watch.

The coffeeshops are / were [Coffee Strong](http://www.coffeestrong.org/) outside [Lewis-McChord](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/07/this-ones-for-you.html) near Tacoma, WA, [Under the Hood](http://underthehoodcafe.org/) in Killeen, Texas, and the [The Clearing Barrel](http://theclearingbarrel.blogspot.com/) coffee bar in Kaiserslautern, Germany.
