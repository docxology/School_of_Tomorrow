[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5524645888/)The movie Nirel has been working on, to be shot in Europe, would likely feature this starlette.  The script is only loosely based on [Nirel's adventures](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/12/nirels-adventures.html).  What's more important, they've hit it off.  "She is a single mom, dancer, martial artist and skates" writes [our CTO](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3486526515/).  I'll save names for later.  I proposed myself as a cameo (maybe many), always wanting to be an extra somehow. [](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2924505381/)
