:: carrotmob, summer solstice ::

It's almost happening! Invite everyone! To all guests of [Carrotmob storms HOTLIPS Pizza!](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=83734994169)

The final push has begun! The event is in only 6 days. Put up lots of posters!

If you still want to volunteer, let me know by Wednesday when you can work (which shift, preferably: 9:30-3 or 3-9). We especially need people with trucks for setting up (9:30-11) and tearing down (7 PM onward).

Also, don't forget to invite all your friends to Carrotmob on Sunday!

Thanks!
Tim
