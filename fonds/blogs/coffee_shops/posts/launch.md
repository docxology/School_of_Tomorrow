:: a fine grind production ::In late 2008, I started branding some works as Fine Grind Productions, named for a local coffee shop, then owned and operating by artist in residence Jody Ahn, with assistance from her capable staff.FGP's first productions were a slideshow about Py3K (Python 3000, a backward incompatible leap into the __future__ by the Python computer language), and a backdrop projection for my debut as a "Dymaxion Clown" at Portland Center Stage ([IEEE lecture, election night, 2008](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/ieee-presentation.html)).The Py3K slides presaged my focus on coffee shops as an outlet for exclusive high definition content, including interactive games [with an eye towards supporting worthy causes](https://wanderers.pbwiki.com/CoffeeShopsNetwork).Our customers themselves are "worthy causes" and our charitable giving games help customers build their profiles, chronicle exploits, even while supplying vendors and potential sponsors with market-relevant analytics.Unlike my others, this blog will exploit AdSense and Adaware technologies.[KU in 2024: the video is lost so I swapped in an apropos Flickr slideshow -- I never went with AdSense or Adaware ]
