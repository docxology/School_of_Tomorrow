Those of you not familiar with Oregon won't know about our Rogue Valley and Rogue Ales, of which we're proud.  There's been some talk lately of Rogue Nation as another name for Oregon, playing off our pirate heritage (Portland a FOSS capital, home of the [Pirate Festival in St. John's](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/yar.html)).In terms of decor, lets go with esoterica, per usual.  As an aspect of foreign policy, I'm focused on Washington, D.C.'s role as a money funnel (aren't we all)?  The sitting Senate in that distant city (not really a part of the Union?) has just approved $30 million for [better air traffic control equipment](http://in.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idINN1231689820090512) in one of the "stans" (Kyrgystan).  What were they thinking?Continuing to [dump fuel](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/save-polar-bears.html) and equipment into that region with no stated goal other than to violate Pakistan's territorial integrity (another invasion!) and suppress religious freedom, while looking for handouts on the international lending circuit seems unsustainable, but that's why [this is fun](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-05/14/content_11373670.htm):  let's watch all [the clowning around](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/bait-and-switch.html), now that the spotlight is on 'em.What will the pundits say?There's not even a Coalition of the Willing this time, just a few scattered think tanks with funny faux thinkers (this should be good).  Remember all that hoopla about Georgia?I've seen the "drone pi√±atas" and think those will work.  I suggest superhero literature scattered around, some [Iron Man comics](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/06/iron-man-movie-review.html) especially.  Popcorn.
