Then we repaired to Bread and Ink, home of the original Hawthorne Fred Meyer's.  I was treated to pan fried oysters and two pints of ESB.I shared more of our plans for world domination, a perennial geek topic, and bragged about my friends, both XX and XY (female and male).  That's what marketing is, a lot of the time, plus picking up on hints, little bits of advice.And now for something completely different, from today's NASA lore [on Phantom Torsos](http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2009/27may_phantomtorso.htm) (used to compare computer models to reality regarding radiation dangers in space), the piece by Pat Rawlings/SAIC:[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgA5iAQsz_IUijoDLH5ZQZvokK-LTlJTshSUwEzIRysFCy7yayW9JJi1MAo1efU1c-utcpycRytTcSq-KFhLQmK6SmYFWXiyBU43mVh11TFVTS4uC2-LranQ3wAK0NurO81kII4gGqLlyZy/s1600-h/DistantShores3.jpg):: distant shores ::
