The edupunk movement uses open source course / curriculum materials as raw input to make these hacked, value added, channel streams.I'm on the lookup for a channel suitable for such as Laughing Horse Books (and video collective):  Obey Giant type material is part of the mixins ([ala Shepard Fairey](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/10/zone-movie-review.html)), plus recycling posters for past and upcoming music events.  A channel needs a good VJ sometimes, someone to break in with allusions and timely reminders.  We're not just running what was stuffed in a can for this time slot, days or weeks back, even though many clips are golden oldie.  The mix gets remixed.I'm not against auto-mixing algorithms as some readers know though.  The hypertoons archive comes with segue / bridge nodes organized by connecting-edge scenarios.  These partially overlapping animations and/or live action streams of consciousness have a seamless quality, especially if tightly crafted to organize a namespace / reality, such as Uru.  Geometry lends itself to teaching by hypertoon, as does Geography (a specific terrain).My sources tend towards cartoon, some circus material.  This relates to the carnival atmosphere of the original geekdom.  There's also the underground comix aspect, the idea of superheros, goddesses, archetypal beings.  Geography + Geometry.  There's also the Martian Math angle, mixed with RBF's bluer lagoon (more Polynesian, with lots of dolphins and mermaids).[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3161817732/)[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3161817732/):: js inspects art book near Remote, Oregon::
