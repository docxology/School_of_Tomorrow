I joined a bunch of Meetups on Meetup.com to ring in the new year, and in so doing found out about the Portland World Game meetup.

The group was staging a "positive protest" (not against anything) that very day, New Year's Day, in the South Park blocks.

I was on a tight schedule so only managed a few shots during 
the setup phase.  I got into a conversation with a guy, only four months
 in Portland, about how prolific Fuller was (the genius behind the World
 Game meme).  Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth was one of his[ more influential titles](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/12/global-data-global-matrix.html).

I pointed to the nearby Arlington Club as where Ed and June Applewhite had stayed, [when visiting Portland](https://flic.kr/p/nJ229A) in the 1990s.  Ed was Fuller's chief collaborator on the two [Synergetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_%28Fuller%29) volumes.  He wrote [Cosmic Fishing](http://www.amazon.com/Cosmic-Fishing-Account-Synergetics-Buckminster/dp/0025027107) to chronicle that experience.
