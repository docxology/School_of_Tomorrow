I was alerted to the above video [by John Driscoll](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/05/architect.html) today, as we met at Lyrik.  We discussed the Sesame Street model as an inspiration for hypertoons, long-running reveries that explore a database of video clips, stitching them together in real time, and/or asynchronously.  Programmers may need to (or wish to) insert local content, interrupting a feed from some distant source.  The Shop's caretakers having mixing powers i.e. editing responsibilities.  What's going on in the neighborhood?  Curious customers want to know.CSN is not about surrendering local control to some imperial center.Given this blog is "prefrequency" in the sense that we're sketching an open source business model, providing the prior art, I'm OK with showcasing "non-commercial use" segments.  When syndicating for the CSN network itself, compensating artists will not be a verboten concept, even though we're a philanthropic organization, a charity, a worthy cause ourselves.  As the chief marketing officer (CMO), I'm not opposed to being rewarded for my architecture (new circuit designs for motherboard Earth), nor for my hypertoons concept.  My thanks to Richard Hawkins for early encouragement along these lines (I entered a contest to win a Sun workstation, didn't win).Dr. Nick has been educating me about [the work of Mark Lakeland](http://www.yesmagazine.org/happiness/building-the-world-we-want-interview-with-mark-lakeman), local activist.  The intersection known as Sunnyside Piazza is due for repairs.  City Repair has scheduled an event for May 29th.  This intersection is not far from Duke's Landing.  Expect some photographs.
