The Golden Ratio will appear in this blog in connection with the so called Quanta Modules (possible name collision with quantum -- disambiguation required), of which the most published about are A, B, S, T, E.  The [Koski Identities](https://repl.it/@kurner/SandE-Modules#main.py) use Phi-Scaled S, E modules especially, to express some common, canonical volumes.
