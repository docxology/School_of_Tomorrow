[ excerpt from Morning Coffee with Kirby in Control Room ] 

What I dream about are specific Coffee Shops that operate openly as 
places you can try various potions, poisons, concoctions, other toxins. 
 Yes, they're modeled on opium dens to some extent, but they're not 
clones of one another either.

Those operating these establishments
 are well trained (in theory at least) and psychologically attuned to 
the needs and wants of their customers, but they're also up on medical 
science.  

These coffee shops may be like a health club in being 
membership based, and like bars in exercising their rights to eighty-six
 specific people, based on their track record.  Like a video rental shop
 (remember those?), they may have a record of customer orders (as do the
 streaming services).  They may be highly regulated.

If you're
 the kind of cowboy who jacks up on some substance, then starts brawls 
on a regular basis, don't be too amazed if your membership fob (or key) 
stops opening doors at specific establishments.  Operators have the 
right to ban access, just as they have the right to ban firearms on 
private premises (like hotels), perhaps checked into a safe or locker 
(retrieve when you check out).
