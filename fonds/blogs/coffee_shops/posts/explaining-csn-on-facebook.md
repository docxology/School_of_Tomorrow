My scheme is to heist "church bingo" to where you go to a bar and play video lottery or any wired arcade game, but your winnings such as they are go to charities the circuit supports. Micro-philanthropy coinciding with moments of heroism. A dopamine rush right when you give in a strategic manner (as time goes on, more strategic). Now these winnings could all be in crypto, and good against specific catalogs... anyway, I brainstorm and open source the circuits. Don't forget to save profile when you donate winnings, as your profile is what builds reputation score, something money can't buy.
