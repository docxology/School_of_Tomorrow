I'll write as if you were...[Grab and install VPython](http://www.vpython.org/) from Carnegie-Mellon or one of those, then grab my hypertoons generator, [deposited at 4Dsolutions](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/hypertoons/) (we're like your memory bank of cool toyz).If you want a podcast to preview, [Synergetics on the Web](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/) has an example (narrated), [or check YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=&search_query=hypertoons+synergetics) for more.[Hypertoons](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/hypertoon.html) are looping animation tracks with a network structure, such that you'll segue differently based on Python's [pseudo-random number generator](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/around-town.html).A hyper-audio track (matching or on its own) would be a logical next feature, feel free to start a project pointing back to its root.  This isn't a visualizer, so don't worry about infringement (not a screen saver either -- wouldn't matter if it were).You'll maybe be able to make your own hypertoons eventually, but for starters this starkly geometric one serves a didactic purpose ([teaches philosophy](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/bio.html)), is family friendly -- is even interactive if your setup allows for controls.You'll need some way to run Python. Maybe [slave an XO](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/saving-children.html) to a ceiling mounted computer projector and shoot against some opposite wall?I've not tried this particular option, am not sure if Vpython runs on an XO-1, plus why waste a perfectly good laptop for such a primitive purpose? Some junker with a gig of RAM oughta do the trick.  [Free Geek](http://www.freegeek.org/) has those by the boat load (thx!).Note: there's a stereo option but you'll need the special "glasses".
