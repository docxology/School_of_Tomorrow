You know me, I'm back to harping on some abstract stuff, wanting to make aesthetics matter.  Today I was talking about Ramanujan saying, in response to [a Medium story](https://medium.com/@sunilsingh_42118/25-years-later-closer-to-home-but-still-not-arriving-in-mathematics-54a598e04757):

Good one, got me thinking of the ballads, plays, sagas and epics that have mathematics in them. I favor bringing in some Ramanujan because now we have arbitrary precision software available (beyond calculators), so why not check out some of his wild convergences to thousands of places?

There's a lot of history (storytelling) behind just how far we can push our algorithms, to how many digits of accuracy. From Al Khwarizmi to Wolfram. 

We may not have proved why a given convergence works (some of Ramanujan's were famously opaque to proof) yet we're free to test them in empirical reality...

You probably know what I'm thinking of right?
