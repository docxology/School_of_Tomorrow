Glenn took me on a tour, showed me the emerging inventory of books and magazines.  These aren't your average boring textbooks, although a few in the mix may help with the alloy, by providing contrasting summary information in academe's fave formats.Nirel, thanks for letting me promote your work through the [OS Bridge slides](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/os-bridge-conference.html), which I went over again with Wanderers [the other morning](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/wanderers-200971.html), glad to have [Lindsey](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/planning-meetings.html) to my left, an accomplished CTO type in her own right.  HB2U BTW, you and [Suzanne](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/10/busy-friday.html) are about the same age.The new owner of the Pauling Campus coffee shop around the corner said OK to my patching in with wireless to blog about [Art's talk](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/wanderers-200977.html).  It's weak but usable and LPH's higher bandwidth wasn't serving for some reason. Said owner was one of the MVPs at Local Lounge [on Friday evening](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/busy-weekend.html).Fine Grind is doing a Japanese circle and [new art opening](http://pdxfinegrind.blogspot.com/2009/07/upcoming-art-show-july-18th.html).  Best wishes on those plans for a deck.
