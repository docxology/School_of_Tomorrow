Joe Clinton opens by reading a lengthy passage by some philosopher, which begins to sound like Bucky in places, but is this text by Joe Clinton himself?  Is Joe into being this metaphysical?  He quotes Bucky internally, so clearly the outer quote is not Bucky. 

Funny how the term "dictate" forces itself into so many discussions of metaphysical rules.  Grammar police.

OK, they're his own words, he's taking credit (these are notes in real time). He addresses his convention of colorizing internal Bucky quotes.

Joe is a big Froebel  fan.

Joe has spent a lot of his time on this Jitterbug Transformation, a centerpiece in Synergetics, a kind of dumbbell dorge if we look at symmetrical expansions to outer limits around a zero center, called a "bow-tie" by Bucky (he used a symbol):
