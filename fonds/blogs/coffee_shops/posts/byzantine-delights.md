Another photographer and I enjoyed this year's Greek Festival here in Portland.Â  I was somewhat "on the clock" as CMO for this Coffee Shops Network, recounting my public appearance at Women's Bookstore where I "came out" as a avatar for the Cult of Athena.

Maybe that sounds impressive but there's always gotta be a cult back stage somewhere and I felt a need to be up front about it, not that we were signing a contract or anything, just a meeting with a candidate new CHR.

Plus it's not like it's a secret to blog readers here or anything, that [Greek mythology](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/greek-mythology.html) is involved, just CSN is esoteric and behind the scenes so I have my work cut out for myself, in making the charitable enterprise more transparent to folks.
