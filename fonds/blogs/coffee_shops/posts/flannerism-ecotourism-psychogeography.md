As a Wanderer, a group based at the Linus Pauling House in Portland, Oregon, I'm hip to these quotes from Benoit Mandelbrot:

Early on, I became a wanderer-by-choice between the disciplines, and between theory and applications. Electing to live as a constant maverick, I allowed my interests to move in and out of mathematics, in and out of physics, of economics, or diverse other fields of physical and social sciences, and even music and art.
Science would be ruined if it were to withdraw entirely into narrowly defined specialties. The rare scholars who are wanderers-by-choice are essential to the intellectual welfare of the settled disciplines.
The links to urban exploration make sense of you think of the psychogeography of the mind, a territory mapped by mnemonics, memetics and the Hermetic tradition.

The "ecotourist" of the 21st Century is often on "tours of duty" meaning there's work involved, and academic credit.  The site will have organized around a steady flow of part time volunteers (you choose you duties in a competitive environment).

Where does the charity come from i.e. the funding?  That's what Coffee Shops Network is all about: giving Everyman the tools to practice philanthropy.  Your reputation as a savvy grant giver, based on winnings, is worth cultivating.  You'll become a role model for imitators.

Will Self, a British novelist and sometime TV personality speaks about psychogeography in some of his Youtubes.  He's also a big fan of the Russian science fiction movie Solaris by Andrei Tarkovsky.
