From a followup email to someone I met at a conference (one typo fixed):

Thanks for getting back to me.  

We were at the same table is all, and I have your business card.  

Your
 ideas intrigued me as I've been brainstorming a funding network based 
on people playing games (like in an arcade / casino) but with the 
winnings going to player-picked causes / charities and updating a 
profile.  Some if not all the money to play and pay out rewards may come
 from the sponsors and vendors the shop deals with.  Buy a donut, win a game, send a dollar to the World Wild Life Fund from the donut company.
