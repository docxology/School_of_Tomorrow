David Koski just returned from a grueling work assignment in Illinois -- lots of car troubles, hospital for burns (scalding liquid).  Now he's back at his geometry again, contributing his abilities based on years of practice.  This is [his first screen cast](http://groups.google.com/group/r-buckminster-fuller-synergetic-geometry/browse_thread/thread/19a469548ef917be) of vZome in action, via the free [Screencast-o-matic service](http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cXljiXvlu).  Here's a [longer tutorial](http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/cXlj6JvIc).
