Koski using vZomeWell, I was encouraged by Scott Vothmann to try again on the great rhombicuboctahedron.I didn't exactly succeed but did generate this 132 sided rhombic form. It has 48 squares and 24 (60,120) rhombi and the three other rhombi I have not identified yet. 12 of the fattest one, 24 each of the ones that make the eight pointed stars.I figured the form out by using the Parallel Projection Process.  Vorthmann's vZome has a root 2 system which has 24 brown strut positions or 12 different axes.So, 12*11 will be the amount of rhombic faces of which there are five different types. Therefore, 12/1*11/2*10/3 = 220 total hexahedral cells.Yes, those are flat hexagons and there are 4 zero volume hexahedra that correspond to them.Amounts of different hexahedra will soon follow.BTW, The late Russell Towle refers to the Archimedean Truncated Cuboctahedron (s/b Great Rhombicuboctahedron?) on this page:[http://home.inreach.com/rtowle/Zonohedra/zonohedra.html](http://home.inreach.com/rtowle/Zonohedra/zonohedra.html)  scroll down to middle of pageHe calls it A Notorious Zonohedron, does anyone know why?Is this shape cataloged anywhere, I would like to find more out about it.ThanksDavid KoskiMinneapolis  MNFollowup to PolyList:  I made a mistake.  There are not 48 squares, but they are rhombi of course.  David Koski
