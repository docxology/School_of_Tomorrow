People don't want to re-invent the wheel at every turn and have a well-developed practice of passing libraries back and forth, value adding, developing a common set of tools. This doesn't keep our coder girls from competing with one another, just the shared library levels the playing field plus heightens the level of play, so everyone wins, even if sometimes one loses.The OpenGL type stuff I've been yakking up with my students is capable of driving the 4D video games I've been marketing.  4D in this namespace means "friendly to the enterprising of Bucky Fuller", who tended to brand his work 4D, with sound mathematical reasons for doing so.My [4D Solutions](http://www.4dsolutions.net/) has developed additional resources in this same area, but mostly in the form of "cave paintings" (defined more [on edu-sig](http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig/) at Python.org).  Full scale FOSS libraries develop within communities of co-developers, using tools such as Mercurial and Git.  Some of our philanthropic games will derive from this work.[4D IVM](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/synergetica.html) and 3D XYZ have a lot in common, with the latter dominating in the 1970s, defining a signature rectilinear look.  You'll recognize [4D](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/glass-bead-game.html) from its signature space frame, the octahedron-tetrahedron truss (the long winded name for it).[Stacked fruit](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/sphpack.html) is a typical hallmark, both triangular and square based.  Also watch for [Morley's Theorem](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s01/figs/f0051.html) to crop up here and there.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiFogxbsHhg2UFNraipGrMkzi2J0ql37KbKuUtF-xci3Q0iuv88uRACkFLSTsH9BUnWGF9qkjzOasQqKcBf9iZU0v7LkGVTsDmwI4O2Wu5w_1kscqUb1QpOtL6BvgQWsKaAYolf-rlRbZ0r/s1600-h/pythonlogotiny.png)
