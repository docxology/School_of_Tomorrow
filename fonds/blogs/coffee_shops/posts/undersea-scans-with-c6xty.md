With the close of Lattice Gallery, right behind Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA), came the end of Phase I:  public awareness.  The press release to the Sculptors Conference net us a key audience, and a footprint in Art World at last.

However, Phase II is likely to focus on marine biology in some dimension, with neutral buoyancy sensors held in stasis by slender "stalks" per the famous Lanahan Flextegrity design -- what Lattice Gallery was all about.  Marine Habitats.  Ecotourism.  What's down there?

How do we address CCP lattice balls uniquely?  Why not use coordinate addresses.  The stalks have sufficient diameter to carry insulated cable.  We don't have to use 5G or even 4G, thereby interfering with signal.  We'll have an underwater matrix able to sense schools of fish, unaffected by the cabling, and render them in 3D in real time.

Some of you may be imagining a much more spaced-out matrix with room for larger objects, pre-programmed to dodge nodes (hubs) and stalks (connectors).

Better yet, we're free to communicate on public frequencies, i.e. use WiFi so 5G or 4G might be just the ticket.

The underwater buoy matrix, in CCP conformation, will depend on C6XTY-like buckyballs (macro-sized) holding their own positions.  This might require battery power only for the duration of the tournament or other sporting event.  Think of drones, but underwater.

Have you seen our technical journaling about (a,b,c,0) addressing for these pods?  Popular mechanical engineering themes weave through this (x,y,z) fabric of lattice elements.  Do we call it Cartesian?  Our high schoolers start to study these topics well before students in most states (of mind). Would you like to accelerate along a learning curve?

I'm looking to India and other ancient cultures for some feedback on this question, regarding the IVM as an archetype.  What's[ the etymology of "isotropic"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/isotropic) in ancient Greek?  Do we find the IVM in the Vedas in some precursor form?  Some Buddhist have said it means Void (in translation).  That sounds fine, but let's not wait for someone in California to figure it all out, OK?  Oregon Curriculum Network has more direct sources.

IVM has many meanings of course, as my PhD friend Dr. Potkin reminds me.  Of course this being CSN, home of those synergetics hypertoons, I'm using the namespace of Dr. Fuller:  isotropic vector matrix.

That's the CCP (or FCC) to you chem heads (Linus Pauling's preferred stomping ground).  Check OCN's stash of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/Generating%20the%20FCC.ipynb) for more info ([School of Tomorrow](https://github.com/4dsolutions/School_of_Tomorrow) meme).
