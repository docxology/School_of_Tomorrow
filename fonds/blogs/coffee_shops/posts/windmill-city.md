CSN was developed in a dark age when we didn't yet share with kids about the Concentric Hierarchy and its whole number volumes.

Most of the "adults" in that time had shelved it and were planning to keep it under wraps in perpetuity.

Of course that plan was bound to fail, and by 2018 a lot of us are seeing a lot more of this stuff on our LCDs and HDTVs.

YMMV.
