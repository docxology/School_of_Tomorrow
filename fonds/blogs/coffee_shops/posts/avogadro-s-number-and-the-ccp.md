I'm going to take you to an old blog post (archival) in case you have an interest in this topic: [Avogadro's Number](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/avogadros-number.html).

American Literature replaced the BCC and SCP with the CCP in Transcendentalism, when representing "the holodeck" (archetype: land before time, firmament, matrix) before some schools of engineering even knew what that meant (not being crystallographers by training).

In review ([OCN stuff](http://4dsolutions.net/ocn/xtals101.html)):

- BCC: body centered cubic
- SCP:  simple cubic
- CCP:  cubic close packing

At CSN, we're into providing the best in "[STEM reveries](https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2018/11/another-reverie.html)" meaning as you cram for that exam, over coffee, just staring into space, at one of our LCDs, may get you remembering Organic Chemistry.

We're not limited to "STEM reveries" by legal contract or deal, just that's an area of weakness in some Coffee Shops, which may tend to cater more to idle tourists or flaneurs as some prefer.

Hard-working eco-tourists are a different category entirely (not idle, for one thing).
