"Finally, we're not killing anyone" -- what a feeling of liberation!Yet we still had the best toyz, and even civilians could play.  We needn't invite such disasters, we're surrounded by such challenges.  On with the circus then![](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3397647579/)Thanks to Green Room / Ops for a great Pycon by the way, and special thanks to our CSN CTO in Malibu for [Operation Polar Bear](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/operations.html) (ongoing).Also: way to go Denver Airport:[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3398295378/):: global warming is real ::(click for Photostream context)
