I understand how math teachers get defensive, about how their curriculum is already packed with topics.  Bringing back hexadecimals is bad enough, but introducing a whole different approach to the polyhedra... that's not what they signed up for.

I keep reassuring them:  don't you worry, this is for humanities people to understand. We'll work it out on the PATH side, and the STEM folks will visit, more as tourists.  Welcome to someplace alien.
