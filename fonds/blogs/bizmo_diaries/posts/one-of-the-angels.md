On Thursday, December 8, 2022 at 10:37 PM EST, Christopher John “CJ” 
Fearnley, passed away from a very aggressive, still undiagnosed cancer. 
CJ was 55 years young. He is survived by his partner Jeannie, two 
sister’s Michele and Brenda, his mother Marilyn, father Jack and 
stepmother Edyta, and two nephews Ryan and Nick. CJ was born in NY. CJ 
was a Comprehensivist and Explorer in Universe.

In my own experience, CJ was a great inspiration and collaborator, whether it was a deep exploration
 into Bucky Fuller, synergetic geometry,  philosophy, Dante, Dostoevsky,
 Saramago or Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN, our last deep read. He had a 
reading plan that extended years into the future.  In recent months, as 
he refined his ideas about the need for comprehensivity, he encouraged 
all to be macro-comprehensive and micro-incisive.

CJ was one of the angles.
