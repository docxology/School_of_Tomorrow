:: Fall Look ::

High winds today, trees bending, quite stormy but without the driving rain.  I was walking in it no problem, descending Mt. Tabor.

It was mini boom town in Stump Town in those years, with many a new palace, new bridge (making a dozen total).  A proud city approximately at the end of both [the Oregon Trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail) (pioneered by Lewis & Clark) and the [Missoula Floods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula_Floods) (in different chapters obviously).

The last Dick Pugh talk I missed wasn't [content I'd heard](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/02/cosmic-consciousness.html) i.e. I missed out on quite a good talk by all accounts.  I'd been [moping in my beer](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/10/failings.html) contemplating a different fashion line up now that ol' Stetson Gun Club was gone for good.  Longmire without a hat?

The Punch & Judy Show at Math Forum has been productive for me at least in that I got in touch with a GST buddy in India, a pen pal if you will, who knows more about [Warfield and Pearce](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9628831) than I do.  We've had our differences, which I've [even blogged about](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/09/ppug-2014924-ongoing-threads.html), but that only shows how much we care.  Awww...

This really happened:  I saw [The Zero Theorem](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-zero-theorem-movie-review.html) twice and the second time my RAZR decided it needed a red vortex splash screen and gave itself one.  A first perturbation of the Singularity?  Smartphones might start showing signs first, like dogs yelping before the tsunami.
