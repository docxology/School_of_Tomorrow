 Thank you to Laurie and Terry for hosting their wonderful Hanukkah party, to which we've been invited over the years.

Carol was able to join us this time, a first.

Season's Greetings to readers of these Grain of Sand blogs.

Here's a toast (a nod with nog) in your general direction (with eye contact if feasible).

Thanks to all.  Merry wishes to sentient beings.

Wishing you well in 2013.

A shout out to Bill Lightfoot who showed up for a good dinner at The Bagdad.

Love, Kirby

@ Greater Trumps (in good company)
