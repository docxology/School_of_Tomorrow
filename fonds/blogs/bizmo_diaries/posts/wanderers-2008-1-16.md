I was late, as usual on Wednesday mornings, so missed seeing Patrick, another busy bee (and new fan of our snake).Speaking of vital topics, Tara did this beautiful analogy between a cell (the DNA kind) and an ant hill. She actually knows quite a bit about ants from previous research, so her analogy was as much about ants as about cells -- quite detailed in both directions.I was impressed.This cell analogy project is a longstanding part of 8th grade culture at Winterhaven. I'd say Tara has adapted to this culture very successfully.Had to run off to test the [new web cam](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/show-tell.html), on a bad hair day (just got it cut (I'm sure it'll grow on me)).
