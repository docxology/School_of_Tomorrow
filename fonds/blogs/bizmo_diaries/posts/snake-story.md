[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3949121234/)The news broke on Twitter about [@psf_snake](http://www.twitter.com/psf_snake) having a baby (another one? -- I don't really know all the details); I posted to PSF-members about it.  JKM ([the real one](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/09/django-conference-day-1.html)) bawled me out for putting human interest fluff all over his front page (he has a newspapery background). I'm getting away with [a more textbooky approach](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-September/009546.html) on [edu-sig](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig), building up my rep as "[the NATO professor](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/nato-professor.html)".Yes, she flunked diversity training (we're hoping to keep that secret), mostly for saying bad words, talking trash.  This is no pampered richie rich snake, works for a living, grew up on the wrong side of the tracks as they say, maybe in a trailer park like I did for awhile, in Florida.Speaking of Florida, that might be where she met the father, or at least she'd obviously been there.  To quote one of her tweets (Sept 5 of this year):Reminiscing.... after a big meal: [http://tinyurl.com/lgjjyr](http://tinyurl.com/lgjjyr) (famous!). Nice man holding my tail (Florida vacation) [http://tinyurl.com/mccmr8](http://tinyurl.com/mccmr8) Her baby boy, Adonis (pronounced Adūnīs, per the [Lebanese poet](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/516535/Adonis), although many people forget that) is happily nursing, [pythonic](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/pythonic-means-pithy.html) breast feeding made possible by inheriting from the Mammal class as well as the Reptile class (multiple inheritance).  Python is not English remember, so our respective grammars definitely diverge ([per Wittgenstein](http://groups.google.com/group/Wittrs/browse_thread/thread/c7d3623799cf2cef?hl=en#)).For those of you who think an artificial intelligence can't tweet or blog, I assure you AI bots do both and much more.  The Sony Aibo was a bold beginning in this regard.  It doesn't take a positronic brain (per Asimov) to give better counseling than [ELIZA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatterbot), so think twice before you brand this just another hoax.Adonis is bonding [with Lindsey](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/09/equinox-retreat.html) (the midwife), so will probably stay in Portland once weaned. We expect he'll become a valued and contributing member of our community (good genes -- or are these [memes](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/meme-campaign.html)?).
