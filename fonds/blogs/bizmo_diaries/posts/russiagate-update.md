[Jimmy] Dore's view is "yes Russians 
troll, so does everyone doing net stuff" and to gain a following you 
start dealing in juicy memes, becoming one of the thought leaders somehow 
(who knows how, that's where the "research" comes in; Cambridge 
Analytica had their OCEAN etc.). 

Then when you have a following you can 
spam them for business reasons i.e. sell advertising (turn around to 
companies and say "you pay me and I'll tell my following about your 
thing"). 

Whereas DNCers see Internet Research Agency dealing in 
political memes with an agenda to tip the election, the Dore crowd see 
"business as usual" where oligarchy is concerned, and which the Russian 
mafia plays along with everybody else, with more interest in getting or 
staying rich than in trying to directly play "king of the White House" 
(just be sure you have some access once the slug fest is over -- what an
 embassy is for). 

That's pretty much my view too: there's no need to 
risk exposure (e.g. FBI detection) hacking federal elections machinery, 
when social media already provide a legal means to play mind games with 
the public. 

I believe Russians [actively engage in social media](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/polysci-a-look-back-at-russiagate-b34e08bb9383), most 
definitely, and echo the DNI report in saying RT is up on its game.
