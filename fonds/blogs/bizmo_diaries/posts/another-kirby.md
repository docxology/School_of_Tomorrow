I'm not saying I don't see similarities, in that we're both pink and round, and I can be something of a demon in the kitchen, occasionally breaking things (Selma could tell you).

However, we should allow that's Kirby's strategy, above, of unifying opposites, is the time-tested remedy of alchemists.  Maybe he stayed a little on the too hyper side, but then it's easy to second guess from the sidelines.
