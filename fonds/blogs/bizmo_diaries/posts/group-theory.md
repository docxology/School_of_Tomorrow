Now someone with a pet peeve might decry my use of "number theory" in the linked/archived post ([link](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4866533)), as I'm speaking of brightly colored polyhedra, twisting about under various camera lights (like in [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/)), with permutations to match.  Matrices get into the act.  But where's the "number theory" here?  "Isn't this all group theory then?" (quivering chin, indignation) .Ah, but there's a hidden bridge, like in Uru.  Twixt group theory and number theory we have these little groups and fields modulo N.  Extract the totients of a number (if prime, it'll be everyone lower -- real [prima donnas](http://www.bartleby.com/59/4/primadonna.html) those primes), and intermultiply them modulo that number.  Woah hoah: those little doggies got Closure, Associative, Inverts, and Neutrality (CAIN -- [some Biblical allusion](http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/cain.html) I didn't invent (got it from a colleague)).  And if modulus N is a prima donna (a prime), then throw in addition, and you've got CAIN in two operators, plus a distributive principle, a little [Galois](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galois.html) field (I hear he was a chick magnet -- unconfirmed), suitable for study by [elementary school students](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/flash/group.html).So that was coming back over the bridge, from number theory ([totatives](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/Jlang.html#5) are the positive integers relatively prime to N, but smaller i.e. no in-common factors but 1 -- a number's totient, an attribute, is "how many" of said totatives it has (if p is prime, phi(p) == p-1 (this phi, which I've seen attributed to [Euler](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/rsa-using-pythonic-notation.html), is a name collision with the golden mean, another meaning for the same lowercase greek letter))).There's another pun lurking here, again not my invention:  CAIN reminds us of Abel in the Bible, and a pioneer of group theory is [Abel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel), such that if you not only have Associativity (a(bc)=(ab)c), but Commutativity as well (ab == ba), then your group is described as Abelian.  The maths are full of such jokes, which is why the hackers' [Gnu Math](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/gnu-math-on-synergeo.html) is such a good fit.  We get one anothers' jokes, sometimes at least.
