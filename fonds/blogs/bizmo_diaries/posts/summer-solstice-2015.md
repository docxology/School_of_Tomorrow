We enjoyed our traditional Solstice Potluck at the Linus Pauling House. Â We've celebrated solstices and equinoxes, sometimes in other locations. 

Friday was not truly the solstice, but we always choose a Friday for logistical reasons.

On Saturday, Glenn and I wandered downtown to visit MercyCorps, which has a walk-in exhibit these days, of their various engineering solutions aimed at helping refugees from disasters, who number well over six million worldwide. 

I mentioned my dream of having [local houseless participate in prototyping scenarios](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/05/disaster-relief.html) using a collaborative model, nothing imposed.

We then visited Kell's Irish Pub for Kell's IPA and some World Cup, soccer for women, Germany versus Sweden.

Ordinarily I would have a lot of pictures to go with this narrative, but the Fujifilm XQ-1 is in the shop and the phone ran out of charge around the time I was ready to use it.
