[Kirby Urner](https://www.facebook.com/thekirbster) As a clue to my political views, I'd like to assist a class of globally-minded trucker establish a route-swap service that launches them to higher status as citizen diplomats. Truck stops around the world will be the place to go for podcasts of great debates. I don't know any other science fiction author working as directly on this story (parallel universe), however the components needed for my narrative to materialize are all out there. I'm not waiting for any breakthroughs in technology, nor interventions from ETs. Either might happen, I just wasn't waiting.

I've been studying WW2 again and see Hilter spared Britain because he found the British adorable (me too) and wanted to split the world with them, not wipe them out. A lot of his military advisers knew hesitancy and all out war are incompatible, but then Hitler saw himself more in the hearts and minds business; he was hoping to win with propaganda. His court psychologists were promising the moon at the time.

An eye-opener awhile ago was Dr. Seuss's role, as an American propagandist (an effective one I'm told, right up there with Charlie Chaplin). More recently, I've been back to Disney's role during wartime: the army was poised to seize his frivolous and inessential cartoon studios, but he convinced the military the rank and file would respond to cartoons, let Donald Duck star in training films.

Even more seriously, Disney adapted a military strategy book about projecting air power, and turned it into an animation, narrated by the book's author. The story is Churchill saw it first, convinced Roosevelt to watch it, and a new approach to war in the Pacific was developed. I'm no West Point academy grad, so correct me at will on the details of this narrative.

[Kirby Urner](https://www.facebook.com/thekirbster) What Jim Henson and Walt Disney had so much in common was their fervent belief that their media (puppets and cartoons respectively) were NOT repeat NOT just for kids. They both wanted to break into the adult world big time with their forms of art. Looking back, I'd agree that stereotyping these media to "children and childhood" was a mostly Brit Victorian invention (where a lot of the "childhood" concepts come from -- not being critical, a great invention).
