Tara successfully burned an ISO of Ubuntu 8.04 and wiped her Gutsy Gibbon off the face of her hard drive.  That gave her the confidence to try again with a more recent 32-bit LTS ISO from her workstation upstairs (overlooking the deck).  She reported this morning that all was working, though the Flash plugin that started it all (not having one) still needed to go on.Chairman Steve was over during the latter part of this.  I called it an "[install mitzvah](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/08/pug-97214-launch-event.html)" again, even though this wasn't specifically Python.  We sat in the office but didn't use Wifi for much, as Tara was getting that 700 MB ISO.  At Open Bastion, download times would be significantly shorter.No update about Eve in awhile, I need to call Uncle Bill.A lot of architects failed to anticipate that making video would be as critical as watching it, so that "media room" really should have been designed with cameras in mind.  On the other hand, given how small the cameras, retro-fitting is hardly a problem if there's budget, and is what many have already done.Given the gaping hole in my ceiling (beneath the deck) owing to previous architectural mistakes, upgrading the office would be my opportunity to show off [home studio concepts](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/gst-and-nonprofits.html).  People could interview here, or serve news.  Granted:  the basement is already sourcing some "[guerrilla girl](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6414140823/in/photostream)" pilots, but less primitivist aesthetics should also be within range, more blue screeny / weather forecasty (lots of global data streams to patch into, syndicated to home studios everywhere).I'm taking a vacation from Synergeo until 2012, putting more thought into Koski's list instead. We're having some interesting threads, about tensegrity and so on.Upcoming [OPDX](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/city-as-campus.html) meetup (check [Calagator](http://calagator.org/) for others):PEACE BRIGADES INTERNATIONAL 30th ANNIVERSARY EVENTFriday, December 2; 6:30 p.m.Multnomah Friends Meeting House4312 SE Stark Street
