Although I'd not yet seen her work, Vi must have been talking to the same muses, when I started my [McLuhanesque rant](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/quotable-quotes.html) against [math teaching at low bandwidth](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/boosting-bandwidth.html).

The above specimen of higher bandwidth teaching (than most chalk 'n talk) is especially representative in that it's bursting at the seams with ideas, hardly able to keep the snakes out, or in as the case may be.

The questioning of standard notations leads to an even deeper questioning of authority, an irreverence, the atmosphere of breakthroughs.

At around 5:30 into it she's galumphing happily through Synergetics territory, giving the same lecture I might about [triangling versus squaring](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/10/multiplication.html). 

This is not only high bandwidth, it's [close to home](http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Wittrs/conversations/topics/7670). Â Hooray for Youtube and Vi.
