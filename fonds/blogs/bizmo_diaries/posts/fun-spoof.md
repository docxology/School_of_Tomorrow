This School of Rock idea is an old one, but it helps to get a refresher course every now and then.There's lots of cross-traffic between "[rock star](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/isepp-lecture-end-of-season.html)" and "[clown](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3012455546/)" (in terms of face paint and getup) and so, more vicariously, "[geek](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/06/pro-python-propaganda.html)" (a carnival attraction).
