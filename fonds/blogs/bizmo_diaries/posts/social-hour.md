Refreshed from yesterday's lengthy bike loop out to Troutdale airport, I showed up at meeting rarin' to go.  Spoken ministry was a pleasure (kept my own trap shut), and I ended up giving more than my usual to the contributions box as a result.Thank you, Janet, for agreeing to fix Dawn's dragon pillow (she made them for Dawn's new office, later [Portland Knowledge Lab](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/playing-with-blocks.html)).  Hi Laten, if you see this sometime.Per conversations with MMM's [CP](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/childrens-program.html) coordinator Kathy Hyzy (Lithuanian name?) , we're likely to move our attendance back to Stark Street more religiously, given Tara's new found friendships at the WQM level.This is the [meeting house](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/festive-outfit.html) I grew up in, post Chicago, pre Rome.  I like the @ home feel, compared to Portland French, which is nevertheless a good fit for us, at least in the interim, and in this early chapter of being a Monthly Meeting (Bridge City only recently became one).Larry, one of my bike mates yesterday, wondered if I still had copies of Idiocracy to share, which I do (a whole stack).  It's a spoof on illiberal culture, wherein anything considered "smart" is considered "pompous and faggy" (anyway, go see the movie, don't let me spoil it for ya).  Shades of [Jim Gaffigan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gaffigan).
