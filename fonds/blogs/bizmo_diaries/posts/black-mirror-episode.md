Magnitsky died in a
 Russian prison being held on charges relating to working for this UK 
oligarch who was originally Putin's fan but later claims to be his 
greatest enemy. We all heard a lot about Magnitsky when that famous 
Trump Tower meeting with the Russian 
lobbyist occurred. She was not there to talk dirt on Hillary and 
everyone got super bored, as oligarch squabbles over big money and 
reputation backstabbing are too ordinary in those circles, where 
syndicates demonize one another incessantly (Hollywood is more friendly?
  Maybe all that Scientology is working for some?).Browder
 says his lawyer was clubbed to death while chained to his death bed in 
prison, by the very people Magnitsky was accusing of financial fraud, as
 Browder's legal representative, or lawyer.  But then there's a 
counter-narrative which is what makes this a rabbit hole, somewhat by 
definition (a vortex of contesting stories converging towards the same 
truths).We heard about Browder again when Putin and
 Trump met in privacy in Helsinki and Putin offered to help out with the
 Mueller indictment of the GRU guys, in exchange for some interviews 
with Browder.  No one would be in custody or under immediate threat of 
extradition.  Maybe I'm wrong about the details of Putin's 
statesman-like offer (there's a treaty about nations giving each other 
mutual support in criminal investigations), as I was not privy to the 
meeting and back then had not yet connected the dots between Browder and
 Magnitsky.  Trump comes out of the meeting saying this could work, 
probably knowing less about Browder (or Magnitsky) than I do at this 
point.  Too boring.  But he's soon told that Browder is Putin's number 
one foe and it all clicks into place.  Who knows.Anyway,
 fascinating stuff.  The Magnitsky Act sails through Congress on the 
basis of this compelling testimony from Browder, and becomes the 
convenient hammer, the justification needed, to turn the screws 
everywhere on the Axis of Evil, always shifting (remember BRIC?), based 
on whatever the public will believe. The public is infinitely gullible 
and has rarely applied the brakes.  Now that more of the public is being
 coerced into homelessness and unforgiving debt, the political model is 
to drop them from the unemployment roles and make counting their votes 
harder, as your tent on the sidewalk is not a registered voter address, 
by definition.  Problem solved re that democracy business, a pipe dream.
  Back to the oligarch infighting channel, the one we most love to 
sponsor.
