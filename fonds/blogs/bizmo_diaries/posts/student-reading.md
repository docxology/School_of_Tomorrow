At the university level, we might introduce tetravolumes in a philosophy of mathematics class, as a good example of how different language games suggest different axioms. 

Imagine a tribe in which multiplication were presented differently. That's hard to "imagine" without some concrete example. This Tropical Math YT is the precursor to using three poles, say X, Y and Z. but no longer mutually perpendicular. 

Non-Euclidean geometries have already legitimized branching away from Mother Goose Math into alternative territory. This might also be an Art History class where we look at Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art.

Remember, the meaning of '4D' depends on the namespace:

- 4D as Time: time machine physics ala Einstein / Minkowski
- 4D as Spatial in nD Euclidean Geometry: polytope math ala H.S.M. Coxeter
- 4D
 as primitively Four Directional (tetrahedron = 4 arrow heads) in 
pre-Frequency a priori res extensa (American Transcendentalist with 
Lakota influence)Â  

On a plane (plain), we divide the unit circle into four quadrants with reference to the four compass directions.

In zero-G space (an ideal conceptualization) we have four directions of the tetrahedron and the four quadrants of space, per [IVM "caltrop" coordinate system](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/thinking-outside-the-box-dcdd9df4ba69) (so "4D" in the [Lakota medicine wheel](http://wearewildness.com/four-directions-medicine-wheel-affect-life/) sense).

For hexahedronists, it's the three-also-six directions of the cube that make the six-spoked XYZ "jack" (so in the XYZ namespace we say space is "3D").
