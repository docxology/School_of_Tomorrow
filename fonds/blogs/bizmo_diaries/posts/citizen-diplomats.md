Tara and I met with Betsey today, in Vancouver, Washington (McMenamins).  On the agenda:  a delegation to Nicaragua.Later we found out that the SE side Passport Office is not where Google says it is.  The guy behind the desk assured us they'd contacted everyone they could think of about the misinformation. Welcome to government, where record keeping is hard to keep up with, even if working at the speed of light.Good to catch up with Betsey, one of Tara's "Quaker aunts".Welcome to Portland, Colin.I'm finally getting [back in the saddle](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/onward-fnb.html) with FNB and the Multnomah Friends Meetinghouse.
