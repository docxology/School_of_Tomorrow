[](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/640/normal_13680.jpg) Oswego 2003I've just been perusing a [photo-blog](http://www.looknfeel.com/photoblog/index.php?cat=2) chronicling the [SNEC Summer Workshop](http://snec.cjfearnley.com/snec.meeting.2003.06.html) in Oswego, New York, June, 2003.  The ever-wandering Nick Consoletti, PhD attended the Tensegrity Structures workshop (also at SUNY Oswego) the following summer. Joe Clinton and John Belt were principals at both workshops.These are the kinds of events I'd want control rooms to route my bizmo through (also to the [Bridges](http://www.sckans.edu/%7Ebridges/) and [Bioneers](http://www.bioneers.org/) conferences, to which I've never been).
