Drones, er, quadcopters, were a big hit this year, [like at OSCON](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/07/oscon-xv.html).

Controlling a quadcopter from within Minecraft, using Python on a Raspberry Py (alternate spelling):  that was a theme on the education track.  The whole Python + Minecraft thing is fun with or without the quadcopter element.

Judging from video clips, kids loved the event, as did their parents and teachers, including mentors from Bank of America, an event sponsor.

Don't have a Raspberry Pi but want to play with Python bindings anyway?  Lost Bear Labs has [a solution](http://blog.lostbearlabs.com/2013/04/25/using-the-minecraft-api-without-a-raspberry-pi-craftbukkit-and-raspberryjuice/) you might try.
