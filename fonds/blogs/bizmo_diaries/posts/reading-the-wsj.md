I started an NFL style [debate on Facebook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6776273258/in/photostream) regarding the moral fiber of granola eating geezers and so on (neoliberals an easy target, as were neocons, which few admit to being since their [undermining of the presidency](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/01/more-geopolitics.html)).

One of the nuke plants in Iran is getting more focus while the others (same grid for all intents) are whirring away under the radar, replenishing illegal weapons stocks and/or just doing their civilian jobs.  No I'm not talking about North Korea.  The IAEA clearly needs help though, especially in India where nationalism remains a leading [mental disease](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7668593&tstart=0) (a complex).

I'm not sure how much of Iran's 20% pure is slated for space program uses.  Civilian nuke plants on the Moon, tiny ones that might be removed, are less likely than in the orbiting accommodations for space tourists and researchers.  The dangers are similar to those with submarines, as tainting the oceans with nuclear waste would be equally irresponsible and BP-like. 

I expect there's some serious mole power in the IAEA, given the training and heritage, even though the leadership appears bought and paid for (perhaps The Guardian has a story -- on my list).  The made-for-TV version might start in Colorado, some kind of NORAD place, where the anti-human stockpiles are tracked, as are their ant-like minions.

Scott Ritter and/or [Muhammad Ali](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/fire-and-ice-korean-war-movie-review.html) could serve as personas to draw from, if you're in screen writing.  The weapons inspector plays [a more heroic role](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/11/hurt-locker-movie-review.html) these days, thanks to nuke weapons having [lost all PR value](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/countdown-to-zero-game.html).  Only stinkers cherish them.

[The "nuclear club"](http://www.4dsolutions.net/mycartoons/cartoon3.html) is for the wretched of the Earth -- so it's somewhat surprising that India is pounding at the door, its pride wounded for not being among the morally reprobate.  The stuff of [comedy and spoof](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/arabs-gone-wild.html).  At least Iran has [a sense of decorum](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/psy-war-whos-losing.html), reminding the world of a possible future, one of zero tolerance for weapons of mass suicide.  Religions that preach the opposite, like Christianity by the looks of things, is too Jonestown-like for my taste.  Humans weren't meant to be so aberrational in that way -- seems unnaturally violent and perverse.

Enslaved humans, trapped in a criminal underground, serving Dr. Evil types as they develop their "systems" for monied sociopaths, is the stuff of melodrama for sure.  Cigars and whiskey, 007, hookahs... the movies could be boringly formula in no time, all adopting a predictably retro look as we move more assets to Havana and/or to Portland with [its retro theaters](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/02/yacoubian-building-movie-review.html).

We get the WSJ at Blue House, a physical paper wrapped in plastic.  I took it to breakfast this morning.

The headline was about an aggressive nuclear (bankrupt) state trying to play overlord on the backs of preyed-upon civilians.  The military had seized control of the intelligence apparatus and had pre-emptively attacked a neighboring state on false pretenses.  Here, WDC was going down to defeat yet again, [a Loserville](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/double-feature.html) for pro losers by this time, in part because perceived as a Wall Street pawn, a Saruman sell-out to Mordor.

The USG might still [bounce back](http://grunch.net/archives/117) in some way shape or form.  I'd suggest in competition with [the faux capitalists](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html), so afraid of competition and so protective of their antediluvian "economics", a step child of the social sciences and statistics.

GST uses a stronger science and recruits stronger players.  The more trusted banks are almost by definition distancing themselves from the sleazier wheeler dealers who want to reap a killing selling basement fallout shelters or the modern equivalent.  Preying on people's fears:  you can smell those businesses a mile away.  They traffic in terror.  Why lend them your reputation then?

In the history books and comic books (e.g. Captain America), the USG (or some avatar thereof) still had some juice when countering the most craven.  Has that influence been spent?  Have the neocons and neoliberals destroyed America's reputation?  I think we still have [pockets with integrity](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/02/tell-truth-and-run-movie-review.html).

OK, that's probably too much optimism for one blog post.  The reality on the ground is far more sobering.

The fashion section of the WSJ was more interesting than the shrill headlines.  I notice more women than men in the creative / imaginative sectors.  The dullards stream into safe commands and park there, apparently, supposing their investments are safe because their bankers read the same papers they do (and maybe get more out of them?).

Mostly, when mom isn't here, we just recycle them.  Lindsey is somewhat horrified by the waste, but then that's her chosen role.  The dog walks have been helping, and we recycle the plastic.
