This morning I joined Friends for some free ranging discussion.  We used a stuffed camel for a talking stick and took turns reading from a philosophical treatise by a zen master which quotes the Quaran a lot.  I'll email Ron and Peg for the title, and append it here when I get it:  [Creation and the Timeless Order of Things: Essays in Islamic Mystical Philosophy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883991048/sr=1-1/qid=1138593010/) by Toshihiko Izutsu.We didn't all jump on a bandwagon. A lot of us (me included) swung invisible swords, cutting through whatever was holding us back on some personal inward journey.  This means that outwardly, this wasn't a picture of everyone nodding and agreeing about everything.We took issue, were at odds.  The camel helped, plus the fact that we're quite practiced as Friends.  I said the "face" metaphor reminded me a lot of [Teletubbies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142055/) (a baby facing an imaginary creation).One of our number does electrical engineering with Intel, is a group leader with respect some some important nanoscale chip architectures.  She reminds me of an astronaut in some ways.
