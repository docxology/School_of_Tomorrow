A very not-scary film about kids wanting to grow up and see the world, yet getting resistence from an older generation that has already seen a lot of the world and is wanting to protect and shield... but not stunt.

Daddy Dracula (Adam Sandler) has experienced the nastiness of humans.  He's a misanthropist for a reason.  Who can blame him?

Vampires are clearly cooler.  What's not to like about them?

The animation goes back to the roots, skipping recent recastings, and doesn't even try to make Frankenstein different from the monster.

Kid friendly, saw it at Avalon.
