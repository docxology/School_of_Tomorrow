If you know I18N ("internationalization") you may see N8V as "native" as in "local to a place". 

I've got that going with [Casino Math](http://wikieducator.org/Casino_Math), inheriting from Probability / Statistics but also Ux Design i.e. the aesthetics of game making. 

It's one thing to say "[it's all footnotes to Bingo](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/csn-circuits.html)" and another to actually craft a quality Ux (user experience).
