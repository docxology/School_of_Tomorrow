I'm risking writing about a movie I've not seen in decades, believe I saw only once, and which made quite an impression.With the benefit of hindsight, I'd compare it with [Blair Witch](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/drinking-liberally.html), but not because they're "the same" or anything.I like empty industrial wastelands, a chief attraction in Jersey City (many a late night meander, train hunting and such (nothing too dangerous)).  The stalker's work in [the Zone](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/) helped capture that for me.OK, now I should go order the sucker on Netflix, returning [Princess Bride](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/10/princess-bride-movie-review.html), which I checked out because Cousin Mary was really up on her [Andre the Giant](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000764/) lore, which I also study, especially through the art work of creative genius [Shepard Fairey](http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=%22obey+giant%22&).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiBtn6rjNluAgDmR3WNPGqvtc9svlD6LH0xT74yAanCWi17qp80YObdwNg63p4jvN7Cq-f9F38uCN7ShYCln9KFU1R8u4Ek7iK0cp4zVxqxJPSW5iptkDRNWgRVPmSDF1HYFcih/s1600-h/311_Don't_Tread_on_Me.jpg)
