Stallings saw [Mindwalk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100151/) again recently, liked it better than [What the Bleep](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399877/).  [My Dinner With Andre](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082783/) falls into the same category (Nick made this connection), plus that animated [Waking Life](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017/).All of these flicks are heavy on the chit chat, low in the action department. But still, people like to listen in on intelligent conversations, a kind of healthy voyeurism we learn as children, perhaps riding in the back seat, listening to pilot/co-pilot banter.In my [Project Earthala scenario](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/docs/infotech.html), [Grunch.net](http://www.grunch.net/) affiliates showcase [promising new technologies](http://images.google.com/images?&q=fly%27s+eye+dome&hl=en&btnG=Search+Images), using real prototypes, not just phony stuff.  Lots of strategic product placement and [brand repositioning](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/bworks.html) is going on, both [behind the scenes](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html) and in front of the camera.Our Reality TV stars have a lot of interesting lines however, so the genre isn't that far from the above philosophical films. Characters take strong positions. For example, I'm clearly wanting to keep our [Fuller Projection](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/map/dymax.html) nation-free at the base level, even if we allow such political data in overlays.Others might take objection.  [Bohmian Dialogue](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/mark-satin-at-powells-books.html) ensues.
