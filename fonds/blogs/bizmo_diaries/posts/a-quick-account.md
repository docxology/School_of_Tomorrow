I sampled the gym today, running in place for just 30 minutes, then whipped through a Trader Joe's in time to drop off the frozen goods (including salmon for dinner) before heading on down Division.The new [Coxeter bio](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4923445&tstart=0) arrived from Amazon, and I looked in the index for Fuller overlaps. No mention of Applewhite (part of the [fullerene story](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/eja1.html)). I found some [juicy bits](http://listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0610&L=GEODESIC&P=R2802&amp;D=0&I=-3&T=0) though, which I read after watching some Lost with Tara.I can't really fault the author (to whom I apologize for earlier referring to as "he") for steering clear of [Synergetics](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/), as this is a book about H.S.M. Coxeter and his geometry, not about Bucky Fuller's philosophy, although [Ludwig Wittgenstein](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/mingling-traditions.html) is mentioned, even depicted (pg. 107).[Wittgenstein](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/another-wittgenstein-essay.html) thought mathematicians didn't usually make strong philosophers -- true of his student Coxeter (whom he liked, plus used his room for meetings) but so what? He was a true [King of Geometry](http://www.amazon.com/King-Infinite-Space-Coxeter-Geometry/dp/0802714994/) and ain't that plenty?
