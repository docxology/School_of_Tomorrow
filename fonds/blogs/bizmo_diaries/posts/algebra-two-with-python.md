I decided to redo the sound track for this one, first recorded in January, mostly because of the big drop off in volume half way through, which I was unable to fix.  Then I decided a fresh narrative would be an improvement for other reasons.  However, given these are just archived pilots, I don't expect to be squandering much energy on polishing them.
