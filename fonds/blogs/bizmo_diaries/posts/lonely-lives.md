Some days I kick back and delve into Youtube.  Given what I pay monthly for optical fiber, to CenturyLink, I think of such R&R as getting [my money's worth](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/the-economics-of-abundance-46eaff7f4dd0).

Besides, I'm not just goofing off.  Youtube is not a porn site after all.  Yesterday I was immersed in [MIT's 8.04 Quantum Mechanics](https://youtu.be/lZ3bPUKo5zc).  Today, I'm back to freakish humans and the lonely lives some of them have.

That I would go back to watching about Pi Guy, who recites some 20K digits flawlessly, is apropos given what I've been up to in Jupyter Notebooks.  You'll find a link to the above video in the For Further Reading section.  I'll take you there [by way of edu-sig](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2018-October/012024.html).

Brain science sometimes struggles to explain these phenomena.  Reality stays humbling.
