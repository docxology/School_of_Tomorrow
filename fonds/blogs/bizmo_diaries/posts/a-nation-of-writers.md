I learned of this event from Glenn, back from Canada, and was first in line to get tickets.Powell's Books produced a movie about the writing of a book that hearkens back to those WPA guides to all fifty states, called [State By State](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2940552316/in/set-72157608011790377/).  The project leader and movie producer were joined by three of the authors, Ms. Wisconsin, Ms. Washington, and Mr. Oregon, with an emcee guiding the panel.  Their discussion led us to the movie itself, followed by Q&A with the audience.The movie provides close up impressions of nineteen of the fifty authors, and was shot in one day in New York City, in an American Legion Hall in Harlem.These are indeed amazing states, especially New Mexico.Followup video:  [Neurotic New Yorkers](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4472917n) (CBS News, Nancy Cordes reporting, 9/24/08)
