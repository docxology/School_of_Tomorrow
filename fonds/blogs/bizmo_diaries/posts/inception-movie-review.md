The movie was about dreams and projections, keying off The Matrix theme.  My movie-going companion slept through most of it and was adamant that Hollywood's self-indulgence was precisely what was wrong with this once great culture.  How could we bear to be insulted in this way?  And at what opportunity cost?  Why lavish such attention on fictional fantasies (waking dreams)?I suppose I'm more in the mood for more serious-minded documentaries, especially about the recent past.  More about [the U2](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/u2.html)?  Elections in Iraq?We haven't had many [Iraqi talking heads](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/memo-to-media.html) speaking their minds lately on any topic, other than the odd defector or refugee in past chapters, with sound bites used to galvanize and mobilize around somebody's war plans.  Lots of dead zones in the news, deliberate graveyards.  Lets go back and talk about what was missed.Also, getting more tetrahedra going, and not just on MTV, has been a priority in 97214, the zip code of geniuses.  I'd dispatch an away team tonight if I thought it'd improve the quality of our TV programming.Anyway, back to the movie, of which this is supposedly a review, I enjoyed some of the special effects, especially at the cityscape level.  My dad was a city planner and I was taught to appreciate cities for their character.  In the dream world of film, ideas get planted, that much is certainly true.  Memes spread. Sometimes one needs to counter 'em.I was back to the DoubleTree neighborhood, just two blocks away from the venue for Djangocon, reminiscing already.This initiative to prototype various brands and types of voting machine (electronic and mechanical) in high school settings, complete with tabulating back ends, along with lessons about security flaws, scams, the sordid history of voting, sounds like it'll result in some dynamite civics.Talking about dirty tricks, or just plain tricks, is not verboten, at least not among young adults needing to figure out what they're getting into with this democracy business.  Lots more documentaries then.  Stay tuned.
