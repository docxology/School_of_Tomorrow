We discussed this silly story: science fiction about a rogue Soviet branch of the KGB that leaked about its rogue activities to Bucky, who shared them in Critical Path, during our meetup the other day.  

Just kidding. Bucky has a similar weapon, a submarine aircraft carrier, but not quite like we see in this toy design.  Bucky is an experienced cold warrior and gives Russian intelligence a level of credibility.
