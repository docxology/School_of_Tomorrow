So here's a case of me feeling grateful, to Terry and ISEPP, for letting me lurk in on lectures all of these years, Heathman dinners.  My blogs are full of [this fare](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/radical-evolution-isepp-lecture.html).But I think it's time we pony up and buy bona fide season tickets, instead of perking along with the bookkeeping client.  Dawn was a bookkeeper and that's just not what I am, so DWA has had to morph quite a bit, though is still going strong.All of which is a long way of saying:  don't expect a write-up of the Oliver Sacks lecture this evening.  I'm not planning to hog a seat, out of deference to season ticket holders.  I'll be getting mine soon.On the agenda for today:  drop [PKL](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-beginning.html) pillow for repairs, dentist, other stuff.Outcomes:  PKL pillow fixed, went to wrong dentist so rescheduled, front bicycle wheel repaired, three pumpkins gutted but not carved, newfangled version of Glenn's global matrix promoted for use within [DWA](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/04/boring-tax-story.html), seeking Brian's permission for boot jingle.Neither Tabor nor gym (worked out at home).
