Global Matrix Studios enjoyed some guests this morning, through an international school connection.  I wasn't especially talkative, more [in the role of chauffeur](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/from-cult-hqs.html), even though Jerome was doing the driving (he's good at cards I discovered, over coffee later).I've been [sketching a fantasy](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/06/xrl-meeting-space.html) double deck office, converting the leaky deck above 4dsys (a router station) into a monitoring room, perhaps with a spiral staircase between them.  It'd have to be part of some video stream and/or movie production, to make it worth the expense.  Maybe Patrick has the connections.The reality is I need to buy some more plastic from the hardware store.Then came a quick haircut (someone new) and [Food Not Bombs](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/fnb-food-prep.html) at the meetinghouse (and more wifi).  Andy Cross came by and we went over some of what I'd learned at Djangocon (recently completed).  I introduced him to the cooks.  They bantered in Spanish.I stayed late to clean up, again having the building to myself.  Then the directory people showed up, intending to make phone calls, hearthkeeper among them (I hope I passed muster). I packed up and returned to [the Blue House](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/peace-garden.html) (so-called -- there's also a Pink House).Through the wifi, I was tracking the Python community's Diversity list, noting the link to an article by [a Seattelite](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Seattleite) about bioinformatics, about including more of that topic at the high school level.  This jibes with [my curriculum writing](http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/browse_thread/thread/fe73323dec55a19d?hl=en) as well.That could be a focus of [Pycon / Tehran](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/08/pycon-tehran.html) I should think, as health care is ramping up in that youthful economy, with many future doctors, nurses, technicians. A Pycon / Chicago [focusing on trucking](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/08/tomorrows-guis.html) might make sense, although here I'm thinking ESRI might want to get involved, as trucking has everything to do with GIS/GPS. I was also in touch with Mosaic regarding the Business Intelligence position at PSU, which would relate to our work with Ktraks etc.My thanks to Dr. Tag for dropping in for a family dinner last night, followed by a quick visit with 97214 geniuses (not at Pauling House this time).  I had [the PSF python](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/09/snake-story.html) (Naga) along (stuffed animal totem), plus two Django ponies.  I play the role of geek in this 'hood (namespace) and am somewhat expected to do geeky things of this nature.  Fortunately, I'm not entirely alone in this regard, meaning I get to clown around with my peers when I'm lucky.Glenn joined us at the new Chinese place on the corner of 39th and Hawthorne, in the Mason Building (Hawthorne Theater) across from Fred Meyer.  The tour included a look at [Flextegrity models](http://www.flextegrity.com/), though we didn't get to snap icosahedra together.  This was not an actual workshop, more just a tour.
