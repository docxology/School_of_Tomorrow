Well, my back isn't back to normal yet -- still paying for that splat at the roller rink. But at least I'm up and about, even lugged a bag of [dog food](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-bday-sarah.html) from the store this afternoon, plus did some gardening with Tara around the Mother Mary statue, so hey, it can't be that bad.Just posted some more of the same to math-learn ([link](http://www.mathforum.com/kb/plaintext.jspa?messageID=3688929)).  [The Math Forum](http://www.mathforum.com/) has new infrastructure for the [discussion groups](http://www.mathforum.com/kb/forumindex.jspa).[Nick](http://www.nickc-c.com/) is here checking his email on TMU (I'm using [KTU2](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/welcome-to-my-world.html), which has two monitors). He just showed up a few hours ago from Seattle and will be out by early tomorrow, heading east with Stallings.Stallings is doing a couple performances of [King Lear](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/king-lear-play-review.html) at a Umatilla prison -- he had a gig in New York City as well, awhile back (not surprising -- the guy is way talented).Dawn is reading a lot, mostly science fiction these days, though she enjoyed [Lindsay's book](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/rebuilding-iraq.html).I turned over [Childrens Program](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/childrens-program.html) to my successor.  At our last committee meeting we looked over the curriculum from [JACL](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/adult-first-day-program.html), a prized addition to our collection.Oh yeah, got another [check](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/pay-day.html) from PSU, no biggie.  Enjoying company of [wanderers](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/wanderers.html) and friends, including those times out on the [Columbia River](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/power-skating-with-ceo.html).Anyway, not a lot happening.  I have another meeting with [Ki Master George](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/twenty-wall-posters-digital-art.html) next weekend. I'll finally get to meet Father Bob, [insha Allah](http://www.themuslimwoman.com/justforkids/inshaallah.htm).  Maybe I'll post again then.
