For the above to be meaningful in any way, and not just an empty tautology, a figment of logic, it would have to mean something empirically.  But it doesn't.  Nor does the rest of the Tractatus. Hence the joke, sort of, that it's a lot of glorious nonsense.Later, in the PI, the boundary between sense and nonsense is not so sharp, given the last vestiges of logical positivism have been purged from LW's style.  The joke (of an unsayable) has now been reduced to more like a gagging sound.
