I have reason to use this clip in a somewhat academic context, in a footnote to [some timeit() project ](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/timeit.html)where different versions have to race.  The student is asked to cut a function's time by almost two thirds or more.

Rather than destroy the slower function, the two versions are raced, or maybe more than two.  In my thinking, this image of a "snail race" occurs, and this movie clip, which makes it all come alive in CG.

I also appreciate this clip because of its resonance with real life situations of course.  The film was obviously made with children in mind, and they know getting teased and/or teasing at recess.  They got teased for being "a crier" perhaps; and sure enough, one of the snails is immediately picked on by a bully.

There's no time to waste developing personalities however.  The film itself does that at leisure, but our clip merely takes us to the races.  Barely more than a minute.  Yet a winner is found.  Given this is a cartoon, the laws of physics need not apply.

The premise of this movie his hilarious:  a snail with aspirations to become a speed demon.  The sheer idiocy of the premise, combined with expert follow-through, makes this a favorite of mine.  I've already reviewed it.  Check it out.  Oops, sorry I'm slow... can't find it.
