Chris Fearnley of SNEC writes:Like everyone else, I've been thinking through the most recent examples of GRUNCH (GRoss UNiverse Cash Heist)[[1](http://bfi.org/?q=node/408)] and the partial collapse of our money-focused instead of "real wealth"[[2](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s10/p7000.html#1075.25)] focused economic system. I've been thinking about some of the ideas Bucky gave us to be effective at times like this (all quotes are Bucky's):
- "There is no energy crisis, food crisis or environmental crisis. There is only a crisis of ignorance." What facts are most in need of broader disclosure? How best can we disclose these critical facts?
-  "The things to do are: the things that need doing: that you see need to be done, and that no one else seems to see need to be done."
- What "local-Universe problem-solving" do you see to do "in support of the integrity of eternally regenerative Universe"?
-  "Emergence through emergency": now might be a propitious time to polish and present options for how to contribute to Humanity's real wealth assets to improve its cosmic accounting balance sheet.
  This global crisis may just need the kind of bold, creative, omni-responsible problem-solving and initiative-taking that Bucky's Synergetics inspires us to adopt! I look forward to hearing about the initiatives and solutions you all are pursuing in support of our "eternally regenerative Universe". All hands on deck!He then gives some links, like [to Ron Resch's art](http://www.ronresch.com/), to a magazine called [Hyperseeing](http://www.isama.org/hyperseeing/) where Dmitri Kozlov got an article published, and to an upcoming workshop on [cellular automata](http://www.world-academy-of-science.org/worldcomp09/ws/conferences/csc09/cellular-automata-theory-and-applications), in connection with which Dr. J.F. (Jim) Nystrom, is looking for papers on the applicability of Synergetics.[Hal Hildebrand](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/blast-from-past.html) of Smalltalk fame used to chat with me about this topic (Synergetics and CA).  This was before Wolfram's A New Kind of Science and its trans-human model of what we mean by intelligence (e.g. [whales as Grunch CEOs](http://groups.google.com/group/soc.religion.quaker/browse_frm/thread/fcf71005f45142e5?hl=en#)).This just in from [Linda Richards](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/09/wanderers-200892.html):
