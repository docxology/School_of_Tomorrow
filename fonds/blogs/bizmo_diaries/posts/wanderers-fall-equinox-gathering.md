We were small in number, yet with interesting new people, invited guests.  I took fewer pictures than I usually do, if present, at one of these Equinox or Solstice get-togethers. 

We often meet at the boyhood home of Linus Pauling, where we used to hold weekly meetings, however sometimes we meet elsewhere, in retreat mode. 

We had an iPad going for those wishing to drop in by house WiFi.
