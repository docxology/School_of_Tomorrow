I hiked up Mt. Tabor this morning, which sounds impressive, however I might have used the word "stroll".  Some steep parts.  I almost turned around at the Narnia Lamp Post, but then decided to press on.

Coming down, I came across some interesting construction site activities involving a crane lifting heavy objects onto a flatbed truck.  I paused to take pictures.

What was going through my mind a lot was how I could write some new essay on Medium about Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics and quadrays, a coordinate system apparatus I've been yakking about since the 1990s.

However, around noon, before beginning said essay, I did a quick search and found these two postings, both with hyperlinks of their own:

[On Ludwig Wittgenstein's Contribution to a Pragmatic Philosophy](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/lw.html) (April 3, 1997)

[Investigations into the Linear Algebra Concepts used in the XYZ and Quadray Language Games](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/quadphil.html) (November 20, 1997 Last updated: October 1, 2005)

Wow, that's a lot of what I'd planned to write today.  Do I really need to write it all again?  Probably not.

A better use of my time might be to hack in to those ancient web pages and add some new hyperlinks to them, to more recent writings.

I found my materials using Google, just searching on Synergetics Wittgenstein as my two keywords.

[Ravasio](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/09/close-encounters.html) writes in her autobiography about finding out these high tuition schools for which loans are needed, not bothering to share [New England Transcendentalism](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/american-literature-101-224489c26f19) in the form of the Fuller corpus.  The math goes there too.

Academia will learn to "get off it" with the Bucky stuff, or it won't.  I'm thinking I won't lift a finger, as I want to see wheels turn without my input.  My goal is to publish less, not more.  Time to [wrap it up](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/08/archiving-stuff.html).

Sure, I'd help as a consultant on the 3D movies about the Concentric Hierarchy etc., but for those to happen, the Global U would need to strengthen its curriculum.  There's a chicken and egg vicious circle here, or maybe a "down the drain" vortex? Time will tell.
