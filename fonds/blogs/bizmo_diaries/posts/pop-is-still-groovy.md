One could read that on a number of levels...  Anyway, I rest my case:

I'd actually take it back to [the movie Samsara](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/09/samsara-movie-review.html) (saw it with Melody) which is about the machine-like powers of humans, to be precise (with a little help from their auto-tuners).  I'm happy to have found Lindsey-the-violinist [through this group](http://youtu.be/aE2GCa-_nyU).

Great mugging by the way, such pros.

"Television... rules the nation" and it's the music that gets you feeling free.  Yep.  Back to [EBN](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/12/private-language.html).
