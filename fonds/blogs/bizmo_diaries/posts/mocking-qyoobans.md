I mock "Qyoobans" who insist on saying 3 x 3 x 3 is "3 qyoobed" all the time, as if that makes 'em sound smarter.  [https://t.co/vh1jQxUWom](https://t.co/vh1jQxUWom)

In some circles, 3 x 3 x 3 is modeled with a tetrahedron, not a qyoob. The qyoobans (not Cubans) are too ethnocentric to realize that, duh.
