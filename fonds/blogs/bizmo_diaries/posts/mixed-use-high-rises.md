My comment on YouTube:Â 

The extent to which conversion is possible, to a more mixed use pattern, is indeed a hot topic.  Floor space for "day camp" (a kind of school) doesn't necessarily require cookie cutter apartments.  Think City Museum of St. Louis.  Flexibility (convertibility) is key. Sharing restrooms is common in college dorms and even some remodeled higher end hotels featuring retro-futuristic lifestyles.
