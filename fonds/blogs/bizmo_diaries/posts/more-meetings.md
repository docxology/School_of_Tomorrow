I quit Quaker-P though, since awhile back, in an effort to simplify.I started my day on the PSU park blocks with [Nick](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/10/mark-satin-at-powells-books.html), pouring over AAA maps of Northern California especially, getting insider lore, plus [Hyzy](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/10/social-hour.html) emailed a trekking tip and so on.
