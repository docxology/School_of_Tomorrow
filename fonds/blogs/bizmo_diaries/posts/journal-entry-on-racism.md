(commenting in an already long thread)

We
 can celebrate the expressiveness and adaptability of the human genome 
without buying in to the specific taxonomy of races invented mostly by 
white supremacist social Darwinists with an agenda to justify 
imperialism and/or slavery.  

The racists use animal husbandry 
for their concepts, wanting to identify humans as either "pure 
specimens" of this or that breed (race), or "mongrels" (hybrids, mixed
 race).  We could go much further in this direction if we wanted, with 
"Best in Show" specimens of whatever pure breeds the authorities decided
 to enshrine, perhaps inventing new races as time goes on.   In 
the meantime, racists forge ahead without any universally agreed upon 
taxonomy.  It all keeps changing, and "race" gets hopelessly confused 
with "ethnicity" which is different.  It's not that I don't see genetic 
differences (and/or ethnic ones), I just have little respect for the 
pseudo-anthropology that pretends to see a clear and clean taxonomy. A 
lot of academic white guys with snobby attitudes want to tell me, 
another white guy, what the races are.  Are there five or seven?  What 
are they again?    Their answers always sound stupid to me, from
 pretentiously pseudo-educated college and university types with a cave 
man's understanding of the world.  I can't credit racists with any kind 
of intellectual integrity.  They're a morally bankrupt camp and yes a 
lot of them have white skin and academic degrees.  I consider racists 
inferior, intellectually, in so many ways.  To believe in races is an 
ethnic trait.  Not everyone suffers from that specific meme virus.

 The
 original "I don't see race" post implies it's only whites who deny 
race, which is telling if true.  I'm going to remain on the lookout for 
prominent thinkers of a variety of skin colors, eye shapes and so on, 
who think we might need to revise our thinking in this area.  

If
 it's really true that only white-skinned people, palefaces, think the 
racial schema / taxonomy is a crazy-bad way to approach the reality of 
genetic differences (let alone cultural differences) I'd be surprised. 
But it's an empirical question. I should investigate more. 

My
 thanks to the original poster for starting this useful thread. I hope 
we keep revisiting racism for as long as it takes. Ashley Montagu 
considered it our most dangerous myth. We should not let up and just 
accept it unquestioned.
