In terms of nomenclature, I sometimes prefer "girl / boy" over "woman / man" because the latter makes a statement about an added / missing "wo" whereas the former simply says "genetic distance" (less spin in some dimensions).In my writings, you'll sometimes see me saying my XX-friend or my XY-friend, instead of girlfriend / boyfriend.  That's in part an homage to those beautiful [Sigourney Weaver films](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0000852/) and that idea of a special planet for "double Y" guys.  Cracks me up every time (no offense to my [XYY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYY_syndrome)-friends, whom I can't tell from XYs).In any case, I'm sympathetic to the "multiple genders" school, don't really care how many.  Having worked as a school teacher in a Catholic academy for girls of high repute, I can attest that girls, like boys, differentiate into subtypes, which I don't need to rank in order to name.But then as a theater / TV /movie type thinker in some ways, I tend to more or less abandon "gender" in favor of "role" and get more into stereotypes / archetypes at that point.In terms of [namespaces](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/civil-war-day.html), in other words, I don't really sound like any kind of gender therapist or whatever, neither do I talk about "chakras" that much (I keep getting the colors mixed up), although I have male / female friends who do talk this way, and I'm able to follow to some degree.
