The King and the Mockingbird (English title for a film from France), is really not that old:  1980, my year to finish a four year college. 

And yet I'd not heard of it until now, a missing puzzle piece in some ways.

The mockingbird, a caring father of baby birds, [speaks truth to power](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/03/remembering-baryard-rustin.html), an insufferable King who has a crush on a much younger woman who's already Facebook Friends with a chimney sweep (read:  lower class dude) her own age (and type).

The King plans on asserting white privilege in true royal style, only to be stymied by a bunch of sensitive lions riled to rebellion by a blind yet hope-filled musician, moved by the mockingbird's sly tale telling.

The world Paul Grimault creates is awesome, complete with improbable elevators and a giant robot, [shades of Code Guardian](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/08/adventures-in-teaching-and-driving.html), all in a swoopy "[New Swine-stein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle)" castle-like setting (with allusions to Mad King Ludwig cite [Royal Babylon](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/10/afsc-support-committee.html)).

It's a modern police state in a nutshell, with a dictator run amuk. 

What a great anthropological study (and spoof) of a theoretical ant hill (of the kind humans build).  I'm so glad I got to view this restored (and dubbed) version.
