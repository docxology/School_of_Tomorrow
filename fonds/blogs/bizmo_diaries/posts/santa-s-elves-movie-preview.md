This one is about North Americans gleefully making bombs, designing new kinds of horrors, with many of them professing some kind of twisted "[religulosity](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/religulous-movie-review.html)" to justify their livelihoods.  Disturbing.  Reminders of [Why We Fight](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html).Keeping most of it a cartoon is a cute touch, as an offset to the grim realities. I can see where [the Elves](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/toontalk.html) wouldn't want to tarnish their good image (Lord of the Rings was too kind), and their morale is Santa's concern.Will it come out in 3D?
