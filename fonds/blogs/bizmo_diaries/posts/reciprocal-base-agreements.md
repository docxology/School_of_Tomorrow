Is
 it time to talk about inviting some foreign military bases to North 
America, in the name of reciprocity?  So many US in Okinawa and 
Guantanamo.  Oregon might be OK with a couple bases.  They're mostly 
used for joint marching band exercises, sports, practice using crowded 
airways.  We'll bring back the cavalry and make movies.
Ch√∂gyam Trungpa had an army going as I recall. They'd drill and stuff. Oregon could host a Tibetan military base, except the weapons would be metaphysical (like incense).
