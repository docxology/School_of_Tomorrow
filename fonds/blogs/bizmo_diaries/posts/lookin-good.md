Homecoming 2 of 5
I missed [my International School](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/high-school-memorabilia.html) reunion in Manila this year, have yet to see the new campus in person, looks magnificent.

The above 2nd segment of a 5-part video briefly looks at my era of attendance (1970s).

I recommend the first segment especially for its contrast between newer and older -- lots of history.
