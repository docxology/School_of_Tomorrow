In part inspired by Mark Martin's success, I've started diving into the X3D specification a little more, thinking to recast my Python modules geared for VRML output, probably using string.Template again (new as of 2.4).Speaking of string.Template, my ISP doesn't seem as Python friendly as before, with my request to install Python 2.5 on my host languishing for about a week now. A certain cgi script I'd hoped to upload is therefore not operational yet.I'd like to see a ranking of top ISPs by their Python friendliness. I'd consider moving my domain if my current ISP isn't at least above average. Of course only top ISPs allow cgi scripts in the first place, whereas many just pander to porn-trafficing tourists (a lucrative market, I don't deny it).Reading matter on my desk right now: Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust by Daniel Jonah Goldhagen, Linux Journal Issue 157, Envisioning Information by Edward R. Tufte, NetworkWorld, Volume 24 No. 21. 

I've ordered the movie Nightmare Alley from Netflix, hoping to learn more about the etymology of the word "geek." But first I need to finish Season Two of Slings and Arrows, a Canadian soap which I'm much enjoying.
