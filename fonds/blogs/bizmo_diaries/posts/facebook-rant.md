When a Medal of Freedom winner
 publishes a book saying "the USA we have known is now bankrupt and 
extinct" and that doesn't make headlines, we know right away that 
journalism lacks integrity. Walter Kaufmann (Princeton University)
 warned us about journalism. I sent "headlines we'd like to see" to WaPo
 at the time. "Medal of Freedom Winner Declares USA Bankrupt!"  I was 
living in DC back then, [making trouble with my typewriter](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/making-waves-in-dc.html).WIRED
 and such have little choice but to fall into the trap of [calling him a crackpot](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/buckminster-fuller-brilliant-crank-lot-teach-silicon-valley/) (as he hoped they would, Brer Rabbit style ("please don't throw
 me into the briar patch")).  When you call someone with that many 
patents, awards, degrees, published works a "crackpot" you pay a price, 
as what does that make the rest of us by comparison?  Setting the bar a 
little high are we?  Idiocracy ensues, with WIRED paving the way.So
 now we're in the situation where a thinker advertised to the world for 
his positive futurism (officially) is not read in schools because too 
much of a threat for speaking truth to power. Like 
how could one possibly claim to know or teach American History and/or 
Literature and not include that bit about a top celebrity turning a top 
subversive?  How can we claim to have any "public schools" whatsoever 
when the geometry for which Bucky was explicitly given an award is not 
shared?  If you don't read Grunch of Giants in high school, let alone 
college, you must not have had real teachers.  Phony baloney is what you
 got.  Oh, and now they want you to pay back those loans?  For what 
again?  For the heritage you never got?Instead of 
indulging in outrage, I can just sit back and laugh, knowing 
privatization is complete, the public schools are all dead, and Bucky 
was entirely correct in his prophesy and proclamation (as close to a 
declaration as we'll ever need).  The corporate 
media need very much to prop up their tawdry version of Uncle Sam (an 
imperialist psychopath), lest we see through it all and make Exxon pay 
for its own team of goons, rather than tapping into a privatized 
mercenary force funded by unrepresented Americans who's heritage was 
denied them in their schooling. 

They don't even share Bucky with the 
military do they?  Grunch of Giants at West Point?  Probably only the 
CIA reads it (required) as it's mentioned so often.After
 two generations of not teaching easy simple streamlining tetravolume 
stuff to 4th or 8th  or 12th graders (already certified useful by highest authorities), I
 think it's more than obvious we don't have a free press or a real 
public education system.  I feel free to endlessly mock the true believers and their pathetic substitute for real learning.

It's not like I'm saying that 
just because MF winner publishes yadda yadda, that we must all 
agree it's true, i.e. "yes of course the US is bankrupt and extinct, the
 great Bucky hath spoken." 

Not at all.  No one has that kind of power. 
 The book jacket calls it satire.It's just a once-adulated, much-awarded, icon of positive futurism, did in fact write 
that, and gave his reasoning and context, and then was awarded the MF 
(not tossed in jail). 

It's the historical facts of the matter I'm 
underlining, not that we have to treat Fuller's writing as edicts.  These
 facts are what're so amazing and crazy-interesting, especially when you factor 
in there's a newfangled kind of geometry, and geodesic domes and... wow.  Why not
 in schools?  Are we really that afraid of our own past?Lets just share the facts.  Then be skeptical and critical, say why he's wrong and so on. But
 to just claim he's a crackpot, so we're justified in our silence, no that
 doesn't fly it all. 

Too double standard. 

If Bucky's a crackpot, after 
so many faculty positions, awards, patents, inventions, then what are 
we, who think that way about him?
