Time passes more quickly now, and not just because I'm getting older.

Accelerating acceleration is what Alvin Toffler warned us about.

Events of just a few years ago are already vintage, like old black & white pictures from ages gone by.

That scruffy looking box in the back, leaning up against the fence (behind the C6XTY) contained a gazebo, coated steel frame, 10 by 10 feet when assembled (how tall?). 

I finally passed in on to a young couple with kids.  The mom came and got in her pickup truck.  Freecycle works.
