This went by on [the Chipy list](http://www.chipy.org/) today.Â  I've watched it before but this time had the sense to grab it for my blog:

Also today, in addition to chauffeuring a friend with a hip replacement around, I joined some women at the waterfront, East Side Esplanade at Salmon, for a quick photo shoot in honor of of the ongoing global [Kites Not Drones campaign](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/10/03/campaigners-stage-global-day-action-against-killer-and-surveillance-drones).

That's the abbreviated slogan.  [Drones](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/02/report-from-afghanistan.html) have their legitimate uses, just not in the hands of vicious killers.  It's a misappropriation of technology.  Women's International League for Peace and Freedom ([WILPF](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/08/wilpf-congress-detroit.html)), [Ava Helen's](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/excellent-adventure.html) old haunt, organized the Portland action.

I rounded out the day at a local temple (Newar Buddhist), on invitation from a friend.  Classical Indian ragas sung by an older guy, accompanied by traditional instruments, who knew what he was doing.  My ears took awhile to adjust but then that's part of the process.  By the end, we were pretty much all on the same page.
