The situation is I have hundreds of embedded slideshows using deprecated Flash technology, which the browsers are warning they're discontinuing the supporting of. So I try going back and fixing them, updating to the new method.  The slides are still there, organized in albums.  At the time of this writing that is.

Gus Frederick is a curator of Homer Davenport cartoons, as a fellow resident of Silverton, Oregon.  Davenport worked for the Hearst publishing empire among others, long story, achieving fame and glory for his talent and influence.  He was a horse nut, imported some Arabians from Mesopotamia.

As something of a curator myself, why not revisit this history?  Gus is a skilled videographer and also satirist.  I admire his work.
