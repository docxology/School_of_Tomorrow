This series of three shows a process for making a meme, using side-by-side images in this case, and suggesting Before and After.

As we find out in Part 3, the Before side is actually flawed, and it's in attempting to reconcile the two tables (exercising a conversion constant), that I discover and repair the Before side error.

As we approach a roll-over from 2019 to 2020, it's customary to make forecasts or suggestions, regarding what we plan to take on in the coming orbit.

America in Philosophy sounds interesting.

The whole idea of a "new world" was quite revolutionary.  Some people imagined striking it rich.  Others fantasized about utopian communities, including idyllic company towns or campuses.

Some of that same kind of brainstorming goes on here.  Could we have public schools that are also (A) boarding and (B) same-sex in addition to co-ed? 

These options abound in the private sector, but what if you're training to become functional in democracy?

My science fiction speculations are against a background of no public schools, given the American Transcendentalism I'm showing here is Verboten Math as far as the administrators are concerned. 

However, when it comes to art history and schools of thought in architecture, for starters, there's less censorship (strict editing) to contend with.

That I'm casting this curriculum as "high school level" makes sense, but let's remember that level is incorporated within higher level mindsets.  To introduce the "concentric hierarchy" at the high school level is to make changes in a parent or superclass, to employ and object oriented analogy.

Ways to carry the momentum forward through university level studies, such as in philosophy and engineering (e.g. tensegrity, flextegrity...), or even in a philosophy of engineering (cite Bristol, ISEPP), were pioneered in previous chapters, making it easier to work backwards, laying track coming from a future syllabus.
