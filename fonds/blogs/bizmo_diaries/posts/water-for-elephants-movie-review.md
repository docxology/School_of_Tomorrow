Really well filmed and acted. [Big name cast](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1067583/).

One might argue it's a tad tabloid, histrionic, pulp fiction.  In a word: corny.  So there you are, the audience, perhaps with popcorn.  Here are your freaks:  more beautiful than average, in a world of cruelty.  Quite the novel (soap opera, whatever).

The setting is the time of hobos, men sans work, riding the railroads to redistribute their labor, much as Amazon caravaners, other Dead Head type tribes, do today.  Wandering gypsies, in a Gypsy Economy.  Welcome to 2018.

The plot features a triangle: circus impresario (reminds me of Bug's Life) with stunning wife-horse act, hires protagonist of Polish background to work with the animals.

In a desperate economic gamble, an elephant is acquired, and it turns out she speaks Polish, meaning the impresario with anger management problems manages to not wreck his own circus for at least awhile longer.

Anyway, I was really impressed, especially by the elephant playing Rosie.

Queued for Iranian TV?  Total film nuts, like the Japanese.

Anyway, I'm proposing it for Pyconic conferences, for the movie track (similar to the hallway track, quite informal, more like BOFs).

"The idea that “height, width, depth” fall apart into three independent  linear dimensions always seemed somewhat sleight-of-handy to me, and I  resonated with New England Transcendentalism when I found a like-minded  skeptic, one R. Buckminster Fuller." [https://t.co/j0UrMLTk2j](https://t.co/j0UrMLTk2j)
