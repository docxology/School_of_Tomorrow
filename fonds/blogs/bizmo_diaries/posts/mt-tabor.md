Tabor](http://flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157601869018959/) as a "gym option" meaning cycling to the top counts towards my daily [fitness regimen](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/wanderers-2007829.html).  Today the summit was bright and sunny.  I napped some, text messaged, and, out of the corner of my eye, watched a beautiful woman pray.Earlier today I stopped by Harrison Street Studios and flashed my "business card" meaning in this case my 4D Studios page on Myspace (see margin of [Grain of Sand](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/)).  I might be getting some rights to use sound clips by Gadgetto in some of these [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tp_ZycVtOKM) or higher rez rich data streams (e.g. my [Portland Knowledge Lab](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/vip-visits-pkl.html) pilots).Over on [edu-sig](http://www.python.org/community/sigs/current/edu-sig/), Jeff Rush has been [helping me focus](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-September/008228.html) on my uses of FOSS (free and open source development techniques).  The [MVC metaphor](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/08/model-view-controller-mvc.html) pertains.  Sometimes the Model and Controller code might be open, like a registry for doing clinical followup, but the Views are not because the actual data is for internal use.[Moodle](http://www.moodle.org/) itself is open; the contents of moodles may not be.Later:  some gutless wonder banned me from Philosophical Coffeehouse today, an obscure Yahoo Group where I was trying to get some work done.  Maybe he's now going through and deleting all my posts.  Oh well, I'll write 'em off as first drafts of some stuff.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEip5EzLBffRKkeAxAoLb0Hzn0Q9lrdJa7FS70bqPOSDX0VXmQoed1OL4gml9CIrVlOb5kas1tN4e_vmfkEsPoxE0EjqMTfzJvq5xei247eW4VlMxHh8Ksu9r41bzcGajXGfPBgT/s1600-h/sarah_hexapent.jpg):: sarah with hexapent ::
