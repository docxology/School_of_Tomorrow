Today they pour a foundation, using this yellow truck as a source of concrete (these so-called concrete mixers travel between quarries and construction sites).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi5fWev6okVocJeKEv6itwJZQIAn7g1yCO8OFo5xvkOTfi1VD61EIoj2hG47FBlJC3KUT4OJir6TAn59csLiZK_iWEW2IZ9eFGF4wSSspckm_hsw2wKdDqPYitQDptDBsjsD5mf/s1600-h/backyard.jpg) If you check Google Earth after awhile, and compare, you'll find this change, one of a million like it happening every day. Like, the neighbors behind us have likewise made changes to their properties (all very much to the better; we have good taste around here). In our case, we just changed the house color recently. Harold Long, the Frank Lloyd Wright trained architect, and number one ex of Maureen's, did some drawings for our garage awhile back. I implemented some of his ideas, but there's still room for improvement.I'd rather be doing greenfield development around [Earthala](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/project-earthala.html) though, and not just in [Blender](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/02/geek-lore.html).
