[Dave Koski](http://koskiskiosk.com/) is juggling those Baer cells again, getting cool [enneacontahedron dissections](http://www.orchidpalms.com/polyhedra/rhombic/rh90/rh90.htm).  You'll find related reading at [George Hart's web sites](http://georgehart.com/), [also mine](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/tmod.html), [Russell Towle's](http://home.inreach.com/rtowle/Polytopes/polytope.html).The five Baer cells, all zonohedra constructible with Zome, amalgamate sequentially as convex polyhedra, out to the enneacontahedron. Dave is noticing the surface : total facet ratios apparently traverse the sequence 1:1, 1:2... 1:8, e.g. the five ways to build a hexahedron involve solo Baer cells, so 1:1, whereas dodecahedra might be assembled seven ways, always from 4 cells (4*6 = 24 facets, 12 on the surface, 12:24 = 1:2 and so on). Additionally, eight icosahedra, seven rhombic triacontahedra, five with 42 faces, 2 with 56 faces, one with 72 faces, and a final enneacontahedron of 90 faces (the proverbial partridge in a pear tree), all fit into this simple, rational rubric.
