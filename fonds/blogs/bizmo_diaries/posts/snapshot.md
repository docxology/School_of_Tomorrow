I thought I was delaying my trip, on foot, to the local market, in order
 to catch the CBS Evening News at 6:30 PM.

However I got caught up 
reminiscing about my Quaker ethnicity [on edu-sig](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2018-September/012020.html), and looking up at the 
clock, realized it was almost over.

I caught where Hasbro says Bizjet 
is now OK in Scrabble, but not Bizmo yet.Â  Then came a story about a loyal all American national anthem singer.
