Thirsters are meeting tonight, for a final moderated debate in the current format, after which we'll have a celebratory page turning event, a new format having been selected.

I'll be one of many on the call. As we started to find out last week, my camp is in favor of giving the Legal Eagles their chance at bat, and if they're able to win against the Trump organization so be it.  The powdered wig subculture cannot afford to be overruled by some angry mob that threatens violence if not given the "right to vote" for its figurehead.

However, I'm not seeing this camp in partisan terms, if by "partisan" we mean taking sides in the duopoly, and thinking this is Biden versus his political opponent. No, this is a Constitutional design pressure test, where a 3rd branch (the Judiciary) is challenging the Executive, Congress (the Legislative branch) having passed the buck on impeachment.

To review what happened: the January 6, 2021 riot led to a second impeachment hearing regarding the US president's fitness to continue in office, but by then he was already on the way out, so what would be the point of kicking him out?

I take this view in part because "new circuit designs for Motherboard Earth" includes more thinking about USA OS, i.e. seeing the government as an operating system and thinking more in those terms. Dividing government into these three branches -- judiciary, executive, legislative -- was very forward thinking on the part of these design science revolutionaries.

If the judiciary is so weak that it'll cave to threats about Civil War or whatever, then we're already well past pull date on the Constitution, and should admit we abandoned it long ago. On the other hand, if we're still truly concerned with democracy, then we have to learn from being tested, and iteratively improve our designs based on what we've learned. 

The core issue at his time is the level of immunity from prosecution a US president has. This is important because of all the war crimes that presidents have been committing, in contravention to what's considered normal behavior in civilian circles. Should we apply medical language and deem the State Department a madhouse (asylum for the insane)? Or should we take a more mocking tone?

I'll find out more, tonight, about what schools of thought I might be up against. My impression is most others on these calls are schooled to think in terms of two parties, nowhere mentioned in the Constitution, and from my angle somewhat irrelevant to USA OS designs.

Ever since the demise of Uncle Sam as we knew him, per Grunch of Giants, and as civil rights got rolled back in the name of "fighting terrorism" the question of what would constitute "legality" going forward would become more acute, especially for US voters, citizens, denizens. What would "government" mean?
