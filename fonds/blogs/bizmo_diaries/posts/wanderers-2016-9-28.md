Pretty funny:  some of our Wanderers have never seen the opening premise of the Portlandia TV [comedy show](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/05/darker-comedy.html).

I screened the above for their benefit, along with a short excerpt from [my Nepris interview](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/talk-like-pirate.html) (like a TED talk).

When Bernie packed Moda Center (I missed that one), a bird landed on his microphone.Â  Unless you know the phrase "Put a Bird On It", you've missed something.

I drew a silly picture of the two-headed "Hilladon" (prehistoric) on the whiteboard and posted it to Facebook with my cellphone.
