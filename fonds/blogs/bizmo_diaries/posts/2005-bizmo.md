[](http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/640/bizmo2005.jpg)On-board monitors(photo by K. Urner, Olympus Stylus 500)Left monitor: HDTV connected to [HDNet](http://www.hd.net/) via satellite, and currently receiving Sunrise Earth, a no voice-over, slice-of-life program designed to showcase the high definition picture.Middle monitor: topomaps and biometrics (e.g. captain's weight gains and losses). This bizmo is tasked with gizmo prototyping and field testing, e.g. of vidcam equipment for exploring abandoned mine shafts (which the topomaps & GPS help locate).Right monitor: general purpose filesystem e.g. image log and music stash (speakers not shown, color printer behind middle monitor).
