We had our own little Bilderberg style summit, with high security, an exclusive guest list. 

Having my face on the HDTV, yakking away about RSA, reminded me of that Chomsky movie, where his face shows up in stadia, on billboards and so on, telling us about the exigencies of capitalism.

Of course the real Bilderbergs were meeting in DC recently, guests of the Hong Kong government or one of those. A lot of the guests are those Easterners I talk about, the transplant transatlantics, with their EU/UK mindset.  Yukes turned Yanks.

Out here on the Pacific Rim, we might be a tad less Atlantic-minded.  We spin it differently.
