I find myself returning to the homeschooling and unschooling literature, since the [Shuttleworth Summit](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/shuttleworth-summit-day-one.html), in part due to the influence of [Paul Fernhout](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-May/006456.html), an [edu-sig](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig) poster.  But I've [always](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1383617) had an interest in this literature.  Laurie Todd, a master teacher, is another influence.You'll find mention of this demographic (home scholars) in at least two [[1](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4711093)][[2](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4711240)] of my postings today, both to the Math Forum.  Plus Tara is simulating emergent civilization right behind me, having just installed [Sig Meier's Civilization IV](http://www.2kgames.com/civ4/home.htm) on TMU (meanwhile, I'm typing on [brain-damaged](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/big-foot-strikes.html) [KTU2](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/welcome-to-my-world.html)).I like the new Python logo by the way:  very Azteco-Mayan or [whatever](http://www.altontobey.com/murals2.html).[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/python-logo.png)
