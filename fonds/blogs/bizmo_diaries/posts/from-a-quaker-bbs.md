:: "guilty dog" compilation ::

[](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profile/KirbyUrner) Comment by Kirby Urner yesterday [on QuakerQuaker](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profiles/blogs/is-religion-motivated-by-guilt-trip), one typo fixed, links added:

I suppose a starting point
 is to what extent do we think guilt is built-in chemically, like a 
hormone, versus cultivated as an institution, a complex social practice,
 like a game.  I know people like to post Youtubes of "dogs looking 
guilty" however I sense some projection.  I'd say the basis for guilt is
 in mammal behavior but full-blown guilt is reserved for those with 
significant linguistic abilities.

In Nietzsche's code of ethics, any grudge-keeping, ax-grinding or 
resentment of any kind within oneself, is a troubling sign of mental 
weakness, a loss in personal power, a kind of retardation.  So in Will to Power and
 other works, the aphorisms and meditations are geared towards stamping 
out such things, as too base for a true Übermensch or whatever.

This [code of ethics](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/01/techno-morality-linus-pauling-memorial.html) later surfaces in the San Francisco-based "est 
Training" wherein trainees were sternly warned against any "putting up 
with" or "trying to change".  Guilt came in for a drubbing as 
something slavers used to deter our exercise of true freedoms -- 
something like that (I went through a few of these est Trainings in the 
late 70s, early 80s, including with overseer responsibilities as a 
Centers Network volunteer -- like with Quakers! -- but each one was 
different; it's called The Forum today ([Landmark Corporation](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/at-landmark-event.html))).
