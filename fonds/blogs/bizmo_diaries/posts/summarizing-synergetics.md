P controls details of shape, is a product of primes. F is a relative time-sizing parameter, with its 2nd power denoting surface area, pixel density or whatever.The M/P is part of an "above/below the line" motif, as is [4D/4D++](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/4d.html).  In each case, "above" is outside of time the way XYZ is, before we add a time variable. "Below" is the realm of Heraclitus, always changing (full of energy).  U (Universe) is a synergy of both.There's a tension between fourness and fiveness, with the former symbolizing both open-mindedness (cuboctahedron) and a closed system (tetrahedron), the latter a self-centered rationality in rebellion (icosahedron).  Something like that i.e. we don't actively defend against [Jungian type readings](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/psych.html), the way some of the more literal-minded self-disciplines do.There's an "energy has shape" theme in that the E from Einstein's famous energy equation is fed into the eternal shape mix-master, adding whatever [Eulerian topological qualities](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/synintro.html) to this Gibbsian stew (or brew).  Translated:  energy comes in patterns with their own timeless integrity.
