[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3758608503/)Derek phoned to alert me to a new phenomenon in our neighborhood (no, not those UFOs in the parking lot):  an outdoor patio for Peet's customers, on the roof of Fred Meyer.My take was: lets turn the rest of this deck into an Asian garden of sorts, something that'd work [in winter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTKedyQQkZQ) as well.Just a fantasy, as Hawthorne hasn't gone car-less yet, though it's tempting to make it so, more like Venice.Scraping 'em off the roof of Freddies, like so many cockroaches, might be feasible though, encourage more Euro-style shopping, a little here, a little there, on foot or by bicycle ([Burley](http://www.burley.com/) is an Oregon company (considering Python?  that [JRun](http://www.adobe.com/products/jrun/) OK for ya?)).That's how neighbors use the place, with string bags and pull carts, none of this SUV-centric "freight train" approach, as if the nearest next watering hole were 400 miles distant.  This isn't Wyoming after all.However I do understand we're getting more out-of-towners these days, wanting to stock up on souvenirs 'n stuff.  Recommendation:  leave the rig at your motel, use Tri-Met, sample the Portland lifestyle for real.  We've got a fareless square 'n everything.We've got no aquarium quite like Chattanooga's (nobody does), but our art museum is top notch, has a Snelson, plus PDX (the airport) has those [equus-looking things](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/hunter-art-museum-chattanooga.html), plus there's OMSI and Oregon Zoo, a deep Max tunnel.Check us out!  Bring the kids!
