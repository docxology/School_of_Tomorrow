Speaking of all this (see last post):  you USA kids should understand something I learned in South Africa.  A lot of Afrikaaners, many of them of Dutch descent, really look up to America a lot (and yes, that includes the USA).  Why?  Because the perception around South Africa is that America somehow managed to win a war against the English (I'm speaking of the Revolution, the one Ben Franklin was in), whereas in South Africa, everything is apparently still Commonwealth.  "So how'd you Americans do it?" is the oft unspoken question.  Answer: we had a lot of help.
