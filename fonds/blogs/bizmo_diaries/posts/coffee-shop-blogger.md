Per Abraham Maslow, if truly wishing to be money-minded, we should quantify all the "intangibles" as income, such as sitting in a coffee shop in Portland, getting some work done via the free wifi.That's worth an extra ten grand a year in the form of "cool working ambience."In exchange for all that extra compensation, I should feel motivated to tackle some hard tasks, like test driving Python 3.0 alpha.Except it's almost mindlessly easy to download and untar the tarball, run configure, make, make test, sudo make install, so that really doesn't count (tests still running).Ah, here we go:Python 3.0a1 (py3k, Sep 19 2007, 20:25:27)[GCC 4.1.2 (Ubuntu 4.1.2-0ubuntu4)] on linux2Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.>>> However, I do do [harder tricks](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-September/008236.html) too, in exchange for this cushy Portland-based lifestyle.Don't think I'm not appreciative.
