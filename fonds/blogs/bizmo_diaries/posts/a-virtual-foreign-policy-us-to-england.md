Unlike those LaRouchies maybe, I have nothing against the future King or Queen of England.  Nor against the one now. A lot of my work around "virtual presidents" in USA OS (borrowing the time-slice metaphor of "virtual machine" (as in "mine, all mine")) translates into internalized royalty talk.  It's sort of like the case with Wicca (see Triumph of the Moon): the UK invents it, America takes it and runs with it, transforms it (sound of something wooden breaking -- a Tomahawk, by the sound of it), and hands it back.  And here's the punchline:  you actually like it better this way.
