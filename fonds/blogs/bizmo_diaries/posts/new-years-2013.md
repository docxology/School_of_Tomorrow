I watched the above geometry clip, by DK, among other things.

Tara and I had rented a pile of DVDs, among them 56 Up (like my age), and We Steal Secrets:  The Story of Wikileaks, which probably deserves its own review. 

I watched the latter, having seen 56 Up shortly after getting back from [our trip north](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/12/chronicling-captains-log.html).

I also attended to AFSC business.   At the [last corporation meeting](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/03/big-picture.html) (in early March of this year) I was reading the testimony of Bradley Manning.

Phone calls, emails, text messages... I wouldn't say I'm alone.  But nor would I call this a party.  Just hanging out.
