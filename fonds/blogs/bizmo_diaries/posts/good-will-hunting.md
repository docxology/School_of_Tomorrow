No, [not the movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217/), talking about brands seeking loyal customers, say in the [coffee shop business](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/12/caf-philosophique.html).The name of the game is "steering through consumption", giving customers the privilege of [voting with dollars](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/ppug-20081014.html), meaning we've earmarked some of the goodies with cause-related info, tagged 'em with tokens somehow (probably in software).Say when you buy a chocolate bar from some (Quaker?) company, an LCD shows positive changes vis-a-vis the advertised beneficiaries, the retailer remitting sales info in exchange for a discount (a mutually beneficial trade).  Buy this scone, help a kid in Zimbabwe; Newman's Own (brand) pioneering in this regard.Such microtransactions do add up, but are counterproductive to track manually, too much nickle and diming, which is where [open source software](http://www.bridgepdx.org/) enters the picture.  A back office profile will store the fund accounting tables [in SQL engines](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/open-source-database.html), such that beneficiaries have a way of checking their balances, perhaps through a bank.Shops will differentiate [within zip code](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/neighborhood-meetings.html) according to customer demographics, i.e. in some necks of the woods, a beef jerky purchase might net a few dimes to the NRA.  That doesn't sound much like Portland though, a test market for these concepts, [as well as LA](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/studious-nation.html)?
