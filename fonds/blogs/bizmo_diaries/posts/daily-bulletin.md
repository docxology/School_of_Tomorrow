We're gearing up to check out [Milepost 5](http://www.milepostfive.com/), not neglecting the local neighborhood block party, something to get back to.

On the edu-sig ministry list I'm pushing the analogy between [teaching programming and teaching piano](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-August/009485.html): each teacher has a style and usually the students come to the studio, although the idea of an itinerant piano teacher is also a well-known script (or program).

We also need to do more to link theater and computers, per this "agile" meme.

Is a musical instrument "event driven"?

Good Bye Party [at Muddy Waters](http://muddywatersportland.com/) tonight...

Here I am using MW wifi, having a couple cans of Old German Premium Lager outta Pittsburgh. Laura was singing a moody birthday song when I got here, then turned the stage over to [Lindsey Walker](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/experience-music.html) who is driving that Yamaha keyboard hard, delivering her unique and edgy sound.

Her Freedom Train is not to be missed. Everybody's Stupid expresses a darkly militant solipsism born of disillusionment, yet tinged with humor. Her Sex Doll, sung by the Laura, Lindsey on keyboard, Rick on guitar, all contributing vocals, is a true tour de force.

Dr. Tag and Beth have joined me, the blogger in the corner, [geekazoid](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=geekazoid) publisher of vintage brands of [kookaholic gibberish](http://www.freelists.org/post/wittrs/On-Distinction-Logic-Grammar-and-Cookery,5) (can't get enough eh?).

I'm thinking about [our Wanderers at sea](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/wanderers-2009818.html) quite a bit, hoping that adventure is going OK.
