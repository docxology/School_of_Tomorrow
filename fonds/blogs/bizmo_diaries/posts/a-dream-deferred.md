You’re
 probably thinking of a lot of frustrating delays, and of MLK’s “I have a
 dream” speech. If you don’t know about MLK, you likely won’t recognize 
RBF either, though most will know JFK and USSR.

However,
 I’m thinking of a delay you may not be: the postponement of “smart” 
houses (I’m putting off a definition). Instead, the Big Promise has been
 “driverless cars” (aka “people movers” if you lived through the 1970s).

The autonomous vehicle fantasies have eclipsed the next generation of Florida mobile home.

If
 a hurricane hits, Uncle Sam might have a FEMA trailer for you, but 
R&D halted on better shelter technologies, except in the area of 
high end camping (an outdoor sport).

You
 may be wondering when “smart houses” were ever a dominant fantasy, in 
which case I’ll point you first to the DDU (Dymaxion Deployment Unit), 
admittedly obscure, and then to the first true Dymaxion House, which 
hung from a utility mast but didn’t sway in the wind.
