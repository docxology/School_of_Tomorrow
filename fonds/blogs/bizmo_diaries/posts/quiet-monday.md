Tara says every outdoor scene in [House M.D.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/) shows it raining, emphasizing the Seattle backdrop, more of our Pacific Northwest rainforest economy.  Lots of flooding, on Hwys 217 & 26 around Portland, and Hwy 101 at the coast ([Tillamook](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/tillamook.html) especially).Naga, the pet snake in my office, keeps doing her upside-down routine, learned when she was still a pup.  There're some circus tricks you can do when you're all backbone.The two teens finished pasting up their [science posters](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/sixth-grade-science.html) on Saturday, using my office.

End users pay the going price, no locking in with futures, the basis of many a fat margin up line.The [dishwasher](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/home-appliance-story.html) is still working perfectly, thanks to Les & Elise.  Even the [shorting-out problem](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/10/olpc-in-brazil.html) seems resolved, which I hypothesize now was owing to the shot-through heating coil on the same circuit.
