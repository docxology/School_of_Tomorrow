Babies is not narrated, uses music and environmental noises for sound track.  This helps recreate a baby's world, not beset with lots of yammering.  Adults play their roles, but not as generators of lots of talk balloons.What's most striking about this film is that it focuses on healthy babies just having pleasant childhoods, no trauma, no strife.  The four families are all dignified and provide nurturing environments.  The different civilian lifestyles, though diverse in their resource consumption patterns, do not seem in need of drastic overhaul. There's no message about helping anyone out of their poverty, as these families do not seem "poor" and their worlds are not war-torn.The film is also not trying to be comprehensive.  One could see sequels featuring other ethnicities, but sticking to just four families.I saw this at The Bagdad with the one baby I'm genetically responsible for, now a young woman embarked on a life adventure of her own.
