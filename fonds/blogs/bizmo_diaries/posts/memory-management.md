[This month](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-May/date.html), our resident experts weigh in on what models to use and how best to communicate them.Yes, I was thinking of [Shomar](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/wanderers-20061212.html) when I mentioned the [English Mastiff](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-May/008550.html) in my example.Speaking of programming, I've modified my beer intake regimen (near zero for [nearly a year](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/beer-note.html)) such that I'll sometimes sample homemade noncommercial brews, if/when these are offered.  Home brewing is a favorite pass time in Portland.I might also permit myself to enjoy a festival or two this summer.Still no random pints "just because I'm in the mood" though -- I wasn't spending those extra calories wisely, if at all.
