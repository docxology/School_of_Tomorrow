I've found myself wishing "cooking" were closer to "chemistry" in English.  We may [work to bring them closer](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/06/interdependence-day-2012.html).  The high school subject of Health is clearly mostly biology and chemistry and yet anything we put into our mouths, especially if we digest it, or absorb it, is of a culinary nature.

We're [eating chemicals to make chemicals](http://www.science.ie/features/archived-feature-articles/chemistry-of-cooking.html), after going to some lengths to prepare them.  Sometimes the foods we like depend on biological processes that last years, as when we age whiskeys and wines, and of course cheese...

Dietitians sometimes wish "food" and "medicine" were closer I'm sure.  One prepares food with greater attention and certainty if thinking in terms of cures, but also of developing propensities.

Sometimes the goal is simply to stay awake, and knowing what inputs lead to sleepiness... this kind of folklore, once codified, is somewhat core to one's culture.  How many trips to the refrigerator do you make in a day, and does it keep count?  How many joules in?  How many joules out?  Thinking this way, in biochemical terms, is what athletics / sports are about too, so it all fits together.

Lets go back to the science fiction wherein some tribe is rallying against "schooling" coming in, as they see it, from outside.  Schooled people need to see in what ways they become dolts as a result of schooling.

They may be ignorant of cultivation, crop cycles, food preparation and storage, chemistry of the most personal sort i.e. cooking.  "Book learning" as they say, "is where one refines and complements hands-on experience."  Book learning alone is too thin, and watching TV alone, fantasy shows mostly, is to live impoverished, with less than the minimum recommended doses of real experience and skill building.

A dull routine by day, with fictional TV shows by night, and with no time doing one's own cooking, because pressed for time:  that's a rut a lot of us work hard to avoid.  TV dinners were at first a convenience, along with the microwave ovens, but what was lost was any knowledge of chemistry and self maintenance.  Autonomy was lost.

How about watching [more cooking shows](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/community-kitchen.html) that relate to health and biochemistry, while even following along, cooking yourself?  How about making those cooking shows, as a part of your schooling?  You'll need to learn editing, setting up shots, doing retakes when needed.

School, leading to treadmill habits, obedience, leading to a full time job, a boss, was maybe what the factory town-city needed, circa 1790s, and is maybe what military-minded cultures still need today, but if that's all that's meant by "school" then of course the science fiction tribe is making sense in resisting it.  We at least might [appreciate their qualms](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/10/he-named-me-malala-movie-review.html).

They don't want their children to grow up Borg, eating only TV dinners and living vicariously through TV fantasy lives.  They fight the "soul snatchers" and "soul crushers" as they see those forcing their kids into schools.

Kids come home no longer proud, but with self pity in their eyes, as they've learned of their "poverty" and how their old ways, their ancestral ways, are a dead end.  News to the parents.  Who dictates what "poverty" means?  Who gets to write the curriculum?  Do the curriculum writers know how to cook?  Is the assumption we want "full time jobs" working for "owners" of enterprises?

The tribes people notice how the Borg kids are forced to use money, to suppress day dreaming in favor of "school work" (in preparation for doing it full time), and to surrender to the merchant-sponsored storytellers come nighttime.

They're thoroughly programmed, these Borg kids.  Their story tellers whisper how fortunate they are and how unlucky are those still in parts of the world where money is hardly used.
