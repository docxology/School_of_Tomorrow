:: econovergence (day two) ::

Given the title of this event, you'd expect to find some economists in the line-up, and indeed we have a couple of those leading our teach-in, here on the third floor of First Unitarian Church. Mom is the next speaker in this room.

The economist we just heard, [Tom Palley](http://www.thomaspalley.com/) (EDOS), thinks the USG wasn't aggressive enough in the face of the implosion and that we'll be suffering some more shock waves. As [a GST guy](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/general-systems-theory.html) (general systems theory) I compete with some schools of thought, ally with others. [The sun](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/family-night.html) is what energizes the earth, not money -- let's at least be clear about that.

The other economist, Helen Scharber ([PERI](http://www.peri.umass.edu/)), persuaded us the renewable energy investments create more interesting work opportunities than just dumping funds into oil and gas. That seems likely.

[The Chinese system](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/stress-tests.html) is helping to keep the USA's afloat. That probably means we should be listening to Chinese economists a lot more?

Lindsey asked about what political climate would be required to motivate the kinds of policies our panel was advising. If there's another down turn, that's certainly not a guarantee of a more healthy political climate (on the contrary...). She also questioned the rather nationalistic analysis in terms of this or that government's policies -- spoken like a true [Global U student](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html) eh?

Tag and I found each other at the Free Food exhibit, sponsored by Urban Gleaners, while [Lindsey tanked up](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3978114049/) on vegetables. Tag knows a lot of people here, given lots of overlap with PSU and the student / activist community.

Leslie Hickcox phoned me with her congratulations on [Day One of Quarterly](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wqm-day-one.html), of which she managed to catch a part, in addition to making the Costco run more productive and enjoyable.

Speaking of congratulations, Don Wardwell has [his boat](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/back-in-service.html) back in the water. He and Barry have been working hard on hull restoration. He phoned from Island Cafe today, first time in awhile.

Mom's WILPF group began with a Raging Grannies number. Then she took us down memory lane, reminding us of Portland's resistance to the Pentagon's pet civil defense program (bomb shelters, duck & cover, other [Atomic Cafe style](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083590/) nuclear madness). The article in question: Portland -- the City that Chose Sanity instead of Fear by Carol Urner, Fellowship of Reconciliation magazine, January, 1965, page 11.

Portland is now remembered for being a small bubble of sanity in an intellectually lazy Lower48 (not that different from now in some ways). She also mentioned [Doug Strain](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/practicing-with-friends.html) and that Tektronix guy, and Senator Mark O. Hatfield (R), who helped keep Oregon from buying into [the military-industrial complex](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/barak-obama-power-of-change-movie.html).

This workshop may touch on how some of that self-discipline may be slipping. There's the new [army trucks contract](http://moneynews.newsmax.com/companies/daimler_trucks/2009/09/29/265993.html) (Daimler), the drones by Boeing ([cowardly killer](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/killing-field.html) or [spy](http://www.insitu.com/index.cfm?navid=20&cid=3916)?). No mention of [Evergreen](http://wweek.com/editorial/3315/8562/) though.

Barbara is going over the USG budget. 66.3% of the spending is towards mandatory items (vs. discretionary, the various entitlements and interest on the national debt).

The DoD budget runs around $533.7B, with $23.4B for DoE. $130B goes to discretionary occupations, sorry sad imperial crap, a lot of it highly questionable not to mention dishonorable. $9.66B for intelligence (so-called). Lots more numbers going by -- back to entitlements again (veterans, interest etc.).

We have brown envelopes to open with faux defense contracts enclosed. These states could've had a lot more health care and education if not blowing money on ill-advised, loser escapades in Iraq and Afghanistan. We get to affix these contracts to maps of Oregon and Washington at the front of the room.

Someone just handed me a leaflet about the Ralph Nader talk tomorrow. Portland is certainly a happening place this weekend.
