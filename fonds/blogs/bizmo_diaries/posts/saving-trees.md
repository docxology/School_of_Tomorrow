Forest-loving Portlanders have a problem with wasting trees, even if we recognize legitimate uses for lumber.  We have more intra-urban forest park than any other Lower48 city I'm pretty sure.Take those big dummy textbooks for example ([BDTs](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5540045&tstart=0)), the ones that make little kids fall over backwards, cause back injuries.How much worthy geometry or [geography](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6766098&tstart=0) will you find in one of those?  Was it worth a whole forest?We call these "gutless wonders" (a synonym) and know to look in the index for "what's missing" from their dogmas.We feel superior in knowing some of the "[math heresies](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/mite-fight.html)" -- called "being literate" in my neck of the woods, same as in New York I'd suppose.
