I
 don't see "the USA" as fighting Russia so much as an arrogant 
self-aggrandizing group we call neocons, which rose to power under 
Reagan during the Contra War against Nicaragua, and sees itself as being
 in charge.  Many Americans have no beef with the 
Russians and are in fact of Russian heritage.  Washington DC may see 
itself as representing "the USA" but some of us just see a silly City of Morons (one of my blog posts).  Clearly I have my own deviant rhetoric.

I
 also tend to shy away from historical accounts that make "nations" the 
principal actors.  I don't have any great belief in nations except as 
ideological / psychological constructs we use to organize our human 
affairs, akin to a corporation or religious bodies
 / institutions. 

The English language allows us to construct stories 
wherein Europe does this and London does that and Nicaragua does 
something else.  I know how to talk this way too, and do (when in 
Rome...), but under the hood I'm a skeptic.  Only humans have agency.  
These inanimate actors are at best a kind of journalistic shorthand.  

A
 faction of Ukrainian ideology wants "Ukraine for Ukrainians" and has a very definite idea of what that means.  Ethnic Russians fall 
outside the definition.  It's like if we had a faction here saying "real
 USAers" have to be white and of European heritage,
 anyone else is tolerated but is not as real. 

Given my upbringing as a 
liberal, I was taught that "ethnic uniformity" was a primitive older 
idea of "a nation" that had been superseded by the modern conception, 
one which accommodates a mix of cultures and religions and doesn't put 
any one of them in charge.  I call that "secularism". 

Secular nations 
(which accommodate religions) are the ones I'm snobby about and think 
more highly of.  "Ukraine for Ukrainians" sounds old fashioned and 
immature to my ears.  I'm sorry this faction has gained an upper hand in
 Ukrainian politics and that they have their proud boy types to enforce 
their racist views.

Translating
 to Americanese I might say that in my view 2014 was a January 6 moment, 
except the Trumpies won, the ultra nationalist Bandero Ukraine for 
Ukrainian proud boy types forcefully took charge.  The decent 
Ukrainians, especially out east, were shocked by 
this violent uprising and wanted out of this nascent nation-gone-bad.  
Russia is blue, fighting Maga Reds in Kiev.  NATO is fascist to the 
core, we know from what it did to Libya, where my family worked for six 
years.
