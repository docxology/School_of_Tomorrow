:: wilma, howard and bill lightfoot ::

My relatives bounced down on Amtrak for lunch in the Pearl district.  I met them at Union Station.

They only had about two hours in Portland all told, but then riding the Coast Starlight both ways was part of the adventure.

[Bill](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/03/on-road.html) pioneered the day trip by train experience [a few weeks ago](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/03/twists-and-turns.html) and had a fun time.  Why not share the experience with Howard and Wilma?

I started the day with panel discussions, on the relationship [twixt Stats and Data Science](https://youtu.be/C1zMUjHOLr4), and another [on Deep Learning](https://youtu.be/czLI3oLDe8M), so-called.  A lot of terminology has developed, unsupervised by any overarching Philosophy or even Theology department.  We're not doing trivium / quadrivium anymore.

Later, when back in my bat cave, I got to fiddling with [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/4dsolutions) some more.  We wade into social media at different times, with some people just keeping the door open with a kind of stub resume.  The Ux pressures for something more, which is fine, LinkedIn has work to do, a real job.

I'm continuing to [explore the implications](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mathfuture/eCn2ZS5lry4/Qql8KyImKgAJ) of a "[lambda calc track](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-pep-talk-of-my-own.html)" through Oregon high schools, consulting with [Ted Kosan](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/04/work-study-notes.html), Joseph Austin and others.

I'm liking this website on [Anti-patterns in Python](http://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/), which Jurgis Pralgauskis kindly shared [on edu-sig](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2016-April/date.html).  It's not like I've had time to speed read it all, just it's a decent stab at a thorny topic.
