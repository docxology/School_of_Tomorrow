In our Oregon namespace, [the Civil War](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/speaking-of-debates-today-is-civil-war.html) occurs once a year, on the gridiron, with OSU versus UofO.

Oregon State has black and orange, reminiscent of Princeton, but we're talking Beavers, not Tigers.  University of Oregon does yellow and green.

Woah, a 2nd touch down in about twelve seconds, with the Ducks tying it up.  The crowd goes wild.  A miracle before half time.  Go Ducks.

The teens are involved with science today, monopolizing my office, so I'm managing my business from the foyer, where I can keep an eye on the game.
