Warning:  this demo doesn't always work.  You might just get a swirling logo, after hitting Run. 

If you want to see the fish, you'll need to hit the Run button and then select the Output window from the lower dash.  That's where the fish are swimming. 

Mouse click to create more.  The D key eliminates several but never the very last.
