Dave got me out of my Richmond / Sunnyside orbit to an older section of Portland.

We discussed the ramifications of my coming out as a "Quaker animist" in terms of my practices, of inviting dogs to Wanderers gatherings and/or being openly friendly with a reptile on my [webcam](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/wanderers-2008116.html).

Given Portland's cosmopolitan culture, these are hardly noticeable eccentricities (like, just read our Willamette Week), but hey, maybe I'm making waves in Peoria or someplace.  Alabama?  I doubt it.

Anyway, always good having a chat with another krew mate on these matters.

I took along my copy of [Ghost in the Shell 2](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/09/wanderers-2009930.html) in hopes of getting scene 10 (Festival) moved to my iPod for personal use.

Dave also yaks about kayaks, took one to Mexico recently.
