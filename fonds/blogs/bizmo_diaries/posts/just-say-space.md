Should I write a memo or something?  I just had a realization in marketing space.CMO here, Chief Marketing Officer for CSN (Coffee Shops Network). So why don't I post on that blog instead?  Isn't this company business?  Yes and no.The realization is this:  our marketing is being done for us when it comes to "namespaces" (pointing back to PSF Python, see below), in that the pros are just saying "space" and "spaces" and have been for some time.  It's OK to drop the "name" in front."I work in the space of advertising" sounds about right.  As a phrase in the new vernacular, and also what I do in CMO mode.  I promulgate the idea of (design a space for) playing games for charity, stealing the acceptability of church bingo and drawing from casino space for some of my aesthetics, not to mention video lottery games.  You choose where the money goes, from a menu of options.  Build a profile in the process.  Be a hero.Actually that's more spelling out a business model, but leaving out the circuit diagrams I've buried at the CSN blog, to keep patent trolls at bay.  There's a bigger picture around designer giving, the strategic application of funds to specific scenes in the various movies we're making.  Now I'm starting to wear my Asylum City hat, which is not that different when it comes to emphasizing prototyping.  Asylum City draws experience from refugee camps, outdoor music venues (sound stages), the Oregon Country Fair, and even Occupy Portland (OPDX). So that's the memo: just saying space is OK in this space i.e. when we're talking about the various namespaces we're operating with or within.
