[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3346379250/)Wow we're a huge group tonight, packing a big room.  What beer joint will handle this crowd (Produce Row tonight).PyParsing (Brett Carter):Brett Carter is talking [about PyParsing](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/) ("the best thing ever", heh).  It's a Python library that easily lets you create BNF style grammars.  It's geeky, very CS (shades of bison).Backus-Naur Form (BNF) is a formal notation for languages.  Is this linguistics, "are we not men?" (citing Devo)?  Yes, all 35 - 40 of us are XYs (not always the case, as I've met many an XX "FOSS boss").There's a full grammar specification for Python 2.6 on the screen (yow -- or maybe not that bad?).  "Regular expressions on steroids" might be a way to describe this language game.  How simple an application might still be interesting?Now we're eyeballing a parser for SQL statements, now [for Icon](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/) (another language).  Why Brett, why?  Trying to convert a CVS repository to Mercurial...Machine Learning (John Melesky):I lost power in the middle of blogging about Machine Learning, unfortunate but I think there's a video recording happening somewhere...The presentation was all about geometric approaches to analyzing documents  (hyper-dimensional -- lots of geographic metaphors) versus the more statistical, as in Bayesian approaches (naive and not).  Detecting spam is a common example for the latter technique.Targeting advertising to specific contexts is a typical application for machine learning, automatic tagging.  Getting a handle on large stashes of documents, like blog posts, is the name of the game.[Divmod's Reverend](http://divmod.org/trac/wiki/DivmodReverend) (Bayes was a reverend) is way better than Ruby's Bishop, the port, in terms of speed and accuracy (plus Bayes wasn't a Bishop).Support Vector Machines: [PyML](http://pyml.sourceforge.net/)... [Orange](http://www.ailab.si/orange/) (academic i.e. semi-broken, still usable).  Technique:  munge with math to make the non-linear linear, then employ linear separation.Sorry I'm skipping the light bulb jokes (despite their mnemonic value).  John also said: "I have no Python code, I am a horrible, horrible man, but I do have an excuse, we found rats in our kitchen this morning".  This guy cracks me up.PyTyrant etc. (Michael Schurter):[Tokyo Cabinet](http://sourceforge.net/projects/tokyocabinet/), a data store (like for key:value pairs, B+ tree, other formats) is wrapped by [Tokyo Tyrant](http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/tyrantdoc/), with [PyTyrant](http://code.google.com/p/pytyrant/) the Python remote client.  The Tokyo Tyrant daemon is the database server and offers a lot.  It has replication, Lua extensions, hot backup, http option, is high concurrency, multi-threaded.  PyTyrant is lagging, probably because Tokyo Tyrant is evolving so quickly.  Other languages are ahead at the moment.Followup: [this post](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/portland/2009-March/000629.html) to the PPUG list; link to [Michael's slides](http://michael.susens-schurter.com/blog/2009/03/11/tokyo-cabinet-pytyrant-talk/).
