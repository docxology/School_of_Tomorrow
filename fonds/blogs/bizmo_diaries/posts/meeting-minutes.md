Thanks [Ken](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/02/meeting-on-hawthorne.html), for chronicling my wife's passing on Synergeo (#33127). We have so many partially overlapping communities in life, and in death also. For those of you entirely unfamiliar with my wife's story, and also for her friends, I tried to give a sense of it in [Grain of Sand](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/03/about-dawn-brief-bio.html).Per a posting to Synergeo just prior to yours (#33125), I'm seeing mental arithmetic getting a new partner in arms: [mental geometry](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1550381&tstart=0). Our students need both kinds of training, and computers will help. I'm thinking lexical and graphical, times tables and hypertoons.Dawn ran a tight ship around here, a business as much as a household. She and I were business partners for years before we got married, and our Dawn Wicca and Associates will persist as a business. She just paid Dick Hannah today, for extending the life of our Razz, per the post below. A factory new clutch was transplanted into the vehicle. These Subaru Legacy models are meant to last well into the hundreds of thousands, with proper care and feeding.I had a good talk with DeeKay this evening about Steve Baer's [dissection of the enneacontahedron](http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/dissection-re.html), into A thru E modules, hexahedral [zonohedra](http://home.inreach.com/rtowle/Towle.html), one of 'em almost flat. He's got 'em all done in Zome these days and ratioed to the phi-scaled T modules, per his trademark "language game" (Wittgenstein). He especially likes how the Baer B module gets composed.Koski has already registered [koskiskiosk.com](https://www.godaddy.com/gdshop/registrar/search.asp?isc=gppgt2000&domain=koskiskiosk.com) but hasn't gotten around to hosting it yet. All in good time. It's not like he hasn't been sharing his information.
