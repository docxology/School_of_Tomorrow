"We're now monitoring more than 270 degrees of solar                      longitudeâ€”that's 3/4ths of the star." 
"After                      all these years," she laughs, "we're finally getting                      to see the dark side of the Sun."

(Editor's                      note: The Sun has no dark side. That was a solar physics joke.)                      
Ali G. to [Noam Chomsky](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/makeover1.html):  "how many words to you know?"  Chomsky seemed annoyed, a bit of a slow dog, but hey, not everyone's a comic genius, at least not all of the time.
