The indigenous Cascadian response to the need for new campus facilities (Global U / GST), including for asylum-seekers (e.g. homeless vets), is connected to the citizen diplomat pipeline, the arterial system.

In another recent video I suggest the Madras, Oregon area as a place to test "outdoor school" equipment, which I'm suggesting we may consider already furnished taking into account the shipping containers of Good Will type stuff.  

We're able to get whole families outfitted with kitchen stuff without going begging to the "everything brand new" crowd for a slice of their shrink-wrapped just-off-the-shelf newer thing.

No, the whole point is we're showcasing what a less wasteful lifestyle might mean.  We work, but not to endlessly duplicate the same stuff.  Our "prop inventory" lets us change costume, and yurt internals, without necessarily needing a monetary transaction.  

A new aesthetic develops:  the nomadic monad.  You have everything you need on your person, and the luxury of not needing to own all these yurts you'll be visiting.  The campus has plenty of props in inventory, when you need those cups and saucers.
