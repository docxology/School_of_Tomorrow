Why do we name our little chat club at the Pauling House "Wanderers"? 

We cite this quote:

“Science
 would be ruined if it were to withdraw entirely into narrowly defined 
specialties.  The rare scholars who are wanderers-by-choice are 
essential to the intellectual welfare of the settled disciplines.”   -- Benoit Mandelbrot
