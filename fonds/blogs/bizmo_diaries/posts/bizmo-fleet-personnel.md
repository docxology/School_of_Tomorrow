As some of you know, I've been advocating for socialized ownership of my bizmo fleet, meaning it's more like a Hertz or Avis: the individual crew checks a van out of inventory, but doesn't necessarily have the title or responsibility for maintenance. There's a control room in the background, a dispatcher. The template is well established, even in capitalist societies.

Currently, I'd say Derek and Mazur are the furthest along in my network, when it comes to living the bizmo lifestyle. Both are familiar with the Honda Odyssey as a template. Derek is educating himself about generators, solar panels and such. Today we talked about a solar-wind village of about fifteen yurts (semi-permanent) where the bizmos could plug in.

However, my network is relatively tiny, and if one ventures into Nomad Land, either virtually or for real, the ideas worthy of copying come flooding in. Companies are working on more integrated solutions all the time. The van itself might be an EV. Opportunities for experimentation are endless.

Will Oregon host a Makersville where all these puzzle pieces come together? Am I talking about EPCOT West again?

One might think the community colleges and universities would already be pretty far along in making Nomad Life a degree based program. However there's a lot of inertia and propaganda steering students away from anything other than a suburban home in a bedroom community with a commute to some city job in an office tower.  

The corporate nanny state is trying to clone the past, given it depends on AI to discern the future. Clearly AI is not up to the task and our higher education systems flounder.
