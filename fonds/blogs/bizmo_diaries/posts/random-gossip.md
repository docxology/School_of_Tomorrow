From some Facebook timeline somewhere:

I'm still trying to figure out the IRA game (Internet Research Agency) as 
research seemed what it was up to:  stage events, gain followers, sell 
stuff, promote memes... but to what end?  Twas Bannon of Cambridge 
Analytica who overtly copped to trying to win 
elections, with that whole scary backstory about the secret Facebook 
quiz.  Facebook took the heat and learned to kowtow.

I bet IRA was more "oligarchs playing with the west's new toys" trying to
get in on the ground floor playing the new social media capitalist 
game.  Swinging the election was likely not a motive, not at all.  My 
hypothesis.  Facebook and Google are global goliaths and the Russians assume (as I do) that they're just as entitled to their troll farms as any lobby 
group.  IRA actually stood up to Mueller saying it had every right to 
play the game and Mueller backed down, seeing this as a footnote in 
history he'd like us to forget.

On the other hand, the whole Guccifer 2 business and Crowdstrike is a 
separate narrative and there we're told the GRU itself has its hands in 
everything, and working on Trump's behalf was definitely the goal in 
that case.  The Mueller report goes into great detail, showing the 
Russians snapping to attention when Trump called for them to find those 
missing Hill-Billary emails.  The only weakness in the narrative there  
is CrowdStrike wrote it under contract, with the FBI in no position to 
audit, only coach and cajole to get the narrative it wanted.  It's not 
what I'd call highly credible, even if it's in the Congressional Record 
(so is a lot of other garbage).
