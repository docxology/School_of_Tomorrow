Although the [three.js API](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/06/exploding-diagram.html) is pretty daunting, I made significant headway today after finding [I could use conda](https://twitter.com/thekirbster/status/741861983541026816) to include it in a Jupyter Notebook setting.  Thank you Anaconda.

I worked on two of my Python modules today:  [qrays.py](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/qrays.py) and [tetravolumes.py](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/tetravolume.py), with the latter now importing the former for testing purposes.

In hopes of helping more teachers get up to speed with this new content, I added a Getting Started link to my Scholarship tab at [Grunch.net](http://grunch.net/).  Here's [where it goes](http://bit.ly/1U1tjM5).
