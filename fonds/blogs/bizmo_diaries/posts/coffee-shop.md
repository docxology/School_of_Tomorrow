Elliot's view of Walt Whitman, WW's relationship with Emerson, other stuff. This was pursuant to a conversation with Sam in the high desert, about his own poetic influences.He drove off with Nick just now, Johnny did, having left a flyer with the barista (see above).Earlier, using my cell, I transacted an Amtrak ticket for Nick, who is eying [SUNY Oswego](http://snec.synergeticists.org/snec.meeting.2005.07.photos/page.html) again this year, having just returned from Toronto, Ireland, Berlin, the southern coast of France, other places. Quinn might get back to me with the $44 but I'm in no rush on that score.The [pixel fault](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/05/pixel-fault.html) in my Olympus Stylus 720 SW was fixed and returned under warranty. I've returned the earlier model Stylus to Tara, who'd kindly let me shoot with it in the interim.
