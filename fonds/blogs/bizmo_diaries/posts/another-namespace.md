It's time to [fill that hole](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/06/patter-about-poets.html) in my awareness. He was a [VBN](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/acting-locally.html) in his day.I also purchased this pint of [Jack Daniels](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/returning-to-pdx.html), in part to commiserate regarding [the drought](http://www.wbko.com/news/headlines/7955482.html), and its impact on the factory. Sure, there's lots in the pipeline already, but we'd rather the well not go dry.
