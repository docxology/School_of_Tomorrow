I'm sometimes called "expat" but that's when I was living outside the country (exterior to the homeland, where the "pats" or patriots live). I've been "back home" (but not in Chicago) since the 1970s which is a long time ago, so nowadays I blend in as perfectly normal, except for the token Bob Dobbs face here and there (a symbol of my lingering abnormalcy, actually a badge as I'm still proud of not being a "pure" homelander -- many in Congress have never seen much of the world, and it shows).
