I'm working fiendishly on too many projects, risk burn out.  What keeps me going sometimes is a good laugh, and I don't find just anything funny.

For example, sitcoms with [laugh tracks](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/about-earthala-tv.html) tend to rub me the wrong way, as do [aircraft carriers](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/carrier-movie-review.html) for some reason, although I understand they must have sex appeal in some circles, plus I'm a little jealous [of Harry](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/04/rave-review.html), who [got to go on one](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/21/earlyshow/series/main4625131.shtml).

However, [Ricky Gervais](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/search?q=gervais) on HBO was pretty hilarious the other night, and I was able to dig up this shorter version of his sketch about Humpty Dumpty, the nursery rhyme of "nighty night book" fame.  I especially like the King's horses part, more drawn out on the version I saw. 

Also, this revised Mary Poppins trailer, making it out to be some kind of [horror flick](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/06/happening-movie-review.html), more [gothic](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/literary-investigation.html), more Stephen King, puts a big smile on my face.  [Aimee](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/tie-die-project.html) liked it too.

I've shared both on Facebook with my Quakers and others.  I'm finding that to be a lively place, a good break from my heavy duty job responsibilities, which have me staring into vast vats of bubbling source code, some of it quite putrid (not saying that's bad, just it's a dirty job some days, like [on Discovery Channel](http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/dirtyjobs/dirtyjobs.html)). 

They're [podcasting](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3087618543/) from [Fine Grind](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/11/geeking-out.html) today, just got a bulletin / reminder, gotta go soon.  Feeling more refreshed.

Cleaning gutters again tomorrow, not [with Matt](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157600269294969/) this time though.

[Yes, Michael](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/shooting-pool.html), I want to be at your birthday party, will send email confirmation.

I hope Tara's enjoying her first debate team experience, somewhere [in Clackamas County](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/deq.html).

Hey, good news, State of Oregon paid me back $60 after I paid that [traffic ticket](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2990484894/), no contest.  I should go cash it, need the dough, or maybe Congress will give me that bridge loan (joke).

[My friend D.W.](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/scholarly-meetup.html) said he might be making it back up here.  I'm in line to see [his Bucky play](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/opening-night.html) again, get something different every time I go.
