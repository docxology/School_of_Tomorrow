This question is a no-brainer for most of us, given the national deficit (versus debt) as a percentage of GDP is still considered acceptable.  The US is not Greece.  Those measuring solvency as a concept need look no further.  Nations are debt payers for the most part, in [this New World Order](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/11/new-world-order.html), a handy source of interest income.  The name of the game is to keep it that way.

Those seeking to debate for the other team will need to dig deeper in search of arguments.  They will have to argue in terms of ideals, suggesting, perhaps, that the [military-industrial complex](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html) is a pretender, having hollowed out the original core and replaced it with a new operating system.  Instead of directly arguing the US is insolvent, this team might argue the US we have today is a fake, a facsimile, a phony.  "Whatever it is we're calling solvent, it's not the USA" could be their approach.

The latter line might perhaps gain some traction.  The life support on which Uncle Sam has been placed bespeaks a new chapter wherein nation-states in general have lost much of their believability as moral beacons, standing for higher ideals.  Certainly the map of the Middle East has become hard to draw, Syria having crumbled.  The game of asserting sovereignty by enforcing borders looks like a no win proposition.  In the meantime, the population flees.

How close are we to internal refugee displacements reminiscent of Syria?  Should we blame "global warming" for the shut off of potable water in the heartland?  Flint, Michigan decided to encourage residents to imbibe toxins, while many in Detroit are simply losing access.  Local government is walking away from the challenge of providing for the people.  The money the US borrows is more intended to pay for carnage overseas than to provide for essential services.  In that sense, then, "the USA we have known is bankrupt and extinct" (to quote a famous [Medal of Freedom winner](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/forced-march.html)).

The people do become restless when it appears the government is turning against them, now the servant of alien ideologies.  Reassurances that the Constitution and Declaration of Independence are somehow being defended fail to mollify. 

Will [the National Guard](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/05/from_tanks_to_rocket_launchers.html) bring Flint some relief, in the form of potable drinking water?  Citizens have been calling for that.  Instead, the US Army (and National Guard) chose to [conduct war games](http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2015/06/please-do-not-be-alarmed-3167774.html) in the area.  I understand why Jesse Ventura, former Michigan governor, is suspicious.  The presumed demise of the so-called [Posse Comitatus Act](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/04autumn/felicett.pdf) gives our debaters more points to bring up, regarding the possibly phony nature of a post-US imposter.  Meanwhile, [in Flint](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/02/news-we-could-use.html), the free water filters should help.
