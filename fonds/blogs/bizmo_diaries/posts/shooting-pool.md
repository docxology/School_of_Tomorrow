Last night I joined Matt and Mike at the [McMenamins on Savier](http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=52) (recently remodeled) to belatedly celebrate Mike's 48th birthday.  Belatedly because on the blessed day itself (December 16) he was traveling in Turkey with Tina (likewise a Sufi) in the company of his [Mevlevi Order](http://www.hayatidede.org/).We had a meal, then shot three games of pool on one of the two smaller tables, then crossed 23rd to Beesaw's for dessert.  I brought some of my inside-out german chocolate cake home in a box.Michael & Tina also toured in Australia recently, in connection with Mike's career as a [didj player](http://www.fbear.net/).
