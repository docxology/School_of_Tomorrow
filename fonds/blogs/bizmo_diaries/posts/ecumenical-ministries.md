I'm feeling like the chief clerk of EMO these days, not that they have such a position.  That's Ecumenical Ministries of Oregon, my old boss, and sponsor of [Bishop Tutu's visit](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-for-reconciliation.html).

Today, I was in somewhat [Methodist circles](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/methodist-morning.html), explaining [to Bob (Fuller) ](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/04/first-person-physics.html)that I'd met Alex through this esoteric Buddhist cult called FNB, which of course is a stretch.  It's a national organization.  

Our lunch as at [the Cuban place](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5584181036/in/photostream/) on 28th and Glisan, a first for all three of us.  Mom left voice mail from her airplane seat:  off to WDC again.  We'd all been to Burma (me just for a couple days as I recall, on home leave), two of us to Bhutan. I wore a sharks & dolphins T-shirt under a free pile Nike jacket, which become too hot as the weather brightened and warmed.

After lunch I dropped a trailer with cooking gear w/ Jay @ SDW (Episcopalian) before visiting the Daime House (which WW had unceremoniously dubbed the Voodoo House, in a rather parochial snub piece).

Lets be fair though, I really was learning about some esoteric Buddhist stuff in the park, like from a computerist guitarist who'd been sharing the other night (and not someone ordained).  

This was an important API, this part of "the matrix" (rDzogs-chen).

That's when I wrote to Quakers (Los Amigos):

That's one reason I think an FNB binder might be cool:  we get such exotic people coming through all the time.

I enjoy the ecumenical opportunities that this work fosters.  

Learned more about Newar Buddhism and Palden Lhamo today, at the serving.

I borrowed Forest of Visions: Ayahuasca, Amazonian Spirituality, and the Santo Daime Tradition, by Alex Polari De Alverga (translated from Portuguese by Rosana Workman).  I think I'll [take it by Lyrik](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/11/smiley-guy.html) for conversational value.

Speaking of which, I had [a meetup with Jody](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/03/more-qm-in-portlandia.html), the former owner.  I named Fine Grind Productions after her coffee shop, now Lyrik.

I've also borrowed [Complexity: A Guided Tour](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5583591181/in/set-72157625646071793), by Melanie Mitchell.  Melanie is teaching at PSU this semester.  She harkens back to SFI (Santa Fe Institute) and is part of the dynamical systems clique, along with her mentors, [Douglas Hofstadter](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/06/scholars-in-summer.html), and [Stu Kauffman](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/reinventing-sacred.html), the latter one of our ISEPP lecturers.
