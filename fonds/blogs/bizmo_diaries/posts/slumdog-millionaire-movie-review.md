Portlanders lined up at Cinemagic and filled every seat in the house for this one.There's what feels like [superhuman stress and duress](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/incredibles-movie-review.html) in this story, given the bleakness and impossible odds.  The use of flashbacks is effective.This film teaches compassion, and like [a Charles Dickens novel](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/09/please-sir.html) also shows how suffering will twist a human character into something diabolical.I came away admiring humans more than not, but hating their circumstances.  That would seem a productive head space, not too misanthropic.[My morning was productive](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/glass-bead-game.html), in terms of advancing my "4D meme" -- admittedly esoteric.  I'd like my brand of positive futurism [to catch on more](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/campaign-begins-recruiting-talent-now.html) and that requires connecting the dots.
