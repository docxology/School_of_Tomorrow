Excavating one's office can mean a lot of archeology.  I'm vacating a multi-desk zone and setting up shop elsewhere in the building.  It's a business decision.  [Renovations must occur](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/02/reconstruction-phase-2.html).  No one stays in that office except construction workers and me, continuing with demolition (that will be Phase 2).

I've got the Raspberry Pi moved but not yet on the router.  The Airbook is talking to the old Qwest DSL modem.  That's enough to keep me busy.  OK, I've just made sure the Pi is browsing now too.

Melody is at our workplace, checking out the new shipment (from Montana), ordered by Lindsey.  I was out at PDX this morning (airport).
