The embedded version has its limitations. Try [this version](https://www.codesters.com/preview/35d8f674e0454245b65da92973479357/) instead? These are [fun experiments](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/01/embedded-codester-apps.html).

I have one baseball and want to completely surround it with others.
One way: put six around the center one on a table, then three on
top, three on the bottom. With real baseballs, this would be difficult.
