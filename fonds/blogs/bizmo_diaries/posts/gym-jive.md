I finally got to the new 24 Hour Fittness (open 24 hours) and sampled the you-powered rides.  I like riding the elliptical cycle, a standup jobber, while glancing at Comedy Central on a [flat screen TV](http://www.mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4897060).  Unfortunately, I did a number on my triceps, which I'm now nursing with ice packs and Aleve.Other smalltalk:  I never did locate that missing battery charger for the Olympus Stylus 500, so I bought a replacement on eBay, am expecting it soon.  In the meantime:  thank you friends, for allowing me the use of your cameras.
