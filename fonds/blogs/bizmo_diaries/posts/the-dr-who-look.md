My test audience said things like "vintage Kirby" i.e. I make some broad points but then veer off into some world of my own, different planet maybe.

Did he just say "Planet of the Apes"?  Why again?

Anyway, today was Gay Pride day (parade, waterfront festival) in Portland, a ritual and smoothly pulled off.  My mood took me into a rather alien mindset but not in such a way that I couldn't share a sense of celebration.  I wasn't being a party pooper.Â  I was adding to the diversity.

Thanks again to Patrick, Leela, Quinn (the dog) for their company today.  And of course Carol, who sat on the porch through a lot of today.
