What I got out of Wittgenstein: a smooth way to gear shift away from fundamentalist qyoobism a viral ideology leading to lockjaw & paralysis

A fundamentalist qyoobist extremist closes eyes and ears and shouts "nyah nyah I can't hear you" if you question Holy Qyoob's all-greatness.

"Holy Qyoob" pronounced "kewb" and more commonly spelled "Cube" sometimes poses as a "simplest shape" then suffers acute imposter syndrome.

Children are forced to bow down to Holy Cube ("qyoob") by quisling numberphiles. "Kiss the feet of our unit of volume" they insist. Resist!

Once liberated from Qyoobism and its fundamentalist orthodoxies, you will seem anti-normal, a threat. Church of Subgenius offers sanctuary.

Either / Or is the Fallacy. XYZ and IVM namespaces coexist no problem. The goal is to stabilize the cube, not to kick it off stage. Win-win.
