[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/willie3.jpg)photo by Jack Smith, Associated PressAt our little follow-up with Art at The Bagdad, after the [main meeting](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/what-shall-i-do.html) at the Linus Pauling House, I let slip that one of my jobs is to help figure out where to put a SeaWorld in Iraq. Of course that's mainly up to Iraqis, but the requirements of whales and dolphins also need to be considered.Along those lines, Don and I have reached the point of wanting Wanderers open to [non-humans](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/solstice-party-wanderers.html) (we could admit tigers and so on). I don't know what that would look like exactly, especially as we don't strictly define "membership" per se (sort of like Quakers -- [my brand](http://groups.google.com/group/soc.religion.quaker/browse_frm/thread/d03428ec23ef61a7?tvc=1&q=group%3Asoc.religion.quaker+author%3Aurner%40alumni.princeton.edu&hl=en) of 'em anyway).I propose we test the waters by considering Keiko an honorary Wanderer, nevermind that he's dead (that's not a barrier to joining either, I should add).I also put Art in touch with my friend Glenn at [CDI](http://www.cdi.org/) (Glenn and I go back to [IS in Manila](http://www.ismanila.org/)).  I'd stay with him in DC during meetings with [Applewhite](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html) and/or [Pycons](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/03/pycon-2005.html).
