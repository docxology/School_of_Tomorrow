Kirby Urner fell in love with Iverson's APL (A Programming Language) while majoring in Philosophy at Princeton University.He subsequently became a high school math teacher, then a contributing editor for computer literacy text books at McGraw-Hill.  His programming career was mostly in the not-for-profit sector, including as a volunteer in Bhutan.Today he works in the health care sector, and as a curriculum writer and teacher, including for Saturday Academy, one of Portland, Oregon's flagship alternative schools.Kirby's philosophy background led him to explore the writings of American Transcendentalist R. Buckminster Fuller, which have influenced his curriculum writing.  Python and Guido's CP4E have also been major influences.
