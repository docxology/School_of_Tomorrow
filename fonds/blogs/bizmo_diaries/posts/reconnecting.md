[Deke](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/11/object-oriented-thinking.html), aka Lawn Mower Man, aka [@dekebridges](https://twitter.com/dekebridges), with 117K Twitter followers (on that account), very kindly called me up and followed through on an offer to let me use his digital broadcast receiving equipment.

For the first time in like years, I'm getting the channels in real time.  I'd ditched those for satellite, but then in [the great downturn](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/12/dire-straits.html) cut all my expenses, while living on credit and the generosity of others.

Since then, I've regained an income and (a)  restored the gym membership and (b) started treating myself a little more.

I'm still at the frugal end of the spectrum, for a Hawthornite, but not complaining.  Quakers are supposed to cultivate "plain and simple" as virtues.  The house (aka [Blue House](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/02/winter-wonderland-weather.html)) is fully mine, thanks greatly to Dawn's planning.

So I'll be watching more [CBS Evening News](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/mortal-coil.html), just like old times.

In other upgrades:  fitted purple sheets, found in storage, and new speaker wire for the two [dad](http://www.grunch.net/4dsolutions/jackbio.html) bought me many Xmases ago.  He got us the TV then too.  I'm in no hurry to go flat screen.  I get LCDs and HDTVs everywhere I go, so don't mind sticking with my antiques.

I need to return the audio cable though as the phonograph comes with a fixed length white and red.  I don't know what I was thinking buying the six foot cabling.  Fortunately, I still have the receipt.
