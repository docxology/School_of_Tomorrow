FB friend: There seems to have been a dearth of beautiful and innovative tensegrity artwork for decades. Between his new biotensegrity models and these lighting models, Gerald has single handedly advanced tensegrity artwork into the 21st Century. [Facebook link] are photos from the first in-person rehearsal for a dance presentation at the Fascia Research Congress. Gerald shipped all those models in a single piece of checked luggage. I call his design architecture "turnbuckle tensegrity" -- except that all the threads in those struts are right-handed. Turnbuckles would be more elegant, but nobody makes cheap hardware with turnbuckle threading.Kirby, do you know any good candidates for pitching a feature for Make: Magazine on how to design a geometry, acquire the parts, and assemble "tough tensegrity" models? This would really light the fuse to a massive number of load-bearing tensegrity models in the wild.

Me: 

When
 I joined O'Reilly, Make: Magazine was still sharing the same Sebastopol
 building (we got the tour) but was morphing into its own standalone 
business. 

The
 principal there at Maker had purchased a startup named Useractive of 
Champaign-Urbana (run by Trish and Scott Gray (Making Math), University 
of Illinois and Wolfram connections) when still a part of O'Reilly 
management. However by the time the merger happened, and Useractive 
became O'Reilly School of Technology (which is where I came in, as 
faculty), he'd opted out of the chain of command. 

I
 therefore interfaced through OST to O'Reilly bosses without ever 
getting to make solid connections with Make: Magazine and its team.  
I've gone to Maker Fairs here in Portland, hosted by OMSI (industrial 
science museum) and friends, and finally got to 3D print an S module and
 a phi-down version, at a public library, with help from Sam Lanahan's 
chief CAD designer.

Regarding Tensegrity, I don't know if Maker Mag does write-ups or profiles of individual makers, but if it does, an article on Gerald De Jong,
 which includes his software contributions (critical to EIG), would most
 definitely be in order.  Let Gerald share his process with readers. 

Postscript:
 O'Reilly wanted to turn OST from a dot com into a dot edu, but that 
meant getting certified as an academic institution, which process is 
replete with bureaucracy ($$). The uphill battle to become a legit 
university in California proved a budget breaker and we dissolved, after
 a rather fun / wild ride.  I met and stay in touch with some astounding
 people.
