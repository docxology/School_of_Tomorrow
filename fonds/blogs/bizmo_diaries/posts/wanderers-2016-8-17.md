Lucky for us, [Barbara Stross](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/10/wanderers-2007102.html) is dog-sitting and brought the stafford terrier with her to Wanderers today.  We talked at some length about pit bulls.  I shared about the [story on NPR](http://www.npr.org/2016/05/10/477350069/friend-or-fiend-pit-bull-explores-the-history-of-americas-most-feared-dog) I picked up on the rental car radio, when [driving in the mid-west](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/05/immersion.html).

I've always thought we should [embrace non-humans](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/animal-rights.html) as members, not that we have anything so formal as "membership", like the Quakers have.  Dogs should have status.

I'm thinking of [the Ecuadorian constitution](http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/37235-president-rafael-correa-on-empire-and-the-environment), one of the first to assign legal rights to nature, what a concept.  I don't know if English speakers would have ever come to that, probably some would.

We also talked quite a bit about zika in Puerto Rico, and about the state of PR more generally.  The territory was a perch for [Big Pharma](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/02/wanderers-201425.html), enjoying tax breaks.  Steve seemed to know the story there, all news to me.

Then Congress ended those breaks, is that how it went?  How does it work with the [Virgin Islands](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vq.html) again?

I know Belau was enticed into [a Compact of Free Association](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/10/listening-to-women.html) after "getting it wrong" in several plebiscites.  Belau wanted some nuclear free zone provisions the nuke heads on their high horses were demanding be removed.

[Nuke heads](http://4dsolutions.net/mycartoons/cartoon3.html) have a hard time with defiance, especially around nukes and their having them.

We talked about a lot of other things as well.  That's why it's called Wanderers, because the conversation is [like a Ouija Board](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/intuition-and-science.html), but higher bandwidth.

[Patrick and family](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/08/airline-talk.html) are back from Tuscon, AZ.  He and the kids got to tour [Biosphere 2](https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=biosphere%202).  Lucky!
