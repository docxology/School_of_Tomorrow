I've been cramming for days to lead this 3 hour training for GIS professionals at an annual [conference](http://www.orurisa.org/events/gisinact/2005event/). As it turns out, you can't really cover Python in all its glory in 3 hours, i.e. when 5 o'clock rolled around, I still hadn't spent much time discussing how to open and read files. We covered some more advanced topics instead: generators and decorators. Going by partial feedback, at least some in the audience had fun, found me dynamic enough as a speaker. I'm pretty good with quips and asides, keeping things fairly light and moving.But really, today was more an education for me. I soaked up a lot of info about the state of the art when it comes to geoprocessing and geographic information systems (GIS) -- good stuff for a Global Data CEO to know about. ESRI is the 800 pound gorilla in this knowledge domain. They're moving to Python for a scripting language in their flagship product (ArcGIS) which is how come I was a speaker at the Doubletree Hotel, Lloyd Center, Portland.The lunch time talk was excellent. The speaker, [Doug Divine](http://www.pacificsurvey.com/), played a major role digitally surveying both submarines of Civil War vintage (talking USA history here). [The Hunley](http://www.hunley.org/), a confederate vessel, is the one most people know about, but the Yankees had their [own sub](http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/cwnavy/index.cgi?noframes;read=473), which was repurposed to pearl diving duty after the war and ended up all washed up on some island near Panama City. Doug's talk featured a lot of excellent DVD clips, including a dramatization of the Hunley's last mission, funded by Ted Turner.
