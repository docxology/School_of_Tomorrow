I got to sit across from Scott Gray of the O'Reilly School of Technology, over excellent food, cabernet from his county, talking [constructivism](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/about-constructivism.html) versus [objectivism](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1914486&tstart=0).  He expressed sincere admiration for Andre's Crunchy project [and talk](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-March/009187.html).  As the six of us conversed, the hotel dimmed its lights to mark Earth Hour, a global event.  Scott is in the [Jerry Uhl lineage](http://cm.math.uiuc.edu/what) (Urbana-Champaign) and following a productive trajectory. My thanks to Steve, PSF chair, for making this introduction.  I also finally got to meet the elusive (to me)[ Julie Steele of O'Reilly](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3397685205/).  We compared notes on Newark, NJ briefly (she likes it there).

To my right was [Ben Bangert](http://groovie.org/) inventor of hellanzb, a principal Pylons developer etc.  His take on the afternoon's ORM panel discussion was helpful to me.  I enjoy clear expressions of bias (e.g. from Leonard also). Later, I was enabled to crash a party at a nearby hotel.  The PSF legal counsel and I eyed the xBox guitars but I didn't play until later (easy level, higher than beginner) opposite a real pro, and thanks to some Black Label.

We had lots of connections to Iceland in that room.  Insofar as I was able to decipher the chatter, we were multi-user game programmers with rather vast followings.  [CCP is one of the major league players](http://www.eveonline.com/pressreleases/default.asp?pressReleaseID=56).  As [CSN CMO](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/), I was pleased to learn more [about Mochi](http://www.mochimedia.com/) as well.

Ian Benson, Steve Holden and I are planning to brave the light snow and visit Starting with the Universe.  I've got my bag parked at the hotel so I might hop off the El (train) and onto the O'Hare shuttle, looking forward returning to PDX.
