"Back at the Lab" sounds white coaty, but I'm talking [Lucky Lab here](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/lucky-lab.html), the brewpub that does Dogtoberfest (coming right up -- or did it happen already?).  I'd say Sarah-the-dog here is a lucky lab, but then she's also part mutt, as the pro breeders might put it.

Steve and I joined the DemocracyLab table.  Mark and an associate were about to drive to Seattle even at this late hour, for a conference today.  He took us through a demo, where Oregon State's tax income is the focus.  How much revenue is from video poker, lotteries?  Game winnings are not considered a tax, so these numbers were not shown.

Ben stopped over.  We'd missed Duke by a smidgen.

Nate is heading of to [Strata Rx 2012](http://strataconf.com/rx2012) in the Bay Area.  Electronic medical records using free open source software is one of his foci.  That may mean he misses [WhereCampPDX](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/at-wherecamppdx.html), where we hung out last year, OPDX (Occupy Portland) by then going strong.

The Lab was packed with gamers and hackers.  Thursday nights are really big there.
