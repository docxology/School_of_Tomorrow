Typos fixed, [links added](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/63869).--- In Synergeo "coyote_starship"  wrote:> Another meme that makes the rounds is that "conspiracies are bad" i.e.> you'd never want to throw a surprise party, or be in league with some> friends and work to steer the company in a positive direction. No,> those'd be collegial networks among peers, whereas a "conspiracy" is> by definition nefarious. [This FBI guy](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/63868) doesn't seem to have much> immunity to the "conspiracies are bad" meme.>This is where I'd go back to the [memeplex](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/63784) I was hammering on with an influential McLuhanite (newmedia) with Church of Bob connections. [Synergetics Dictionary -> M -> Marshall McLuhan](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/SynergeticsDictionary/SDCards.php?cn=10229&tp=1) gives us a scene wherein Marshall [shows up on Bucky's radar](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/quotable-quotes.html) going "I've read your books, and I want to join your conspiracy". Said in a cheerful, affable style no doubt, with a tinge of mischief.The word "conspiracy", meaning "to breathe with", also has that "piracy" meme embedded (there it is, right in the spelling -- aren't memes fun? not unlike numerology, a sub-branch of memetics). Pirates conspire. Or Pyrates.Now here in Portland, [we like Pirates](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/yar.html), think they're cool, might dress and [talk like pirates](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/adventures-in-radio-land-part-2.html) on some days. So we might like conspiracies too then? Let's say we do. A radical bookstore [like Laughing Horse](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/03/back-at-laughing-horse.html) is where people are likely to know a lot about the [various conspiracy theories](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/63870) ("911 inside job" is a bevy of theories, not just one). They're like librarians, or at least the more experienced ones are. More like Giles or the female equivalent [in Buffy the Vampire Slayer](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-tv-talk.html). Portland as a city is quite well read, with some enormous famous bookstores (Powell's especially, but others too) and a really excellent library system (the on-line stuff works). So it stands to reason that Portland, even without a Library of Congress, is able to serve as a decent intelligence gathering headquarters. Our analysts are nothing to sneeze at.Kirby[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3711555080/)
