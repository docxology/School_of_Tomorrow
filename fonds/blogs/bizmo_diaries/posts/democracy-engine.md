[Introducing DemocracyLab](http://vimeo.com/2740218) from [Vaudevillian Creative](http://vimeo.com/vaude) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/).[DemocracyLab](http://www.democracylab.org/index.html) is harnessing some state of the art cloud computing, a Google app engine, to focus initial user groups. [ I've been lurking](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/09/ppug-200899.html) behind the scenes, marveling at some of the code (it's an open source project).The most current edition is for use with Oregon 150’s Project 2059, designed to enable high school students to create a collaborative vision for Oregon’s future.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhYZ-yJrTkeflVNTQkhqzc8LXIDA9hoALYBSAym_PrpfcKHxtmIflk0xZrYrKDFJn_od78vlI8D_oB-gptEjks4OsYnhTedxnlMbmYmqDaYTV_97tDWKMBs-ranehvina15U5Fp/s1600-h/marks_baby.jpg)
