I just got the book yesterday and have been doing my nonlinear Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics thing, i.e. I've been browsing it.

I've
 always contended studying Bucky's bio is worthwhile because he was so, 
shall we say, gregarious.  He got around.  He was [a mover-shaker type](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/poor-slob-bucky-psb.html).He
 also lived a long time and was a compulsive self chronicler, by 
design.  Guinea Pig B wanted to be studied.  Alec is paying him that 
courtesy.Alec's
 bio also proves my point.  Every page is connecting us to a 
recognizable vista of big name architects, poets, professors and so on. 
 Military types...Great
 story.  It's like a Michelin guide to the 1900s, of course to specific 
circles, an intelligentsia that still persists in some form.Given how thick it is, I understand Alec's not trying to be another Amy Edmondson and recap Synergetics.  He gives readers enough to whet their appetites, and then it's all online.I didn't participate in creating this book.  I see Trevor mentioned, and CJ.  That means I still have my stories to tell, as [Kenneth Snelson's first webmaster](http://grunch.net/snelson/) (BFI's too) and so on.[first posted to TrimTab BookClub GoogleGroup]
