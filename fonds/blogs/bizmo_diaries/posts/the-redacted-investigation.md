I keep going back to [this story](https://www.apnews.com/3187ffc2e9d641f19d61e685f3da9dc2).  Why not pursue?

It'd be like that 
Skripal case, where the accused GRU agents, posing as tourists to 
Salisbury (as if there were anything there) smuggled nerve agent in a 
sealed perfume bottle, latter discovered by hapless dumpster divers. 

Brits saw through their cover story 
immediately, having grown up on John le Carré spy novels and knowing a 
"likely story" when they see one. 

Put all these GRU guys, who supposedly 
jumped to their feet when Trump said "get those emails" (Hillary's missing), on CNN (like 
they did for Osama). 

They'd have to send a team to Russia and true, you're
 not in jail in America where the cowards threaten you even before 
trial.  I don't want sleaze balls getting involved.

The reaction when Putin made 
this offer was "no fair, the president trusts Putin more than us". In 
light of what the president considered a "witch hunt" this was in no way
 surprising. Still, it seems the Mueller 
investigation had nothing to lose by at least gathering more evidence. 
The GRU guys would be confronted with the same forensic evidence that 
convinced the grand jury. 

We could all learn a ton about the technology
 used to leave or remove fingerprints, as when trying to conceal one's 
own moves and/or frame others.  The public has 
proved that it has an appetite for this kind of stuff.  Trump saw a way 
forward with potentially high TV ratings.  Is it really too late?  I
 guess the FBI (special prosecutor) closed the investigation without 
ever caring to actually interview the indicted foreign nationals.  They 
wanted to extradite first, get the alleged criminals into custody, where
 they could be put in solitary and otherwise mistreated (ala Chelsea 
Manning).Obviously the Russians were not about to 
turn over their own military officers to a foreign power on flimsy 
charges, before ever seeing a shred of forensic evidence. 

Dismissing 
Putin's offer out of hand, after the US president said he thought it 
worth pursuing, proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the president has 
very limited power.
