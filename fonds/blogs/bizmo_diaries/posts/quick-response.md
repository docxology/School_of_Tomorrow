It's but minutes before class, me the teacher, however I thought I'd update with this vlog from Natasha. You'll find others of hers scattered through my journals. I've watched her editing skills evolve, in tandem with her many adventures.

My comment on this one (I don't usually comment): @kirbyurner
53 minutes ago I’ve watched a lot of Lex interviews over the years. I know this one was a major achievement for him. Congrats Lex. Some DC think tanks have for many decades promoted Ukraine-involving designs to challenge Russian influence in the region. British too. I don’t believe Putin could have prompted this war simply as a self-serving popularity stunt. He needed to tap into the deeply engrained paranoia of the populace. His opponents made that easy. There’s lots of momentum behind these unfortunate developments going back to WW2.
