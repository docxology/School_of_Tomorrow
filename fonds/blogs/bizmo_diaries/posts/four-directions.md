A lot of bellyaching goes on with regards to this concept of "cultural appropriation". I do agree that one culture may seize upon the memes of another, and from the standpoint of the originator, the new uses may come across as abuses.  "Are they mocking us?"  Maybe.  I'm not denying the "reality" of "culture wars" per se.

In my ethnicity, we have this idea of "class extends" as in Java.  The equivalent notion of "subclass" gives rise to different mental pictures.  The "extend" is to expand into a wide open space, it seems, wheres "to subclass" since like going inward to create yet a more specialized version of something.  Both connotations have their echo in actual computer programming.

Having done the Wy'East Lakota-based training, with sweat lodges, talking sticks, other accoutrements, especially the Medicine Wheel, I'm thinking to extend it (not steal it) to mean what it already means:  the four directions.  This is not a new thought for me, but perhaps my powers to propagate have amplified over time.

By "four directions" though, I mean "in space".  Paint the four faces of a tetrahedron:  yellow, white, black, red.  Four faces face the fullness of space by dividing it into four quadrants.  We might call this "the arrowhead" and its four points are likewise four pointers, indicative of space's 4Dness.

Wherever three face colors meet, the vertex might be of the missing color.

If made of stretched skin or hide, you'll have the connotation of "drum" and also "resonance".
