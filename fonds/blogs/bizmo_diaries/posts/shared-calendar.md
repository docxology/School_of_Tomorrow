Any member of MMM-PSC may share a calendar with it.  Group participants still need to decide how to organize sharing information amongst themselves.  Just because we all have a calendar doesn't decide which one we share publicly.  Here's one I'm sharing:

Don't be concerned if you don't see much happening.  The Google Calendar and the whole idea of a listserv where just proposals in an environment with already-established practices around sharing calendars.  Quakers go back to the 1600s.

A lot of generational torch passing was going on, plus some Friends were even leery of Google.  What can I say.
