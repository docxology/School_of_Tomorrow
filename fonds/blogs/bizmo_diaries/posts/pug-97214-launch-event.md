I showed up [at Lyrik](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/10/from-lyrik.html) babbling about Brazil (Keiko is from there) and toting totems, the PSF snake and a borrowed Moose slipper, for working on another [pro-Perl photo op](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6040277994/in/set-72157627289012973). YAWTDI or something like that. Pythonia (Python Nation) and the Programmers' Republic of Perl are [friendly neighbors](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/07/perl-world.html). When looking at the camel from the right angle, you can see Guido's house in the [background](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/windmills-r-us.html).

One of our troupe. David had [SkyBlue](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/08/fnb-2011811.html). The occasion was a first meetup of the Hawthorne District Python Users Group. HD PUG might work, or perhaps we'll embrace the whole zip code: 97214 PUG. Steve had been talking about starting one, now that he has enough chairs.  We haven't come up with a schedule yet. Last week we attended the big Portland Python User Group [at Urban Airship](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6033847133/in/set-72157627289012973/). Our beginning was auspicious in that we had a successful install-mitzvah with Steve serving as rabbi. I munched on a sandwich and Skyped with our [CSN CTO](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/08/cto-in-pdx.html), also a good Wanderer buddy. Another attender joined us from London, also by Skype. [Flextegrity LLC](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/10/art-of-note.html) was a sponsor for this event.
