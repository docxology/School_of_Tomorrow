We respect "jobs" and "work" enough to pay people to do them, but think 
"study" -- as in "work-study" -- is not work and therefore it's no one's
 job to get educated. Make studying paid work, and you've solved a lot 
of problems.

From current studies:

My small campus tests should 
teach us a lot.  We could have a cash-like crypto and credits in the 
more academic sense, which nevertheless have currency-like attributes. 

Could be that when you join the camp (which is not a prison camp) you 
put your usual wallet (with any outside currency), charge cards and 
phone in a secure locker.  The camp cellphone will come pre-equipped 
with your wallet and apps. 

When you leave the camp in about three weeks
 (average stay for this facility) you'll get your stuff back while 
returning the camp gear (you probably get to keep some samples though 
i.e. a "swag bag" -- product placement is part of the business model).
