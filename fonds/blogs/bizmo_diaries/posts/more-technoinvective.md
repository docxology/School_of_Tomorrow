I seem to have evolved a specialized namespace for use primarily in [verbal sparring](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6217248&tstart=0), often in a public congress, such as an egroup or listserv.  "[Technoinvective](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/technoinvective.html)" was Applewhite's word for it, coined almost ten years ago.Like, today I was going off against BDTs or "big dummy textbooks," the kind you feel like a dummy for lugging around in your bag, while day after day they don't teach you about the [A & B modules](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/incomprehensible.html).I use the A & B modules to fight the control freaks, who also don't like that the Internet (based on tcp/ip) has freed geeks of all ages, and from around the world, to collaborate on open source cyber-curricula that put our dino tree-killer BDTs to shame. [[1](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5256703&tstart=0)]And on the Synergeo list, same thing:  the prospect of yet more traffic jamming in some godforsaken red light district drives me wild: What's to be afraid of is continued dumbing down and no Synergetics in any university philosophy departments, because arrogant physics heads pose as gatekeepers and can't fathom an alternative namespace wherein "4D" would *not* be under their control. [[2](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/29885)]It's not like I want a career in pro wrestling, wearing some spiderman suit.  There're just some corners I need to see turned, before I'll be able to simmer down and remain more quietly brand loyal.These days I'm liking Dido's [White Flag](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dido/whiteflag.html) for an anthem.
