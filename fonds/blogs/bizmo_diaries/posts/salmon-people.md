Glenn say this performance live-on-stage here in Portland, and was impressed.Â  He saved the programme, so I snapped some shots of it (below).

I was glad to find some excerpts on-line.

The performer, Peter Donaldson, is the son of Oregon State's official fish biologist, if I have my facts straight, and became a fish biologist himself, among other things.
