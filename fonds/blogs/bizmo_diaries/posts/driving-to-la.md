Our dinner conversation involved comparing genealogies.  Margaret, Jane and I all have family ties to Switzerland going back one or more generations.  Jane also has ties to the Ojibwa in Canada (a [Hudson Bay Company](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/deq.html) story).The next morning, I updated Joe on some recent AFSC business, plus studied that [NYT business story](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/business/worldbusiness/18kgb.html) on the kitchen counter about how Russian ex-spies are leveraging their experience to play world game, by investing in [Exxon Mobil](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/big-oil.html), Renault... Silicon Valley.Joe filled me in on some local politics involving the railroads, which abruptly terminated freight service to his area recently ("an act of war" [I fulminated](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/12/wanderers-20071219.html)). Oregonians tend to be quite passive in the face of ongoing infrastructure deterioration.Anyway we learned long ago from A Nation at Risk that average USAers don't take threats to their sovereignty very seriously, which explains why they're [being railroaded](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/grunch.html) in so many dimensions.Our drive to Arcata via the Oregon and California coastal highway was very beautiful (lots of redwoods -- very few other cars on the Avenue of the Giants today).Yesterday, in Arcata, I posted some inspired [Python Nation lore](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-December/008377.html). Our solstice celebration was everything I'd hoped, with friends I hadn't seen in many years.Right now, I'm in Ukiah ("haiku" spelled backwards said the graffiti in the mens room), posting from Coffee Critic.  However, it's time to leave.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoVnBM6srcydWfD-XBqJ352gi4p_KFsVCw2VzlLRFZMxIokkHy7ciQ62luhyphenhyphenkDQsJf8K6K-lpUSEUkVwrO8_E__lEEiRbiYcP9_fnVfPeyhv7YoU3Z7Rmr6CDW2B5rIVEgAktN/s1600-h/arcata_bus.JPG)downtown arcata
