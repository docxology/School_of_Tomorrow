My current position on political theater (a main gossip station):

I think I'm OK agreeing that the RT America crowd, at least, was 
impressed with Hawaiian presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as various
 stories alleged.

She's anti regime change wars, pro legalized 
weed (anti Prohibition), pro bitcoin, free Assange and Manning, twice 
deployed, still active duty with the Hawaiian national guard.  Serves in
 Congress.  All good.

I agree with RT America:  there's no one better.  Ergo she has no chance 
in a "mediocrecy" (where media is mediocre).

On the theory that RT America narratives stay consistent with those of 
the Kremlin for the most part, I'll speculate that Putin and his cronies
 likewise admire Tulsi for her principles, despite her relative youth 
and inexperience.

I see nothing wrong with the Kremlin having 
and expressing a  preference through their state-sponsored media channel
 on Youtube.  I'd say it's pretty obvious that's what's happening, 
judging from what I've seen so far.

With all eyes watching social
 media for cyber-manipulation, the best policy is just to state one's 
views plainly.  But then clearly Putin doesn't get to vote, the American
 people do, and Americans are the ones who are pushing Tulsi off stage 
at the moment, because she's a peacenik and for other reasons.  

Americans are also the ones who elected Trump.  I don't buy for a minute
 that a few clever memes on FB or even Podesta emails on Wikileaks, 
could have countered the complacency of the "she's a sure thing shoo-in"
 crowd. I expect less complacency in 2020.

If we can agree the 
Russian government would prefer Tulsi, then we can immunize ourselves 
against the still virulent "Russians prefer Trump" meme, which is a kind
 of cop out surrender on the part of Lower48ers who watch too much 
fictional Netflix about the spy world.

The Trumps were bored at 
that meeting in Trump Tower, about the Magnitsky Act. The Russians 
wanted adult conversation, but the campaigners wanted gossip.  Most 
Americans know next to nothing about the Magnitsky Act.  That's one of 
those adults only topics, not a good fit for the current White House.
