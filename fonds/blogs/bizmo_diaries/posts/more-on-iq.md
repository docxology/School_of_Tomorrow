Back in the early 1990s, in reaction against Mensa I suppose, I created Densa ("There's nothing Densa than Densa"), an IQ club for the rest of us.We'd offer like a 12-step program to Mensa members trying to kick the habit of always feeling like the smartest guys in the room (something [Alex Martelli](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596001886/qid=1137091656) once told me about working @ Google:  it actually came as a relief to not always have to be that -- not in every room anyway (and Alex is a really smart guy)).So in [founding Densa](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=3761917&tstart=0), perhaps I was anticipating (or riding the wave of) the then-emergent "for dummies" culture, with its user-friendly books about some [really tough subjects](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/iq-test.html), like [CORBA](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764503081/qid=1137090531) and [SQL](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764540750/qid=1137090565/)?Allen Taylor (author of that SQL book) [is a Wanderer](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/shanghai-city.html) by the way, in addition to being ultra smart.  He'll be discussing impenetrable networks at our next meeting.
