I'm assuming this "switch" means all my posts to this site to date will be lost, breaking many links. 

If and when that happens, I'll plan to stop my monthly contribution and never post again to the QuakerQuaker site (nor read it either).

From the webmaster:

It's time to move QuakerQuakerEverything's not quite ready, but it's time to move QuakerQuaker over to the new server. It will be powered by BuddyPress, a variation on WordPress blogging platform. It's still very much an experiment in progress, but that's fitting in with the history of QuakerQuaker. I've announced some of the changes on a blog post there:

[Time to switch QuakerQuaker](http://quakerquaker.martinkelley.com/2017/04/time-switch-quakerquaker/)

When the switch happens that site will become QuakerQuaker.org and this will be temporarily Ning.com/quakerquaker until I close it down. Please send all feedback as comments on the new site. I'll be traveling on a family vacation soon and not as available on email. Having everything at one spot will help! 

Also, as I say there, the Paypal account is currently about $30 short (and the vacation means I can't front any myself this month). [You can use the PaypalMe account to help out](https://www.paypal.me/martinkelley). Thanks in advance.
