Yes, they're growing up, expressing more teenage characteristics, but one thing Harry and friends don't seem to do is question authority.The administration summons Harry's best friends off camera, then ties them to the bottom of a lake. Apparently, a rescue is of life or death significance, as Harry goes the extra mile to free a competitor's little sister at some risk to himself (this is a contest see, some kind of sick and twisted Olympic event).Yet no one questions the premise that such cruel and abusive sport is a good use of students' time and abilities. The docile little dummies buy in to all the pageantry.The special effects are spectacular.
