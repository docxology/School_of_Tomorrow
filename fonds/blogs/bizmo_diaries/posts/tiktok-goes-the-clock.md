I had my comment on this vid:  I’m glad Linus went public with his sentiments. Not all Finns are sucking up to NATO so contrary to his statement, it’s far from obvious what his attitude would be based simply on nationality. Part of open source is getting these dirty secrets out in the open.He'd likely take exception to my phrasing, however [we do have Finns](https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00441-2) who take a skeptical attitude towards that state's recent suckering for specific genres of propaganda.[As an Oregonian](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2025/01/oregon-fever.html), I feel I should say this Linus guy isn't speaking for all of us, those of us proudly of [Russian heritage included](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/12/merry-xmas-2024.html) (I'm [more Swiss](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/whats-urner.html) if we go by memes, [Swedish](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/07/july-4-2015.html) if by genes). Many Russian Oregonians with sympathy for those caught up in WW2 era reflexing (i.e. knee-jerk dino thought patterns) were nevertheless hoping the software engineering world was on a plane above such politicized robotics. That was an element in the early idealism of free software more generally, if not of Linux in particular. Linux certainly benefited from the "[cyberpunk](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/08/digital-islam.html)" movement, bringing us PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) and the like. RSA is built in to the HTTPS protocol, since even before Elliptic Curve crypto.But that was then and [this is now](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2024/12/zeitgeist-cartoons.html). Linux is by now the new Microsoft, the behemoth, more button-down and corporate than ever, and more at home simply running things, as the ubiquitous operating system, versus going back to playing the role of youthful idealistic outsider.My own preference is these sanctions (including the Magnitsky ones) be rescinded amidst a return to sanity, such that politicians stop doing harm to [our shared infrastructure](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2022/07/antsy-engineers.html), around which they have very little management competence. Their schools are to blame.Wait, wasn't this supposed to be a post [about TikTok](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2021/06/tiktok-meets-gst.html)?  As of this posting, a nationwide ban is about to occur.Like I said, politicians are poking their knuckles into machinery they were not the ones to either plan or design. They bring their own set of unbalanced biases to the table. I don't wonder that they wipeout often, or that their plans frequently backfire.
