Michael, in business for over thirty years [in Asylum District](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/01/interstate-message-traffic.html), as owner of the Blue Butterfly, now bases himself overseas and shows up with a shipment.

Glenn is helping him unpack and set up in the downstairs area of Gold Door.  Michael is friends with the owner.  Good plan.  [Click here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/albums/72157659695824498) for more pictures from both floors.
