I don't have anything especially foolish or foolhardy to say on April Fools' Day.  I will acknowledge "clowning around" from time to time.

Today, on my way down from Mt. Tabor, I dropped by QuarterWorld, a local arcade game palace now for those aged 21 and older, or maybe it was always that way?  There's a bar.

Given the pandemic, I haven't stuck my head in that place for years.  

Dr. D. joined me, his first time in that place, and promptly scored top score for the day one of his old favorites:  Joust.

I didn't play any games this time, but I did have a couple beers, including this brand I'd never tried before: Game On! from Level Beer.
