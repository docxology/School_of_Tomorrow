Here's an excellent slide show [from Maria's blog](http://www.naturalmath.com/index.php?option=com_jd-wp), and not just because she links to [4D Studios](http://www.myspace.com/4dstudios).If you think math is boring, maybe you're not being "[social](http://tizard.stanford.edu/groups/sociality/)" enough.  Think of math as a contact sport  -- doesn't have to mean rough, although when life gets that way, math can help sometimes (or call it computing).And remember to help your partner, don't be selfish. [ Teaching your peers](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/polymorphic-xp.html) is the name of the game (plus let them teach you as well -- they'll learn more by doing it).The teaching is to the teacher, and comes back most to him. -- [Walt Whitman](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/05/coffee-shop.html)[](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/05/coffee-shop.html)
