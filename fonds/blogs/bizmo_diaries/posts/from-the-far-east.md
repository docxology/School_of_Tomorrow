Far east of the Portland downtown (CBD) that is. 

We talked about how "official London" is pretty small, compared to Greater London all around it. [Steve Holden](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/07/oscon-2015-begins.html), whom Trisha asked about, is now working in "official London" on Christopher Street.

Trisha teaches the kind of maths needed by pharmacists, lots of measure conversions, getting amounts exactly correct, lots of stuff I don't know about. 

Trisha was blown away by the poetry grand slammer below.  I'm glad she clued me in.  She introduced me to Logan and more of her extended household at a favorite neighborhood public house.

This was free pool night (as in striking a small white ball with the end of a long stick, on a green table, not swimming).
