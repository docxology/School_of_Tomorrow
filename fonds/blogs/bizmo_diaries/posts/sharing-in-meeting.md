I remember standing up in Meeting once, a big Meeting in Philadelphia, where AFSC corporation members and directors had convened, and sharing something philosophical-sounding, and also arguably dualistic. "The bodies" I was saying "are innocent of any wrongdoing, yet it's them that we punish".

My point was that of George Fox when he said you can't kill the devil with a gun or a sword or something to that effect. Ideologies circulate like viruses, independently of the animal bodies they haunt (infect, control). To counter an ideology effectively should not involve torturing the animals (the human animals) that express this ideology.Â 

My view is somewhat that of medical science and its practitioners who take the Hippocratic Oath (do they do that anymore?). Treating human bodies is distinct from psychotherapy although they're intertwined. An anxious psyche is more likely to run a body into the ground by overdosing it with stress hormones. How mind and body interweave is the kind of problem Oliver Sacks liked to study.

The use of physical torture, such as by bombing and/or deliberately starving, is an expression of our weakness in the psychological realm. We have less success than we would like countering an ideology, and so take up arms against it, and attack its adherents (the infected, the blessed). Outward war, according to Quakerism, is somewhat beside the point, as what we're really trying to accomplish is metaphysical (psychological), not physical (physiological).

"Don't blame the meat puppets for crazy beliefs and the strings they pull" might be another way of saying it, "but do work on curing craziness by inward means". In Quaker jargon, "inward" is versus "outward". "Inward" is the world of psychological modeling and processing. "Outward" is the world of sticks and stones and broken bones.

Outward wars are misplaced (in the sense of inept) attempts to avoid dealing more directly with inward wars.
