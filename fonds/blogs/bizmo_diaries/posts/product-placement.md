I stopped in at Mulligan's in route to Dollar Scholar for [some Hanukkah doodads ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3139842545/)(part of our annual neighborly gift exchange -- amidst latkas (or latkes)), a chance to compare notes with a CIO type.  We're in parallel universes in a lot of ways, up against obstacles, casting about for opportunities.In my preferred future, Columbia Gorge hydropower charges the batteries of [these cool ATVs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/1460326554/in/set-72157602209081561/), some in reality shows, [computer camps with a purpose](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/escaping-light-pollution.html) (and lotsa props). Recruits from around the world, eager for GIS skills, for logistics training, coding skills, rub shoulders with [Pacific Northwest faculty](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/columbia-gorge-recent-history.html), making us more cosmopolitan than ever.  Could be good.  So, who wants to sponsor [and what's XRL](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/recruiting-for-xrls.html) and why don't I speak plain English for a change?  That would be a change.[Speaking of which](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/our-columbia-river.html), apparently the Lewis & Clark Party came pretty close to armed combat with some Originals over the dog episode.  Their Newfoundland, named Seaman (not Scannon) apparently [got itself kidnapped](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/wendy-and-lucy-movie-review.html).  Happy ending though right?  We should have more cartoons, more manga, more anime.  This is a good story, worth retelling with different spins, and not just the dog part.  Tell us about all the fish grandpa, [before the great dams](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/ieee-picnic.html).  Sea lions...  Tell us more about those peoples, [like from Warm Springs](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/09/business-trip.html), where they came from, how they lived.[Happy Hannukkah](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3139829419/in/photostream/)!
