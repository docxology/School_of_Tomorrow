In some ways I'm like a journalist, with name tags like press passes, color coded to denote my rank and/or privileges, plus with these blogs in which to journal.For example, the red tag on the right let me get up in front of the cameras [in Chicago](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/03/pycon-2008.html).  The hand-written [Portland BarCamp](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/05/qyoobin.html) tag (cleverly reusable) merely announces to peer geeks that I'm interested in Python, Toons, Math e.g. [my 4dstudios](http://myspace.com/4dstudios) does mathcasting around Python quite a bit.I don't actually encourage stuffing two CubeIts! in your carry-on, as the 24 MITEs apiece are highly magnetized, might mess with your other media.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj1-RIPImbDwGRjSe95I9PSk8a_aZ3T1sTVMO-cFiDJ4PYhdyJD1AON8D_x5lJ4YDuxCk3NSI7_rGQ0MrKJ7Ff60SORyJDy-bIXE8aSoGZiC22G9Pq-gtRp5LXWNK8KRh-YiRsc/s1600-h/road_show_2.jpg):: close up ::And speaking of "on the road," my uncle Bill Lightfoot was by today, sans the red Aztek, which he'd exchanged for a newer white one.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjh8_gUSH495gop_lS1kdh8rUiBtbF3GesmPJgC475_Js5qx2-Wk_yFEv5cdPv37fC3KuVOiDu8VKzxBSU6RxNHu1jo7EYWFXyC5KlbDaQl-t6aMy0d2z6xBjVVUPJBDQ9qV4IX/s1600-h/uncle_bill.jpg)Happy Birthday Matt, great being included in your family, since age five or six as the neighborhood newbie.  Wonderful seeing all those brothers and sisters again, plus spouses and offspring.
