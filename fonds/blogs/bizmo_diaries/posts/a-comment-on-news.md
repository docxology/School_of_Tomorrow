My take on the VA not tracking suicides story is that VA guy CBS keeps interviewing who goes "Shhh!" is an absolute crack up, one of the funniest men on television.  I'm glad they kept him on.If I were a vet considering suicide and saw that guy on my screen, I might get really mad, throw my shoes at him, kill my television.That'd be a step up, for a lot of guys.[Barney the dinosaur](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/08/couple-of-skits.html) also a scream.
