Vi Hart reminds me of [Amber Case](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/07/oscon-2015-continues.html), another cyber-anthropologist.

Her usually lighthearted Youtube series attracted the attention of John Green and others caught up in a first wave of Internet personalities becoming semi-famous.

Everyone had their own TV station.  A few took full advantage of that fact (I have [a channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr7TZxfhsqbeiQzLnHdgPgA) going back as well, somewhat mathy, where I take up such topics as [hypertoons](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/07/hypertoons-etc.html)).

I say usually lighthearted in contrast to the two below, wherein Vi wrestles with her karma, bravely and honestly, with the slings and arrows taking their toll.  I wouldn't claim to being unscathed myself.  The war has been ugly.

Here's hoping Vi gets back to her naturally cheerful state.  I think it's a sign of the times that a lot of our semi-famous and famous personalities are showing more wear and tear than usual.  That's because we're seeing how things could be pretty good, ongoing.  That's a lot to lose.
