Python insinuates some generators at this point, syntax that has already spread to the [latest JavaScript](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/New_in_JavaScript_1.7#Generators), along with list comprehensions, in turn credited [to Haskell](http://lukeplant.me.uk/blog.php?id=1107301643) no? The languages all swap DNA with wild abandon -- actually in tightly controlled fashion, but still not predictably.Pascal's Triangle and Fibonacci Numbers are part of what go out preloaded on XOs, those "little green monsters" (Shrek colored) showing up in places like Peru, Uruguay... Alabama, any number of privileged homes in North America. The application is called [Pippy](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Pippy) and provides early exposure to Python.
