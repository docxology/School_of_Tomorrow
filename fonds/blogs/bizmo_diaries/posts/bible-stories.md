Thank you Paul.

The story of Noah feeds into the Tower of 
Babel story, as the uniformity / conformity of thought enjoyed by the 
Great Flood survivors was a consequence of their starting over with a 
blank slate so to speak. Noah and Mrs. Noah were the new Adam & Eve.

What humans did not understand owing to their lack of diversity in 
thought, was that their Promised Land is a ball, a sphere, a planet. A 
lot of them still have some trouble with that concept in 2017. It's not a
 closed system in any thermodynamic sense. A star (the campus fusion 
furnace) feeds us energy for free, the basis for ongoing cell division 
and our daily bread.

Noah's descendants were at first under the misapprehension that they 
lived on some horizontal XY plane to infinity, with "God above" in the 
perpendicular Z direction (Z is for Zeus?). What better way to reach God and make a name 
for themselves as a superpower than through the construction of some 
humongous, homogenous skyscraper?

This seemed like normal thinking to them, so great was their confusion already (Babel and babble connect in Hebrew as well [1]).

God knew that a single culture with a single-minded approach would 
think nothing impossible or unrealistic about their foolish skyscraper 
plan. No "new Noah" would arise to prophesy this was madness, because 
they all thought the same way. Besides, had God resorted to another 
flood (having promised not to do so) He'd be facing this same 
predicament in a few generations.

God understood that diversity in thought patterns would guarantee that
 people spread out and around, and come to terms with their being on a 
spherical spaceship (an Ark, likewise once our Eden).

In his mercy He gave us the humanity we have today: diverse, spread 
around, and not organized under one uni-polar pyramid hierarchy. No 
superpowers here folks, just a lot of feedback mechanisms connecting 
hominids by means of various networks, religious, political, economic. 
Don't think of your skyscrapers as containing some single-minded 
illuminati caste that all speaks the same language.Â  There is no "global
 civilization" that traces back to some singular inner circle, much as 
some cabals would love you to think so.
