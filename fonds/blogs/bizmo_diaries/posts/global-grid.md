Surprising how little discussion of a global grid we've seen in the 21st Century, in light of Peak Oil. 

"Historians will write:  The building of a global grid at the beginning of the 21st Century was one of the key elements in the rise of the prosperity of the civilization that we know today."

The video below pointedly skips showing the most lobbied-for grid I'm aware of:  Alaska to Siberia, for inter-hemispheric transmission.  I left a comment.

The main cause for skepticism?  That humans are unable to get along.  That's kind of the point.  Global grid talk is for grownups, not for TV viewers trapped in their mostly-fiction media bubbles.
