Pythonic Math is a subclass of Gnu Math, meaning we use free and open source software as our core math notation ([MN](http://www.cacs.louisiana.edu/~mgr/404/burks/language/apl/camnweb/camn.htm)).We started in IDLE, using it as a calculator but immediately showing off some of the advantages (e.g. 2**10000). Later we imported the math module to show where to get the complement of scientific functions, plus previewed [VPython](http://www.vpython.org/) to assure ourselves of Python's graphical (including graphing) capabilities.[POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/) is also on deck, our ray tracer for stills vs. VPython's real time OpenGL type environment.A core teaching: cartoons like [Shrek](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0126029/) or [Over the Hedge](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/over-hedge-movie-review.html) involve slowly ray tracing each frame using a [render farm](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/lucky-lab.html), whereas interactive games, perhaps even multi-user over the Internet, have to compute all those actions and textures on the fly, while sustaining a reasonably high frame rate: two very different challenges.We practiced [downloading modules](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/) over the Internet into site-packages, importing, editing, reloading.dir(anymodule) helps us explore contents by dumping a list, as does dir(anyobject) where said object might be a [wanderers.Dog](http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/wanderers.py), a [visual.sphere](http://www.vpython.org/webdoc/visual/sphere.html), or some natively supplied type such as a list, integer, string or dictionary. Like dir(1) tells the integer 1 to "spill its guts" about it can do; "oooo, lots of [__ribs__](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/python-pedagogy.html)."Students enjoyed feeding their wanderers.Dog instances various foods via the eat method. Before long we had dogs eating other dogs, as well as pairing to create new dogs (the __add__ method begets a new dog with a hyphenated name).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjl-CIQ-8Y-lqaTgxy6BufKMqDCPwvvr5Tc1GPj8tZVR081y2gllF0ius2jt_-op7ZlLafv-ot4Kb_745tng-1OuYd7gzmY2Bo3t2xN3OG_r0bGasP2KqLyxDu6rx5mslYJ7gYy/s1600-h/dogdialog.png) (click for larger view)After such an intense lexical (left brained) workout, I decided to give 'em a break and projected one of my favorite cartoons: [Warriors of the Net](http://www.warriorsofthe.net/), about tcp/ip, routers, firewalls, corporate intranets versus the Internet and so on.Towards the end of our 2.5 hours, and looking forward to our experiences with VPython and POV-Ray, I went over the basics with polyhedra, per the [RBF concentric hierarchy](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/volume-ratios.html).I explained how I considered this more 2nd or 3rd grade level material, apologized for getting remedial on 'em, but that's just how it is. The pre-computer, calculator-vested K-12 math-teaching ethnicity still clings to its tired/pre-wired ways, leaving students somewhat ill-prepared for 21st century careers in the design sciences.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCDZt36EB3YZx1k-KOHBhOUFVwhuS6TSBTkqyA9zqzTvVO3QJVVIkOGCeRu4A2Bzc8vDlZtOEQ1c0Hs3LBN1D9VVaS-6cVuCruJcR7k0AqJ6vRQR9L7BTDjRdTB7rRqnbN1CS8/s1600-h/whiteboard.jpg) :: whiteboard ::
