I thanked Dick for quoting the passage I was thinking of.That's all that I said.I'm accused of happy talk, but then I was talking about someone else, not me.Fuller was indeed a great source of hope for many people, a great leader in many dimensions. Awesome guy.I'm not trying to come off as "the next Bucky", any more than I'm trying to be "the next Einstein".I'm more into running these little media campaigns to see where they go.
