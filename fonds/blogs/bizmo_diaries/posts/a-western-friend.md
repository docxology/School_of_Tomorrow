Carol Urner (April 21, 1929 - January 30, 2023)Peace Activist 

Her bio as told by me is currently scattered among these many blog posts, however I'm preparing a more gathered telling.  

Carol lived all around the world, accompanying her late husband, Jack Urner whom she met at the University of Washington (Seattle).

I wrote Peace Activist as her line of work, with the Quakers (Religious Society of Friends) her industry, on the online form, for transcribing to the official 
death certificate.

She worked a lot with women, helping them start their own small handicrafts businesses, especially in the Philippines and Bangladesh.  She taught school, wrote textbooks, and participated in democratization and indigenous peoples rights projects.  When living in Cairo, she worked with the famously named Zabbaleen ("garbage people" -- they collect garbage from Cairo).

When in the USA, she worked on various issues with Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).  

She wrote articles for a number of Quaker journals, including at least two Pendle Hill pamphlets.
