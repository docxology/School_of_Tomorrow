In addition to working with world game planners on Global U ideas [around trucking](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/02/trucking-again.html), I'm studying a New Yorker article, Dymaxion Man, about Fuller, published in 2008.

Sure, that's one way to compute the account, tell the story.  New Yorker features a lot of intelligent writing.

No mention of the Cornwall Eden Project, nor of the Epcot Buckyball ("Spaceship Earth"). How does Synergetics relate to the CCP?

No mention of Dr. Arthur Loeb, nor A & B modules, T & E modules (3D printable!).

We'll have exhibits in our World Game Museum, of what the textbooks were ignoring (a basis for ignorance). Lets see how the narrative accounts compute then, shall we?

Is West Point teaching the Bucky stuff at least, sharing our American heritage with high ranking officers?  Scandalous if not. We're investigating. 

A couple comments, from my Facebook timeline:

The
 main literary trope I find regarding Bucky is that he was a failure and
 his inventions didn't fly. Put his awards and degrees, number of works 
published, historical role as "engineer saint", in a pile, and put that 
pile next to any detractor's and compare. 

True, he didn't win a Nobel 
Prize. Is eleven honorary PhDs enough (given for free remember, to help a
 school uphold its own brand)? Elliot Norton chair of poetry at Harvard?
 Patents not just on the dome, but the IVM itself (like if Descartes had
 patented XYZ). 

This guy appears to be a huge success, by objective 
criteria. One of the most successful who ever lived. I think the "he was
 a failure" trope is a projection. People think "the world is still a 
ghetto ergo Bucky did not succeed." Specious. Completely void of real 
thought.

Or was it 47 PhDs? That's what [BFI claims](https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/biography). Depends what "doctorate" means maybe. 

Such a failure right? [Poor slob](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/poor-slob-bucky-psb.html).

After
 being spurned early in his career by the architecture and construction 
establishments, Fuller was later recognized with many major 
architectural, scientific, industrial, and design awards, both in the 
United States and abroad, and he received 47 honorary doctorate degrees.
 In 1983, shortly before his death, he received the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, with a citation 
acknowledging that his "contributions as a geometrician, educator, and 
architect-designer are benchmarks of accomplishment in their fields."
