Re getting more mathcasts on [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mathematics&search=Search) and elsewhere:I, on the other hand, have direct and immediate needs, given my sub- and/or counter-culture doesn't get much of a footprint in K12, thanks to a closed minded math teaching ethnicity.I need vidclips communicating the [angle/frequency distinction](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/terms.html) (4D vs [4D++](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/4d.html)), [A & B mods](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/modules.html) assembling polyhedra with specific ratios, [vector arithmetic](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/quadintro.html),   [Couplers](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/ivm.html), [Fuller Map unfoldings](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/map/dymax.html), global data within [hexapent overlays](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/hexapent.html), octahedron-tetrahedron space fills as used in [architecture](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/octet-truss.html) and   [crystallography](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/xtals101.html), [geodesic spheres](http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&q=%22geodesic+sphere%22) (and domes), sphere packing arrangements, [figurate and polyhedral numbers](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/numeracy0.html), [concentric hierarchy of polys](http://www.grunch.net/ocn/volumes.html), [T & E mods](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/t-module.html), [Euler's Law for Polyhedra](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/do_you_know/polyhedra.shtml#EulerTheorem), [Descartes' Deficit](http://www.neubert.net/DESCarte.html) and so on. The stuff of [basic numeracy](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/alien.html) in other words. [[1](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5401131&tstart=0)]Re vouchers (i.e. using taxes to support private sectarian religious schools):Where I see vouchers I'd hope to also see a massive tax revolt, as patriotic Americans protested the misuse of the state's power to tax on behalf of religious and other private sectarian institutions. Paying taxes to such a regime would go against everything in our founding documents. Such a regime would be treasonous by definition and should not be permitted to use any of the signs and seals of the United States of America. [[2](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5401148&tstart=0)]Then there's this gem from [Al Jazeera](http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/644EDE87-445A-4E95-B9DE-9F8B405C8433.htm): For his part, al-Maliki denied that Iran had any influence over Iraq or any part of the embattled capital Baghdad.He also said Iraq will never allow any foreign control of his war-wracked country. "We have repeatedly said, and we reaffirm once more, that we will never allow anyone to control any part of Iraq," al-Maliki said, when asked about alleged Iranian interference in Iraq."There are [foreign] interferences but any talk about [foreign] control is exaggerated."I'm sure intelligent readers won't miss the irony in having this be about Iran, given which country is currently [rolling tanks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyssjAfNwPQ) through the streets of Baghdad.
