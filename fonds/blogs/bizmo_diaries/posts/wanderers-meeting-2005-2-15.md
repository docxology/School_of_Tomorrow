Some of you may have wondered where this name "Wanderers" comes from.  Terry was thinking of this quote:“Science would be ruined if it were to withdraw entirely into narrowly defined specialties. The rare scholars who are wanderers-by-choice are essential to the intellectual welfare of the settled disciplines.” -- Benoit  MandelbrotToday our presenter, [Steven L. Jacques](http://omlc.ogi.edu/staff/jacques.html) of OHSU, talked about optics in biomedicine, meaning the therapeutic and diagnostic uses of photons on tissues. Most of his talk focused on clever ways of using colored lasers, mirrors and digital filters to tease telling imagery from the body's surface and  innards.
