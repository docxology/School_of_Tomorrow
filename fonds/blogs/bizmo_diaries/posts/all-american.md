What many Russians are officially proposing is a narrative wherein Ukraine's eastern-most provinces (oblasts) voted themselves out of the Ukrainian federation, joining Crimea in affiliating with the Russian Federation instead. 

It's as if eastern Oregon decided to join Idaho. We have some Oregonians advocating for that to happen.

Some ethnicities, including many with legal backgrounds, did not recognize these referenda as legit and so never bought into the idea that Russia then moved to defend its new territories and their denizens against aggressive Ukrainians in charge of the Pentagon and other WDC circuitry. 

Israelis and Ukes vie over the cadaver of Uncle Sam, feeding off his former legitimacy. Kinda gross, let's admit. Their nations are as dead as all of them. The United Nations is by now a corpse show.

Uncle Sam was already bankrupt and extinct in the 1980s but was needed by the Grunch money makers for bailout and legitimizing purposes, so they used clever funeral parlor tactics to prop him up. We've since enjoyed a series of impotus figureheads and a general dumbing down of the public to a more Planet of the Apes level status quo (an idiocracy, some called it).

The Russkies feel they have no one legit to talk with, about bringing an end to the carnage. They need counterparts but the Grunch doesn't have any diplomats to speak of, just (a) spin doctors (like me), (b) posers in fancy pant suits with lapel flags, and (c) chatbots repeating talking points.

Peter Sloterdijk, the German language philosopher, has identified "foaming" as the breakup of broad consensus echo chambers into much tinier bubbles. Broadcasting became narrowcasting. Yet we still need a consensus reality (CR) to gain traction within. A reliable physics engine (P) may not be enough, absent coherent programming (M). U ⋈ MP.

My Americans don't necessarily buy that "space is 3D" either, just to show y'all how much fragmentation has occurred. If you're in one of those mythical top schools, you probably know what I mean. You've been doing some homework maybe.

But then don't we value diversity? 

Wasn't North America originally seen as humanity's best hope for a shared "live and let live" zone?  Indeed. 

That's why we feel safe here, even with the deep state engulfing us and tracking our twisty turns. We're one of those elites, the kind with privileges. We're quite comfortable rubbing shoulders with the so-called powerful.

And no, that doesn't make us "Caucasians" (snicker) or Ivy League (even if I personally went to Princeton, Class of 1980 -- my classmates were diversely divergent).  We're just another literate group that does its homework and values debate. We're very American in our values, maybe more so than you are? Let's argue about it why not?
