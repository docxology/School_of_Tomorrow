What 
saves the institution of membership from degenerating into 
run-of-the-mill cronyism and cliquishness (the common lot of your 
average black box church) is transparency to non-members, i.e. no 
"members only" rituals and initiations. 

This guiding design 
principle puts the non-member in a position to fully "try before buying"
 while placing workflows under permanent "outsider" scrutiny. Members 
feel publicly audited 24/7, and that's actually what public companies 
(non-profits) are supposed to provide, in exchange for their not having 
to pay taxes the same way an ordinary business does.  We're more like 
governments, of, by and for the people. Religious institutions take that
 "nothing to hide" route, and then often hide plenty. However Quakers 
pride themselves on conducting their business openly, as a part of their
 truth testimony.

During my most recent tenure on Oversight, I pioneered having a clear
 policy of inviting non-members to join clearness committees for those 
wishing to become members, even to convene same. I must say some members
 found this highly counter-intuitive. We did always have at least one 
member on said committees, as for purposes of clearness, the candidate 
member should have worship discussion with Friends of both persuasion.

In
 my view there's no other way, outside of transparency, that has much 
integrity. Otherwise you get "members only" signs and symbols and before
 you know it ruling clique mafioso with rank and gradations, handing out
 favors to the most sycophantic, and the whole anti-egalitarian 
hierarchy of an illiberal church, blech (some pastor-led churches may be
 quite liberal in the sense of open source, not saying only unprogrammed
 have a shot at salvation).

You want your convinced Friend / new member to have had the 
opportunity, at least in principle, to have served in any capacity asked
 of her or him, which may include sensitive positions that fully 
exercise a person's talents (e.g. AFSC liaison).  Nominating is free 
to overlook membership in seeking to bless people with opportunities for
 growth that serve the meeting (win-win). Non-members on Finance, 
Property, Oversight & Communications, Ministry and Worship, is more 
the rule than the exception. I know I've shared all this before, but I 
think it bears repeating.

That being said, because we have to map
 to Oregon state legal templates at some level, as a 501(c)(3), we 
reserve some of the fiduciary / corporate roles for recorded members, 
with maybe some rare exceptions. 

That's in keeping with the 
institution of membership's main purpose: to draw attention to those 
publicly identifying as Quakers in some recorded / authorized way. 

In
 theory (I've heard this often) the recorded members are presumably 
taking more risk, like if Quakers get in trouble with the authorities or
 people start spray-painting Quaker stars (red and black) on peoples 
houses. Members get credit for bravery and going to jail first. This 
sense of "going first" traces to olden times when Friends were deemed 
politically incorrect and extremist.

But then we need to remember
 all the not-members and un-propertied, all the slaves and indentured 
servants, who were also brave in lending our Society their integrity, in
 whatever ways open to them.

The not-public Quakers comprise a 
kind of Wall of Stars, of anonymous benefactors who never outed 
themselves (how could they? Maybe I'm a general in some army somewhere, 
yearning for peace, whereas outing myself would be political suicide in 
my position) but supported us behind the scenes nonetheless.  

The
 theme here is respect, earned or by entitlement, and I'm suggesting 
members and non-members are flip sides of the same coin (and I 
understand meetings not wanting to bother with the overhead -- I'm 
thinking more of how to cope with inertia from the past, vs. trying to 
impose an unwanted institution on newer, membership-free brands of 
Friend like Howard's).
