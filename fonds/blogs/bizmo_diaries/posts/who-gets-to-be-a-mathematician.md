Responding to [an essay on Medium](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/given-trends-in-ai-machine-learning-humans-are-coming-to-appreciate-that-in-constructing-and-bdd9fd4c7087):

Given
 trends in AI (machine learning), humans are coming to appreciate that 
in constructing and internalizing any Reality Model (the process starts 
before birth) one is performing intensely mathematical operations, 
updating new “priors” (synthetic a priori judgements) in some Bayesian feedback loop, complete with cybernetic back propagation though many layers of perceptron.

As Kraftwerk so eloquently put it: “we are the [mathematicians]”.

Dr.
 Keith Devlin showed biological life is at bottom a form of mathematical
 computation. Humans claim to do it consciously, as a brain activity, on
 top of a 99% automated metabolism.

Sure,
 universities want their name on the bottle, when the math smells and 
tastes like the real deal. They’re like wine merchants. However I’m 
always willing to accredit the mathematical abilities, properties and 
practices I encounter in so many walks of life. Fine wines come with 
many labels.

English
 majors studying New England Transcendentalism come up against a lot of 
architecture and geometry these days. Their PhD may be in American 
Literature of the 1900s, but that means knowing what the “isotropic 
vector matrix” is all about (1970s metaphysics), and of course 
“tetravolumes”. No, this isn’t mathematics necessarily, but when it 
comes to Reality Modeling, such concepts have utility.
