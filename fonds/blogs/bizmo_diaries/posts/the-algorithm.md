I've also implemented it [in Clojure](https://github.com/4dsolutions/synmods/blob/master/ramping_up.clj) just for fun and suggest on my Youtube channel that students use whatever language currently interests them, i.e. use it as a Rosetta Stone entry.The constant e.g. [288](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-find-the-volume-of-an-irregular-tetrahedron/) or [144](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1329962711#!) (a 2nd root thereof) was already absent from Gerald's version, and returning in tetravolumes was already the goal. I don't claim that wrinkle came in with the Python.Given Python's "duck typing" it's easy enough to use the same source code to use [arbitrary precision inputs](https://qr.ae/pGTO3C) (way beyond floating points in precision) and to use such as the plane nets for A, B, T, E, S modules in Synergetics to get these volumes and to interconvert their expression with [Koski's versions](https://replit.com/@kurner/SandE-Modules#main.py), involving Phi (Fuller avoided using both Phi and Pi in his invented language of Synergetics, whereas adding Phi back in simplifies a lot of the dimensions).I've also been frequenting a certain Wayne Roberts [Principles of Nature website](https://www.principlesofnature.com/number_geometry_connections/areas_of_a_new_class_of_triangle_the_eutrigon_in_etu.htm) wherein he proves how the area of what he calls a "eutrigon" (one or three angles set to 60 degrees) is A x B where A, B are the lengths including the 60 degree angle, and C is the opposite edge connecting A to B. Multiplication is a matter of specifying the two sides and "closing the lid" (adding C). Lengths 4, 3 would give area of 12 etc.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHPxpfHtBqt7ivhr13kMl2qEZcw5-m2K2lfOYXE_MLv0Ec0lWTmo5H7DWFrYFg1-nLYrztsCMZWn49zrp7ooMI_FLISRqgoCqv6bwBjNystGq-1uWk6RGj0XvQO1uA2KhmZD4A/s531/39851434711_c4a65f780b_o.jpg)area in ETUsUsing the same volume formula and treating the unit tetrahedron as analogous to Wayne's "ETU" (equilateral triangular unit), I show the model is entirely analogous i.e. lengths A, B, C from a common corner (picture XYZ corner as analog) give A x B x C as the corresponding volume, once again with a "closing the lid" operation, this time on a tetrahedron vs. a triangle.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO1VmKpNWbnDUUZX6-ShARm-uF4XZGhgoyDSXXH1iFuxhCHhAMjaX5izkSKIkLNslVGLdd3rOlY7wN9AxMO0FN3TfsoCwFt2cpqdH18R4qMQ1d9kKvbDjx8raQUmqmR3rmpZ3S/s1512/martian_mult2.jpg)2 x 2 x 5 = 20Given the fixed angle of the ABC corner (that of a regular tet), the remaining three lengths are already determined and easy to obtain, for the purpose of feeding into the 6-edge-eating formula above.I personally don't need a whole worked out math textbook with proofs + index in order [to encourage](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2021/03/more-wikipedia-talk-on-facebook.html)Â developing coding skills while imagining a reference "sculpture" namely the concentric hierarchy from Synergetics. Your typical arts and design academy, where fluency with computers is baked into the curriculum, would have reasons to include this segment.[](https://en.citizendium.org/images/9/92/Smhierarchyanim.gif)concentric hierarchy
