Our Quaterly Meeting is in session, a little up the slope of Mt. Hood, just off 26 towards Government Camp.  Kids did an easy challenge course for fun, with Tara practicing her camera skills. She took this one of Rachael.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/juniorfriend.jpg)Meanwhile, adults packed the Lodge to hear three panelists, Lisa De Vaney, Ron Marson, and Tina McMahon described their cosmic arcs against a mystics' star map. All of them learn from dreams, not all of them hear voices (except maybe in dreams).I doodled at a table, drawing sacred geometry toons in my school notebook, using these stories for inspiration.Dawn had meant to draw the Seven Circuit Labyrinth for Children's Program, but another guy had the skill and chose exactly the same place for it.  Off that hook, we left early.  We still have a long day.  Dawn also found an Eleven Circuit to finger walk.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/fingerlab.jpg)Trevor and I met at Peet's for another Grand Opening.  In the change for my Pumpkin Spiced Latte, I got a half pound of Colombian beans.Trevor updated me about Robert Anton Wilson, and the outpouring of love and support for this famous author, apparently in his final days on this particular earthly plane and/or level (Tina has questions about levels (don't we all?)).
