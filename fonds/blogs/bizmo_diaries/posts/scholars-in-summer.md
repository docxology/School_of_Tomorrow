If your students are eager to keep up and stay in shape with new topics, suggest puzzles, like from [Martin Gardner](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/heptagons.html) books, or Godel, Escher, Bach by [Douglas Hofstadter](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/posting-via-modem.html).If looking for theme based studies, recursion is always a good one, links to fractals and phi.  Puzzle:  "my whole is to my longer as my longer is to my shorter, so what's my longer's length if my shorter's is one?" (provide a picture?).But without getting so numeric, consider geek lore:  GNU stands for GNU is Not Unix, so the G stands for GNU, a kind of "not joke".  Likewise the Y in [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) stands for YAML, which Ain't Markup Language.Speaking of markup languages, XML and XHTML remain hot, along with JavaScript and the DOM.  I was just running these by some gnu math teachers today in fact, as more topics in [~M!](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/01/m.html).Here's an idea: obtain Periodic Table data in YAML, either as open source or from scratch (and then share it?), or how about graph the bones of the body (which [connects to](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVoPG9HtYF8) which?).The point of these projects is not to create unnecessary tedium or drudgery.  Let students take a lot of time learning about the elements, about bones, including from first person experience in the great outdoors.  Nature guides a big plus sometimes -- your student might become one?Recommended chemistry readings:  [Uncle Tungsten](http://www.oliversacks.com/tung.htm) by Oliver Sacks, Isaac Asimov's stuff (a chemist and fabulous writer). Biology:  Lives of a Cell by Lewis Thomas.  Mathematics:  surf the Web for stuff on phi, fractals and Fibonacci numbers.  Visit [Koski's Kiosk](http://koskiskiosk.com/)?Make sure your students are well briefed on bookmarking, maybe suggest [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/popular/) as an option?  I've certainly gotten value from that service.Note to students:  avail of work freely shared, while showing respect to your peers.  Give back.  Cultivate generosity.  Study [potlatch economics](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22potlatch+economics%22)?  Start a new blog?
