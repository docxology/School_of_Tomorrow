[ His Forest Devil](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/01/day-at-museum.html) is in our Portland Art Museum, plus I snapped this photo of [his V-X-II](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/hunter-art-museum-chattanooga.html) in Chattanooga that time, am the proud owner of [his Barrel Tower](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/05/barrel-tower.html).As Kenneth's first web wrangler back in the day, I studied [his relationship with Bucky](http://www.grunch.net/snelson/) and [his Portrait of an Atom](http://kennethsnelson.net/icons/atom.htm), in addition to his tensegrity sculptures.Thanks to my familiarity with this internationally recognized artist and his work, other noteworthy characters would contact me, including [Julian Voss-Andreae](http://www.julianvossandreae.com/) (a Wanderer), who was later able to meet with Kenneth, as did [Flextegrity's Sam Lanahan](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157607350755934/), first introduced to me by Fuller scholar par excellence [Trevor Blake](http://www.synchronofile.com/), thanks to the Tetrascroll connection ([LaJean](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/search?q=LaJean) just sent me notice of [their new shipping address](http://www.flextegrity.com/)).Kenneth and [E.J. Applewhite](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/03/synergetics-dictionary.html) also had a good meetup, I think in part because they both considered me a loyal friend, thereby maybe helping to heal famous the Fuller-Snelson rift we've all read about (Ed was loyal to Bucky, through lots of storms and stresses).In affording me this opportunity to collaborate on a web site, and in so many other ways, Kenneth has added value and richness to my life.  I am forever grateful.  The guy is as charming as his wife is adorable.On a couple occasions, after staying with Kenneth, I would train up the Hudson to the Rhinecliff station to stay with  [Stuart Quimby and Cary Kittner](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/12/checking-global-data.html), the dymanic duo behind the now defunct Design Science Toys, creators of Tensegritoy based on Snelson's work. Cary, a certified genius, was another early innovator in this emerging field, as was Sam.Stuart, Cary and I worked as a team on StrangeAttractors, which I still sometimes use when [showcasing my art](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/posting-from-my-xo.html) to prospective new patrons (I did the ray tracings on the box and for the instruction booklet -- I also wrote the informative booklet that comes with the glow-in-the-dark Space Ball from DaMert, originally developed [by Roger Gilbertson](http://www.musclewires.com/press/newcat.html), whose "muscle wires" idea is likewise part of the elastic geometry mix).Gerald de Jong's "elastic interval geometry" (EIG), pioneered with assistance from Karl Erickson, [Russell Chu](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/10/esozone-2008.html), other first power users of Gerald's Struck (a Java EIG application), was likewise inspired by the tensegrity concept, and helped spawn a whole subculture of [new software development](http://springie.com/) attractive to artists and designers.I just got a note from Gerald yesterday in fact, pointing me to this open source Python project called [Nodebox | Evolution](http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Evolution), reminiscent of his Darwin @ Home in some ways (maybe check the embedded video at [my studio's MySpace page](http://myspace.com/4dstudios)).I hope I get to New York on business one day soon, where there's lots going on in open source and design science.
