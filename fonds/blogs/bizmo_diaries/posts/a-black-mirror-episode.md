From Facebook:

Asylum
 City was my overture to screenwriters to bring an alternative positive 
futurism to our screens. Americans in detention camps is a nightmare, so
 is Gaza, but do we have the engineering capability to handle refugees 
on a massive scale?

 Engineers would rather we look at 
politicians as the ones in charge. They're the professional scapegoats 
after all. Yet Alphabet is planning new cities (Sidewalk Labs).

Big tech has the smarts and money. DC sells mercenary services and the 
tools of mass murder for a living. Yet we look to DC for solutions? Go 
figure.

 Why don't kids in cages even get to watch cartoons on 
Netflix? Because they're being punished for daring to pursue happiness, 
life, liberty.

The soulless zombie corporations, engineered by lawyers 
long dead, will gladly kill us all in pursuit of profit. English (the 
language) encodes their personhood. No wonder they call it Voodoo 
Economics, the namespace of the walking dead (zombie corporations: we 
eat your brains).
