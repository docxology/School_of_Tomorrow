I haven't had much time to research the news.  Of course what I'm looking for is a quick turnover of [crime scene evidence](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/10/men-without-honor.html), such as the transcript of the cockpit voice recordings.  Every hour that goes by gives the perpetrators time to mess with the evidence.  We know that's incorrect procedure.  Any resistance to turning over the evidence should weigh heavily in the investigation to come.
