To prove: cubocta(f) == 10*f*f + 2 for f>0, or 1 if f==0.We will derive Fuller's formula from first geometric principles, knowing that (f+1)**2 balls in 6 square faces plus (f+1)*(f+2)//2 balls in 8 triangular faces, minus derived amounts for doubly counted edge-only balls, quadruply counted vertex balls, should simplify to our reliable result. Proof:Six Square Faces:6*(f+1)**2 == 6*(f**2 + 2*f + 1) == 6*f**2 + 12*f + 6Eight Triangular Faces:8*(f+1)*(f+2)//2 == 4*f**2 + 12*f + 8Summing these two: 10*f**2 + 24*f + 14Subtract 1x Edge (but not Vertex) balls:10*f**2 + 24*f + 14 - 24*(f-1) == 10*f**2 + 38Subtract 3x Vertex balls:10*f**2 + 38 - 36 == 10*f**2 + 2.QED.The geometer [H.S.M. Coxeter](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/quick-account.html) stated this proof'd be within range of high schoolers, if not sooner, and I think he's obviously right about that.We care about this sequence because it models a growing [CCP packing](http://www.research.att.com/%7Enjas/sequences/A005901), a kind of holodeck we use for a lot of visualizations in science and engineering. It also [naturally occurs](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica2.html) (we know this empirically).[](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/graphics/cubanim.gif)1, 12, 42, 92, 162...Notationally, it's possible to wire up the growing and/or shrinking cuboctahedron (variable frequency) to a volume number of 20*f**3 i.e. [20 where f==1](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/volumes.html).There's not much proof needed to show the efficacy of this [aesthetic design](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/01/synergeo-31526.html), which I use in my [P4E](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/cp4e.html) and [HP4E](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/01/upgrading.html) curriculum writings quite consistently.[](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/graphics/trinumbs.gif)
