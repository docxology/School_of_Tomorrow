This Voice of America [website / blog](http://blogs.voanews.com/all-about-america/2015/08/05/is-america-actually-11-countries/) denied my comment a public presence.

I introduced myself as "third culture" (Rome, Philippines...) and finding [America](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/09/nation-of-writers.html) weird, not unlike Portland.

But no one is talking "Civil War" Marcus (real name?) or rather, we Left Coasties aren't trying to start a fight.  Like we won already OK? [:-D](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/01/funny-story.html)

As a Cascadian, I was simply grateful for WDC's retreating self-importance.  Why not?  Pacific Rim wasn't born yesterday right?

Anyway, a fascinating discussion.  I'm enjoying the science fiction aspects.
