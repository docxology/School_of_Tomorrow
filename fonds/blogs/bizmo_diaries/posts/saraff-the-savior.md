He died at 22, a passenger in a car crash.I didn't know Felipe well, more his dad, Martin, an AFSC veteran and coworker.I experienced pride in my heritage in that room, including [Mayan](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=206&threadID=1476318&) -- whomever built those pyramids in the video. The American experience is one of surreal beauty.Felipe was lucky to draw such a dad from the card deck of life. No wonder he was such a font of pure love in so many lives. He knew to be grateful, as we are grateful to him. Live on, brother.
