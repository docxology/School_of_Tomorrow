[an excerpt fromÂ [a math4wisdom post](https://www.freelists.org/post/math4wisdom/How-can-we-evoke-deep-independent-conscious-deliberate-thinking,1)]Which brings me to a bigger question regarding [Cognitive Frameworks](https://coda.io/d/Math4Wisdom_d0SvdI3KSto/Cognitive-Frameworks_sustt#_luQ2C):  to what extent might we swap out "the individual actor" as the subject of a progression (e.g. taking a stand -- follow-up -- reflect) and swap in "the organization"?If we do this, how do the frameworks adjust?What does it look like for an organization (even a nation) to "take a stand"?[Quakers](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2024/03/about-quakers.html) write "minutes" (pithy paragraphs), as a result of a consensus process.  Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) then lobbies Congress based on what Yearly Meetings record, which minutes in turn reflect the consensus of the Monthly Meetings (the meeting we visited in Portland is a Monthly Meeting -- worship is weekly, but worship for business is monthly).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgLY5ezNH9yKirj5zZRL3LIezZpw5zdry1fICyjx5zeXchQBJX3q8117cZWDco7kA2H_FkCFCqoLopEAT9VoQqbYvrQDFXvDDfN3QLyP0Oyx7zTl2QOnyKzcUJcz4R3N93vcAXCjLznjUunh6zdN0KRjEf5kteJbeOleLbInfJRCWvzdq38eICF/s360/Screen%20Shot%202024-03-15%20at%2011.23.50%20AM.png)
