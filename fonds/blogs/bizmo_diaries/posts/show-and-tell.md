Actually I wasn't the only [buckaneer](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/buckaneers.html) in the room.  Robin, also a [Jay Baldwin fan](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/bworks.html), helped me sustain a public conversation about [hexapents](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/hexa-wuh.html).  She's from my "boomer echo" generation.Also part of this show and tell: [mydroid.py](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/portland/2007-August/000048.html) controlling [Crunchy](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/07/tux-is-alive.html), who performed without a hitch herself.  Earlier I'd been worried about the butt spinner, but then learned in a coffee shop that said spinner is disabled whenever the recharger is plugged in, as a security precaution.[ I'm concluding that [digitalspace's](http://www.digitalspace.net/) new owners are less competent than the outgoing crew.  Like, they're all proud they have level three engineers who can restore broken [default behavior](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/gm.py), which is for .py files to show their contents when clicked on, as the default icon connotes -- proud they can, but really don't have to. From India maybe?  Maybe just seriously overworked.  Maybe there's only one level three engineer for every 30,000 customers.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-zQuBDIZG8-nlx6LUvadwJ5-cxMcQoH8IVxXvkvzNr7pYmLHTq8gSSd0ymkMzyzZBkAZhgQmECTRoywxLFXZPQgWm38ES2gSln6Jz8uMooccvcqBGzqaC1MVm_mF49bi-io8X/s1600-h/darkdaysatdigital.png)]I ended the show with Nelson Mandela talking about the spirit of Ubuntu, a [default inclusion](http://youtube.com/results?search_query=mandela+ubuntu&search=Search) on the Ubuntu Linux distro.The Optoma had more projection duties this morning:  slides from Darfur, presented by Paul Barker, regional head of CARE.  I'll post [some more thoughts](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/darfur.html) in my Control Room on that.
