Now this is one clever film.  I had no idea that Parker Brothers stole Monopoly from the public domain, ultimately from a woman who followed [the economist Henry George](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/12/wanderers-2009128.html) and was communicating the opposite message.  That's hilarious.

A guy named Darrow learned it from a bunch of Quakers and then colluded with Parker Brothers on getting a patent.

This all came out when the inventor of Anti-Monopoly was defending his right to publish his game.

Now that's a story worth spreading far and wide.

The documentary is mostly about the broken US political system, further wrecked by the Supreme Court with its [Citizens United](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/11/occupy-unmasked-movie-review.html) ruling.

The links to a Banksy-like painter of "Monopoly guy" takes us to Occupy, where this symbol often appeared.  Mission:  Occupy.  From Occupy, we move to May Day.

I like using Monopoly Guy for Wanderers, mixing him with a lamp post on a chess board.  He's been drinking a lot and walks randomly as a result, the connotation being [mathematical](http://giantbattlingrobots.blogspot.com/2009/01/random-walk-down-monopoly-lane.html): osmosis, cellular automata and like that.

Well crafted, mixed with street art / PR.  Another good entry on the [Corporate Personhood shelf](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/this-land-is-your-land-movie-review_28.html).
