This documentary is a direct response to the award winning [Gasland by Josh Fox](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/11/gasland-movie-review.html).

I recommend viewing it.

[Phelim McAleer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2697567?ref_=tt_ov_dr) did a lot of homework, starting with Kickstarter.

The director engages in a point by point refutation of the Josh Fox documentary.

I notice there's a Gasland 2 out by now.Â  I haven't seen it yet.

I'm all for public debate about public policy.

The MSM comes in for some severe criticism in this film as well, especially the NYT.
