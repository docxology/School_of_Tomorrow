:: halloween 2009 ::Today has been productive. I got to mess around with several flavors of animal manure: chicken, horse and, inadvertently, dog (on my shoes).This was in connection with urban gardening, an activity I still suck at, being a clueless newbie in so many dimensions. Live and learn.I've been having [some meaningful dialog](http://www.freelists.org/post/wittrs/Wittrs-Re-Philosophers-dodgeball-and-the-drawing-game,1) on the Wittgenstein list, am glad of Sean's facility.Tara had two friends over last night. They enjoyed cooking up a storm for breakfast this morning.I was in the back office patched into a Math 2.0 [WizIQ discussion](http://www.wiziq.com/), featuring chat, web cams, white board, the works. We joined from many time zones, with our anchor in the Middle East this time.Our topic was [WikiEducator](http://mathfuture.wikispaces.com/WikiEducator) and was most informative. I'm hoping to join a team that'll bring more spatial geometry to that wiki, including some of the more esoteric content my company is known for promulgating and producing.Tonight, Halloween, Tara is off with her friends, working a different neighborhood. I joined the Bartons for a delightful dinner, then rushed over the Duke's. Trey is playing with his smoke machine.We have [a videographer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0c8G64uW2U&feature=channel) this evening. Lindsey is delivering a tight and [classic performance](http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=480007428&blogID=518827632). She's in her element. I'm eating onion rings and drinking [Double Dog Dare](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/wanderers-2009818.html) and patching in to the Internet. Duke, the English Mastiff, is the Grim Reaper tonight.Mom isn't feeding the candy habits of young children tonight, has the lights off at home. Like me, she's patching in to the "[2nd world](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/2nd-life-2nd-world.html)", communicating with her spirit network. Boo!
