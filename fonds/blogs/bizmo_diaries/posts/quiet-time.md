I'm in my "tie-dyed freak with dark glasses" disguise, sipping Nilgiri Blue in a local coffee joint, my daughter close by doing some high schoolers' homework.Although I'm working pretty hard today on several projects, this is also a day for pensive reflection, meditation, and thanksgiving.I say thanksgiving because although this is a dark day on the public calendar, most flags at half mast, it was also the day of my marriage to [Dawn Wicca](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/wedding-anniversary.html) under the care of Multnomah Monthly Meeting, in the [Rhododendron Garden's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Springs_Rhododendron_Garden) wedding meadow, on a blustery but not rainy day in 1993, a happy occasion for many nearest and dearest.Mom flew back to Philadelphia today, for AFSC meetings and such.I had lunch with [Chuck and Mary Bolton](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/12/limiting-ball.html), old family friends.  Their romantically situated Columbia Gorge cabin, [since sold](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/04/morning-mail.html), was a favorite hideaway for our family as well.
