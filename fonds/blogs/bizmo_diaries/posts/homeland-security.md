Our library borrowing history might be scrutinized by a Big Brother or Big Sister someday, if we don't legislate our rights to privacy. What little men lurk behind such puppet Big Siblings, claiming rights to scrutinize and do we have the same rights vis-a-vis [them](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/01/total-information-awareness.html)?On the other hand, historians chafe when records are denied them, as their access to history depends not only on good record keeping, but on gaining access to those records.So, as a nod to historians, here's a dump of my current borrowings from Multnomah County Library:AUTHOR: Humphreys, J.
