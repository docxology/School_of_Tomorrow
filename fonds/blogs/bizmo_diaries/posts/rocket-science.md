My advice to fellow Quakers, as a parent, was to stage some fun outdoor activities this summer, like joining a hobby rocket club as an extracurricular activity.Walking my talk, I looked up Tom Higgins [recently](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/04/treasure-hunt-on-hawthorne.html) on Hawthorne, [Trevor](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/around-town.html) too.Apparently the park ranger was very against the idea for this time, talked about calling Homeland Security or something.[Very Norman Rockwell](http://flickr.com/search/?q=rockets&w=82248122%40N00), this idea of boys and girls, parents and pets, having some fun with their homemade cardboard craft, which are supposed to emit a little parachute, so you can reuse the hull, even nose cone if you're lucky.Then everything suddenly goes dark as the "verboten" signs go up everywhere.  We've all seen those movies too.  Usually the Americans show up and rescue us, so this time we're in [a quandary](http://www.answers.com/quandary&r=67).
