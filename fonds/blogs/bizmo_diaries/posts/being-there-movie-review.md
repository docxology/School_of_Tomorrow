[This one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078841/) has withstood the test of time, as I expected it would.  I can't quite say how much I admire this film.Plus it proves my education philosophy:  you can glean enough from television to be a virtual president -- at least if you're Peter Sellers.Shirley MacLaine is likewise brilliant. And Ruth Attaway, as Louise.The levity is high, symbolism deep, the serenity profound (a trully haunting piano).  It helps if you grew up in the period captured (as I did) but really, this film is timeless.I recall reading the book first, by Jerzy Kosinski -- also Painted Bird.
