Hah hah, I went to Laurelhurst Theater's web site and clicked on trailer for Iron Man 3, and got a notice the trailer was blocked by one or more of the content owners.  Blocking their own trailers are they?  Well, never mind about the film then.  I've heard from enough people that this is a miserable / terrible film to just leave it at that.  Fine with me if the "owners" lose money and reputation on this one.
