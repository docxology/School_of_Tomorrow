So I just got back from central coastal Oregon, somewhere between Roseburg and Coos Bay, where there's this camp.  Quakers renting, just for the weekend, men.  Annual event.  Missed it last year. Didn't have a bizmo this time, but Dave's car was quite fun (flip-up headlights).We focused on some writings by James Nayler quite a bit.  I'll have more results to share latter.  Suffice to say now that I used a lot of the time doodling some Qv2 commercials (Quakers version 2).
