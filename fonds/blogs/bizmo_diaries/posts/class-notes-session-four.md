Our Views are VPython's, standing in for a real time game engine, and POV-Ray's, representing a render time ray tracer. Python serves as a Controller, connecting the Model to the Views per user selections.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjY082C2GTR4FCvFdU3gURVKq5opQeBLMHm8The-HpIf9b5q7J4wUDp6-W4OPhf5n_O1s6hhfTeDsXr1f1OQu9oLo_Sv_28uy7UAKopDP1PxzwBkzYbtFt7y9PHYxxycNu6eoOu/s1600-h/handout2of2.png)two views: real time vs. render time(click for larger view)[Viztoyz](http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/viztoyz.py) and [Povtoyz](http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/povtoyz.py) have a lot in common, but are designed as controllers for two different views, a real time and render time view respectively.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgHBnyIMMj030r6ujaW8Vv_cRI21ArN9xdAalVmIbxzNRSD3O5daf8BB0hy5qAX8Dvkdr5XIMGZ4PbfugD-WeGI7ixBnTB_R_flb8zbP8rds9I1C_aUIHuNEdSk-U2oV03XU0t7/s1600-h/icosahedron.png)Python + POV-Ray(click for larger view)I projected from the DVD [Animusic 2](http://www.animusic.com/dvd-info-clips-2.html), including some director's commentary, to demonstrate how render time output might nevertheless by synched with real time music, via some MIDI-to-[Machinima](http://britannicadreams.com/) API. I also recounted my role in the [Understanding Human Motion](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/05/prepping-for-class.html) project, again helping to suggest how render time animations might be helpful in various kinds of simulation.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGaB0o4izxcY54eDRfiCf2HoHtktgo1u0NCCOajFwRzSW7jk1R__foU71_7x-EexTu1qyGKkwPoc7MUQhBB6SIiEmD-jWENvhRHdBbzSrQGFjcTjzBdRnGwJT6KPW_LNQqNWiU/s1600-h/parkingviolation.png)parking violationI keep indulging in this utopian fantasy wherein Saturday Academy instructors are these elite academics with parking privileges in PSU's mostly-empty-on-Saturdays garage (vs. the other one, mostly full). This fantasy has so far cost me $60.
