:: solstice party, December 20, 2008 ::

[The Manger Scene](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/12/holiday-gatherings.html) encourages reflection on several themes: the importance of non-humans in the life of the Spirit; the class equivalence of Magi and Shepherds, when it comes to seeing the Light amidst darkness; Mary as a mother, experiencing joy amidst economic hardship and the real challenges and sufferings of child birth.

I've dwelt on these first two already. Mary's centrality, in birth and in death, is more a theme at the Grotto, an important destination for those into spiritual travel, as [my wife Dawn](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/05/luno.html) was so into. We've frequented the Grotto as a family for many years, or I go there [on sacred occasions](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/grotto.html) with my friends and relations.

Back to my first theme (non-humans): I'm grateful [for Sarah Angel](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3129408676/in/photostream/) today, as she's truly enjoying the snow, wanting to play, even chased her own tail for awhile, just for old time's sake.
