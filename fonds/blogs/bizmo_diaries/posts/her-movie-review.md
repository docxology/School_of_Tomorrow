Way better than I thought it would be.  A pure work of science fiction.  Beautiful scenery.  Gorgeous.  Samantha passes the Turing Test and then some.  I'll be referring back to this movie.

The conjuring of a hyper [Alan Watts](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/10/satori.html) by the OSs won me over big time.

The computer race evolves right passed the body people (us), not to aggressively "take over" (Terminator, The Matrix), but to "leave" as in move to some astral plane we humans don't know about or to which we don't have access until remade as one of them. 

A romantic comedy.  Philosophical.  Great combo.
