:: we're liking this, looking forward to more... ::Not that new actually.  A next challenge is [underway already](http://bfi.org/our_programs/the_buckminster_fuller_challenge/student_team_from_mit_wins_the_100k_buckminster_fuller_challenge_prize_for_their_i).  Should I enter our Coffee Shops Network?  We should be able to attract our own capital given the [vendor / consumer alliances](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/proprietary-games.html) presumed in our business model.  Let's leave the BFI prize money for projects that really need it.  I already got $500 as a Synergetics Explorer Award, along [with David Koski](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/wanderers-2009217.html).
