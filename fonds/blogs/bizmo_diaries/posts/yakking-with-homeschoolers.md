Yakking with home-schoolers [on the Web](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mathfuture/-VBz8X1zSMk/YRodE7R8AQAJ) (hyperlinks added):

I'd never seen Platonic Solid Rock by Dan Radin.  Fun.

Note
 here at 1:36 mas o meno where we get the standard schoolish math re 
Dimension, that his line segments (supposedly 1D) are most definitely 
"lumps" i.e. they have all the height, width and depth one could ask 
for, even as incorporeal narrator informs us otherwise.

That's
 typical in Platonic cartoons:  they say "you will never see a point" 
even as they make the point (pile of chalk dust, usually).  Kids squirm 
uncomfortably and some try to mount some resistance, only to end up in 
the corner, dunce hat on, an example to others who dare question 
authority.

"Points are so small they're smaller than the 
tiniest atom" (quoting some random math teacher) -- yeah, as if they 
existed at all (to say they're Platonic means they're "pre-frequency" as
 we Martians say i.e. they have no energetic content whatsoever).

[With Karl Menger](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/res-extensa.html) we get our "geometry of lumps" and do not distinguish 
line-shapes, point-shapes and polyhedron-shapes on the basis of their 
being "depth only" or "just depth but no width".  No, they're all 4D 
lumps, so-named because the tetrahedron broadcasts 4ness and is 
therefore the canonical representative of Volume (i.e. pre-frequency 
space).

I'm
 into the intersection of mathematics and animation (mathy cartoons). 
Even just this animation about the International Mathematical Union is 
fun:

Note that I am not the creator of [the above](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/02/a-tale-of-two-logos.html).  

I
 like it in part because the IMU explicitly credits Buckminster Fuller 
as a "popularizer" of his "Jitterbug Transformation", which is this 
twist-contraction of a cuboctahedron into an icosahedron then 
octahedron.  

The citation is somewhat ironic as standard 
practice in math circles is to dismiss Buckminster Fuller as a 
"popularizer" of X and Y without ever coming to grips with [Martian Math](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/10/martian-math-storyboards.html).  

I blame the philosophy department as union mathematicians
 are by training clueless about much beyond math (per job description) 
whereas we philo types are supposed to stay more up to date on a broad 
range of disciplines.
