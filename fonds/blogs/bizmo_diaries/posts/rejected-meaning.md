Thanks for your definition of Bizmo!

A few volunteer editors read your definition and decided to not publish it. Don't take it personally!

To understand what definitions we publish and reject, check out this blog post: [http://blog.urbandictionary.com/post/49469679426](http://blog.urbandictionary.com/post/49469679426)

Try rewriting your definition so that it's easier for others to understand, then try again.

Thanks,
