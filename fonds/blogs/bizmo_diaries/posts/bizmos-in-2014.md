I coined the term "biz mo" for "business mobile" in the 1980s to [counter the spin](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/scripting-road-show.html) on "RV" or "recreational vehicle".  If one does serious work for a living i.e. isn't just into goofing off, enjoying retirement, then "RV" is inapt.

The current (July 19) issue of Harper's Magazine has [a good article](http://harpers.org/archive/2014/08/the-end-of-retirement/) explaining how many in my generation are in fact fending for themselves in repurposed RVs, as a migrant labor force of geezers showing up to punch tickets, pick fruit, and do shelving for Amazon.  Move over migrant farm workers, the geezers have arrived (the groups have mingled).

We call ourselves "gypsies" sometimes, which is apropos.  The jobs are sometimes physically grueling, but the optimist geezers see this as "getting paid to work out".  [Shelving for Amazon](http://www.technomadia.com/2010/02/workamping-at-amazon-com-was-it-worth-it/) may involve walking 13 miles a day if they don't give you [a Segway](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/father-still-learning.html), a lot like airport work / study work.
