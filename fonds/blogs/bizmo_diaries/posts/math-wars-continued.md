[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/comicstrip.0.jpg)From some airport departure louge, via wifi:I continue to post to the Math Forum, albeit in a somewhat redundant way, trying to get more Fuller School memes accepted into the surrounding culture -- an uphill battle per usual (I'm very used to this terrain).Like [here](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4584442) (link) Wayne Bishop pooh poohs the idea that there's anything novel within the scope of K12 geometry, since his day in a one room school house some decades back. I again (for the maybe 200th time?) share [what's new](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4585473) (link).  And again, silence.  Laziness?  Complacency? Whatever the logjam, USA civilian culture appears so not ready for this stuff.  I'm hoping the computer science folks in [Baghdad](http://architecture.about.com/b/a/006827.htm) (aka [Algebra City](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/serving-from-algebra-city.html)) will find a more receptive audience in [the Pentagon](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/03/taking-stock.html), given all the [close collaboration](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/03/gnu-math.html) that's going on, in a more difficult military context.Updating from a position near [Fort Campbell](http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/fort-campbell.htm) (March 25):I'll [probe a bit more](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?messageID=4588828) (link).  Wayne replies:  this Fuller School geometry (concentric hierarchy) is "[absolutely, unequivocally](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4588972)" irrelevant to the general student population (link).  His reply brings into sharp, crystal clear relief, my differences with his [Mathematically Correct](http://www.mathematicallycorrect.com/) organization and its ideological fellow travelers.Related reading:[Boosting Bandwidth](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/boosting-bandwidth.html)[Revisiting Geometry](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1388573) (May 26, 2006)[Pentagon Math](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4834994) (June 22, 2006)[Geometry Text](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7022927&tstart=0) (March 28, 2010)[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/buckystampssm.jpg)
