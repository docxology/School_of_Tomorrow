I'm not sharing this because I agree with it, but because I think it 
brings into sharp relief what the wall-builders are thinking: "borders, 
language, culture, that's what defines America, that's what defines 
every nation."

I'd counter that the Americas have never really experienced closed borders 
of the type the wall-builders envision. What the alt-right is pushing is
 an ideal (not yet real) form of nationalism wherein we finally do nail 
down the vision and make borders impermeable (no, not like a cell wall, 
but Savage uses that metaphor).

Kind of like "being documented": we have yet to live in a world wherein 
everyone is carefully documented, birth certificate onward, but we appear to be 
approaching such a world, given IT prowess.

We can imagine it and somewhat need that (universal documentation) to work 
better for the ideology of nationalism and its concept of "citizenship" to
 finally reach everybody, including nomads and gypsies.

Nationalists ardently wish for the nationalist ideology to finally become the 
dominant ideology, whereas I'm more thinking nation-states reflect a 
bygone Victorian Era imperialist world view of another day. That doesn't mean they can't or won't continue to provide core services.

An older globalism is getting replaced with a newer one, with more morphing to 
follow (humans are reprogrammable, our saving grace), which neither abolishes ethnicity nor self esteem, nor pride in 
one's heritage.

Our telecommunications have a lot to do with it. It's 
not telepathy, but it's close.  When nations got off the ground in Europe, around [the time of General Garibaldi](https://youtu.be/A2j_annBp6U), we 
didn't have this layer yet.

[We globalists](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/11/thinking-globally.html) just happen to see more clearly than ever that our species shares a biosphere and 
needs tools (such as [the macroscope](http://www.research.ibm.com/5-in-5/macroscopes/)) to self organize. We're doing our 
best, which may not be good enough, that always seems to be the story line.

Speaking of macroscopes, Glenn caught it right away when IBM embraced the term recently. For Glenn and I, the macroscope meme connects to the hexagons + pentagons pattern of the soccer ball, but perhaps with many more hexagons (higher frequency).  What if any such motifs IBM is considering we're not privy to. A lot of PR has been moving in that direction, sensibly.

Edward Popko's [Divided Spheres](http://www.dividedspheres.com/) is a great primer on spherical surface subdividing.
