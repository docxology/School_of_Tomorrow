Our core presentation was on [Mocker](http://labix.org/mocker), a code testing tool.I stayed late seeking to help a guy with some confusing code.[In the background](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-March/008447.html), I empathized with a Python teacher told to keep certain core concepts off limits in the name of keeping the course introductory.And yet it's harder to master Python if you have to bleep over the part about its being an object oriented language.  What does that even mean?  My advice:  start early with objects.My hope is our brand of college prep math, laced with computer programming, will result in much stronger computing skills among new recruits.
