Shoji references the Kabul dome, discussed below by Bucky.

He also talks about the Montreal '67 dome, Fuller's Taj Mahal.

Earlier, he mentions the DEW line side of the business, which would have included [Ed Popko](http://www.dividedspheres.com/).

Later, he mentions the Union Tank Car Dome, the subject of the brilliant documentary, [A Necessary Ruin](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/10/necessary-ruin-movie-review.html).
