Remember, there was already a SARS outbreak before this, traced by virologists, including the Wuhan Lab, to bat colonies. Bat-derived coronaviruses is today and was before a focus of the Wahan virologists, of course. We were warned years ago that another SARS-like outbreak was very possible. As Nassim Taleb puts it, this was no "black swan" event -- twaz foreseen and foreseeable.So yes, Wuhan was studying coronaviruses, we knew that from the beginning. That's their job. They had joint projects with NSF funded scientists which Trump made a big show of cutting, in a moronic display of awkwardness.So if there was a release of coronavirus by a contagious human, contaminated in the lab, that is not proof of weaponization or gain of function research.Looking over the credentials of [the WHO adviser](https://torontosun.com/news/world/who-advisor-covid-19-pandemic-started-via-a-lab-leak), I am not impressed. Tell me exactly what look like genetic alterations to a naturally occuring bat-borne virus. Let it cross your mind that humans don't yet know enough about viruses to purposely modify their lethality, let alone synthesize them from scratch.
