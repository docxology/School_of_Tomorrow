Although I've resigned from any management responsibilities with Portland Wanderers, I still attend the neighborhood meetings at Linus Pauling House.Tonight I showed up with my projector and flipped through a few items, including a preview of my Chicago Pycon talk.Also, since Barry was telling Peace Corps stories from Brazil, focusing on Manaus and "rubber barons" enamored of opera, I couldn't resist seeking Fitzcarraldo links on Youtube and dredging up the [Klaus Kinski vs. Jason Robards clip](http://youtube.com/watch?v=gTgDXu_Nhys) -- [takes me back](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/search?q=jagger).Bill has been writing a port scanner in assembler and had himself talking to a USB port at home.  But on his Dell Inspiron, the same ports appear inert.Aldona is a Lithuanian name.  Her mom didn't learn English until later, as that Shenandoah mining community had its Lithuanian section, where one could get by in that language.  Good seeing [Steve](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/wanderers.html) again.
