I see others [on YouTube](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/show-tell.html) pulling similar stunts.  My hat is real beaver (like felt), with my name inscribed.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjMl_GSGDt4oHWmFllU4DYAqN-aORT7fci13-QSFZSXjac3pqYzetLL_OrXp4F_C_af5c9pq3DfWa5TuCFwFK7shfLDzc6Y8tSHnxXob3Ao9S5mo2DqHETvVJLyHtTFC021Nyh7/s1600-h/Picture+17.jpg)I mostly produce these self styled pilots for [in-house use](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-compositions.html), as I know other groups have their own [recognized authorities](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/04/national-standards.html), don't need me to tell 'em what [a Coupler](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/new-toyz.html) is, a unit-volume space-filling shape of eight MITEs.I put [each MITE in an octant](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/synergeo-32395.html) of XYZ, all corners touching at (0,0,0), just to get the ball rolling in an analytic [spatial geometry context](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/quaker-geometry.html) (important in [design science](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/12/design-science.html)).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh-viNbxqNLS8Zv001mnODnGjUTnduU8Prc6JoyDfG2vGQ2l-_aK77DHLEmnCo7ZBTt8HcGkDKkoAe5fc210AACHgr4YIUj7buz-rvgoJ897tATHhbI_dqAQm3eNukVxZNEMMiw/s1600-h/Picture+18.jpg)Here was a more esoteric explanation of "[bow tie universe](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/koskigeom.html)" using [a Dorji](http://www.bhutanhandicrafts.bt/index.php?cPath=27) as a prop (works well in this role).The [Homeland Security T-shirt](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/homeward-bound.html) is a souvenir from New Mexico, goes well with the hat and/or sunglasses.
