Once at the [Ecomotion dealership](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157602209081561/), I gravitated to the electric ATVs, babbling about [Project Earthala](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/community-night.html) and how we'll need ten of 'em.Of course I hadn't thought it all through.  Recharging from what power source again?Yes, I'm a little shocked at how immature Earthala still is, my high tech [XRL showcase](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/04/extremely-remote-living-xrl_10.html), somewhere in the Oregon high desert.You'd think, with all the [storyboarding](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/location-scouting.html) and [ToonTown](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/toontown.html) nearby...But then I remember:  North America inherited the dregs of Europe to start with, kind of like New Zealand and Australia did.  Dump all the [basket cases](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-world-movie-review.html) on indigenous peoples, make 'em their problem (a pretty cruel policy).The USA was right from the onset swarming with maladapted religious crazies and the like, not geniuses most of 'em, like those Nation Builders like Franklin (none left like that I don't think -- an extinct species).So I cut 'em some slack (and pray the Russians aren't likewise this stupid).
