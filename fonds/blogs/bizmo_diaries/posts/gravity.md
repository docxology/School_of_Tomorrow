In reading through the Synergetics Dictionary again, under the definition of "gravity" and/or "gravitational field", I'm again struck by what seems to be Bucky's long arc agenda to anchor his meanings to some alien logic, from the standpoint of CERN. 

He acknowledges how physicists see gravity as weak up close, at the micro extreme, where it's dwarfed by electromagnetism, in terms of forcefulness. Gravity comes into its own when swinging planets around stars or stars around galactic centers. 

But then he keeps associating his gravity with tensile strength, so when a new alloy permits yet greater tensive pull per cross-section, he sees "gravity at work" whereas the CERN corpus would predict stronger electro-chemical bonding. He sprinkles talk of Newton's law where established trains of thought would not. He sees electro stuff too, but for him that's polarization that simply adds to gravity's rainbow powers. Gravity is generalized attractiveness.

Perhaps in the sense of "doing more with less" owing to knowledge of metallurgy, there's greater gravity in this picture.  As humans become more metal savvy, they express a convergence with principles, which is what gravity is all about... But that's not what gravity is all about.

In the Synergetics grammar, compression is islanded, special case, tunable, focused, whereas tension tends toward ubiquity. Compression associates with radiation, that which is squeezed out by taut tautologies (exceptionless in nature). Gravity is anti-entropic coherence.  These seem to be the associations Fuller constantly cultivates in the minds of his readers. He seems to be in the business of revectoring "gravity".

Given we nowadays have word2vec and text2vec, we're used to the idea of text getting mapped to vector spaces that encode proximity. King - Man + Woman = Queen. Vectors have been weighted in a multi-polar matrix, depending on what corpus gets used to define them. The analogy with nD geometric vectors remains strong, given maths is very much into metaphors.

Speaking of metaphors, might we say the "gravity" in Synergetics is metaphoric, gluing linear segments, the compression rods, into a tensile sphere? The tensile sphere is Fuller's metaphor for any coherent system of beliefs, one might suggest. It hangs together. For the believer, it serves as a guidewire.

Think how AI uses probability to predict what to say next, likewise following a guidewire to generate believable content.

One of Fuller's favorite memes is about nutcrackers arranged in a spherical pattern with their lever arms towards the surface, gripping an internal nut, or planetary core. The idea is even slight squeezing at the surface translates to enormous pressures deep within, thanks to leverage. Gravity may seem "weak" up close and in the short term, but over the long haul, it might worm itself into a position of greater responsibility. We just need to stay patient.

I'm taking the line on math4wisdom that Synergetics is not a TOE (theory of everything) or GUT (Grand Unified Theory) precisely because GPT identifies TOE with any project to explain and/or unify the "four forces" (not "horses") deriving from the Big Bang: strong (quarks), weak (W, Z bosons), electromagnetic (electrons), gravitational. Synergetics does not try to map itself to this particular vocabulary in great detail, although it does proffer a "tetrahedral Feynman diagram" designating the neutron-proton interaction (e.g. beta decay).

That doesn't mean Synergetics is uninterested in any kind of unification, just that the definitions of GUT and TOE seem too restrictive to contain it. The kind of unification it seeks seems more long term speculative. There's also no direct mention of dark energy or dark matter.

The process of reading in, studying, plumbing the depths of Synergetics, may impart new trajectories and new spins, i.e. may prove influential, however its use of "gravity" is more likely to make waves in a non-STEM semantic space.  

We've seen these ripple effects already with "love = metaphysical gravity" making it into the shared treasure chest of social media memes. A metaphorical gravity keeps the geometry pumped and rounded as a sense container.
