&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Gus&#39;s workshop in Silverton this Saturday, on digital scanning, got me thinking more about the Business Mobile (&quot;biz-mo&quot;), and what might be its business. We already own a cultural stereotype, of nondescript vans used for spying and monitoring. Why not mark them?&amp;nbsp; To chronicle and curate, to survey, is hardly in and of itself evil.&amp;nbsp; On the contrary, that&#39;s what &lt;i&gt;National Geographic&lt;/i&gt; does. We get great pictures, intelligent writing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gus showed us how objects of some thickness, thicker than paper or film, might to effectively scanned. He brought his Mao watch. When it worked, the Chinese leader waved his hand, against a colorful backdrop. The watch scanned at 4800 dpi no problem, with adequate depth of field. Applying some adjustment layers in Photoshop, leaving the original untouched, reduced some of the glints, where red, green and blue had separated on a shiny surface.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My bizmo could have a scanner. Pulling into a place, say near Fossil, Oregon, or somewhere in Utah, means getting ready to curate and chronicle. Why? That depends on the business. This isn&#39;t the FBI looking for criminals, yet representatives in any form of representative government need to study and investigate their own districts, any Chinese emperor could tell you that.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps the bizmo is connected to someone in Congress, and it says so right on the vehicle.&amp;nbsp; That doesn&#39;t mean that someone is piloting the vehicle.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/03/fema-loves-you.html&quot;&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt; needs bizmos to coordinate and communicate, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/images/69376&quot;&gt;no doubt has them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gus talked about the invention of scanning devices, which grew up alongside photography. Until recently &quot;to scan&quot; meant something we did with poetry, an a par with &quot;to parse&quot;. Some of the earliest scanners placed their target document on a drum, a cylinder, still a favored design.&amp;nbsp; Digitizing fragile documents, as a way of preserving them, is an integral part of preservation and scholarship these days. The technology has only gotten better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A high point of Gus&#39;s workshop was when he unveiled &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/12/toontown-revisited.html&quot;&gt;a Homer Davenport original&lt;/a&gt;, purchased on eBay. The paper was way to big for his flatbed scanner, so his solution was to protect the original with clear plastic and then use a hand scanner to digitize in swaths.&amp;nbsp; Satellites in orbit around planets or moons used exactly the same technique, gradually building a complete picture of the target surface through stitching algorithms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to stitching though, lets not neglect the skills of a human operator.&amp;nbsp; Gus adjusted the swaths expertly, applying minute adjustments, such as rotation, as necessary. The result was a very high resolution digitization of the original.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes bringing the equipment to the site, be it contemporary or archeological, is the most practical approach to intelligence gathering.&amp;nbsp; Hand scanners can be a lot less hard on books, then pressing them on the flatbeds when at the library.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m fortunate to have so many magnetic MITEs, enough for a rhombic dodecahedron, maybe two. Most people don&#39;t have those, even math teachers in Finland, so I guess I should stop waiting for the high production values and just get it out there with the terminology.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In these videos I&#39;m introducing some of the tetrahedral space-fillers, such as Mite, Bite and Rite. The Lite is a space-filler, and a Syte, but not a tetrahedron.&amp;nbsp; The quarter Rite, i.e. with a point at the center exploding it into four, is also a space-filler, meaning no left or right handed (very strict).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I go on to show how Sytes face-bond to form volume 1/2 shapes. Koski and I added the Kit to the Kate and Kat. Kit = Lite + Lite.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do I imagine proud geometricians abandoning their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_disphenoid&quot;&gt;tetragonal disphenoids&lt;/a&gt; in favor of these definitions?&amp;nbsp; Not really.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re more into building our own culture than into trying to invade and take over the others. Ethnicities do rub off on one another, thanks to tourism, so some percolation of this terminology, by osmosis, is expected.&amp;nbsp; The A &amp;amp; B modules were original with &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt; and take us into new territory in terms of polyhedron dissections. Then come the T, E &amp;amp; S modules.&lt;br /&gt;

Here&#39;s from my Facebook timeline, posted recently:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/i&gt; was eventually accepted, after Rumsfeld singled it out and some of its journalists were murdered in cold blood. The documentary &lt;i&gt;Control Room&lt;/i&gt; is all about that episode. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
RT right off the bat featured a lot of Americans, some of them familiar, such as Thom Hartmann, a veteran of Air America, author of &lt;i&gt;Unequal Protection&lt;/i&gt;, about how the 14th Amendment was used to finagle Corporate Personhood (if blacks aren&#39;t real people, but might become so, then so may our artificial persons become real as well, only fair (whitey is so forked tongue it&#39;s hilarious)). Jesse Ventura. Interesting characters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of giving Russia credit for adding in a positive way to our media culture, the six corporate media companies decided to circle the wagons and say &quot;we define American culture, not Russians, no way&quot; after which we entered into a Gangland Spy World episode of oligarchs against oligarchs, nation-states trampled under foot. Hard to go back now. We see it&#39;s all billionaire cabals with their politico puppets, so now what? Are we still supposed to hate RT? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forgive me for hating CNN so much but all that build-up to inevitable shock and awe against Baghdad was just so nerve-grating. I&#39;ve hated that network ever since, and will continue to do so. Remember, Jon Stewart was disappointed in CNN too. Then the Dems got all cozy with &#39;em. Because RT is so much better?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Clearly &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/08/chicago.html&quot;&gt;that&#39;s a rant&lt;/a&gt;, and likely some CNN of the future might be the bee&#39;s knees in my book. What got me going were these massive protests in Yemen, regarding the ongoing attacks and blockade, and the helplessness of civilians to do anything about weapons sales to all factions (one of the older stories on this planet). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Not finding any CNN coverage yet. I think RT is waaay more informative than CNN. So much more intelligent debate &amp;amp; dialog. US corporate media is just not edgy or cool anymore. The less of it I watch, the smarter I get.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-dhHrg-KbJ0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like to boast about regional differences, in the sense that Cascadia, home to the Silicon Forest, is pioneering a more useful STEAM curriculum than you&#39;ll find in most parts of the world, including in the UK, which sets the pace for many US east coasters, in the form of standardized testing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But does this regional curriculum actually exist and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/thekirbster/posts/10155108556688965&quot;&gt;what does it look like&lt;/a&gt;? &amp;nbsp;Simply to remain true to its roots, it&#39;ll need to focus on &quot;chips&quot; meaning logic gates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/unicode-anyone.html&quot;&gt;boolean algebra&lt;/a&gt;, ALUs, CPUs, GPUs and all that. Plus &#39;learning to code&#39; will be integral with learning mathematics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; allowtransparency=&quot;true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;402&quot; src=&quot;//scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/152918631/?autostart=false&quot; width=&quot;485&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The above MIT Scratch application, very simple, suggests how we bridge lexical and graphical. &amp;nbsp;The coding environment itself is a mix of lexical and graphical elements, with the language defined in terms of &quot;blocks&quot; looking like jigsaw puzzle pieces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By taking the XY and XYZ Cartesian apparatus of, building on what we learned earlier with figurate and polyhedral numbers ala &lt;i&gt;The Book of Numbers&lt;/i&gt; (Conway &amp;amp; Guy) and &lt;i&gt;Gnomon&lt;/i&gt; (Gazale), we bridge from mathematics to architecture and visualizations more generally. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mere calculators won&#39;t get us there. We need real computers to learn our maths.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We need to embrace 3D printing and CAD skills, and what used to be called &quot;mechanical drawing&quot; (making blueprints).
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_JRZSaF-_cqmDVcK5dG0ciyGfYf7CAT4ZFg1HhkputqS_nEZVcRwX70C8HZlQSP5IxvK3me0zG9k1qw3L3MHj4vAR4rinlxjcizzJzFk0VDzROZgOtYHabnsHlixDZgHeXUKh/s1600/smodule_syn.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;272&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_JRZSaF-_cqmDVcK5dG0ciyGfYf7CAT4ZFg1HhkputqS_nEZVcRwX70C8HZlQSP5IxvK3me0zG9k1qw3L3MHj4vAR4rinlxjcizzJzFk0VDzROZgOtYHabnsHlixDZgHeXUKh/s320/smodule_syn.gif&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/f8813c.html&quot;&gt;Fig. 988.13C&lt;/a&gt; S Quanta Module
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, tetrahedron EFGH above is called an S-module and 24 of them applied to the faces of the internal icosahedron, build this octahedron of 4 tetravolumes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Starting with a smaller cuboctahedron of volume 2.5 and applying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=284575858390621&amp;amp;id=220826461432228&quot;&gt;the S-factor&lt;/a&gt; twice, we get this icosahedron&#39;s volume. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Subtracting this icosahedron&#39;s volume from 4, and dividing the difference by 24, gives the S-module&#39;s tetravolume of (ø^-5)/2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s right, unlike the east coast curriculum, the Silicon Forest is friendly to the Bucky stuff. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
MIT was somewhat friendly, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/SYP8xa&quot;&gt;when Dr. Loeb was alive&lt;/a&gt;, but Boston&#39;s public schools recently chose to go from the Mercator to the Peters Projection, without mentioning &lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/synergetics/map/dymax.html&quot;&gt;Fuller&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe New England no longer appreciates American Transcendentalism (Fuller being the grandnephew of Margaret Fuller, early editor of &lt;i&gt;Dial&lt;/i&gt;), but we do.&lt;br /&gt;

At the university level, we might introduce tetravolumes in a philosophy of mathematics class, as a good example of how different language games suggest different axioms. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine a tribe in which multiplication were presented differently. That&#39;s hard to &quot;imagine&quot; without some concrete example. This Tropical Math YT is the precursor to using three poles, say X, Y and Z. but no longer mutually perpendicular. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Non-Euclidean geometries have already legitimized branching away from Mother Goose Math into alternative territory. This might also be an Art History class where we look at Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember, the meaning of &#39;4D&#39; depends on the namespace:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody _1n4g&quot;&gt;4D as Time: time machine physics ala Einstein / Minkowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody _1n4g&quot;&gt;4D as Spatial in nD Euclidean Geometry: polytope math ala H.S.M. Coxeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody _1n4g&quot;&gt;4D
 as primitively Four Directional (tetrahedron = 4 arrow heads) in 
pre-Frequency &lt;i&gt;a priori res extensa&lt;/i&gt; (American Transcendentalist with 
Lakota influence)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
On a plane (plain), we divide the unit circle into four quadrants with reference to the four compass directions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In zero-G space (an ideal conceptualization) we have four directions of the tetrahedron and the four quadrants of space, per &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/thinking-outside-the-box-dcdd9df4ba69&quot;&gt;IVM &quot;caltrop&quot; coordinate system&lt;/a&gt; (so &quot;4D&quot; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wearewildness.com/four-directions-medicine-wheel-affect-life/&quot;&gt;Lakota medicine wheel&lt;/a&gt; sense).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For hexahedronists, it&#39;s the three-also-six directions of the cube that make the six-spoked XYZ &quot;jack&quot; (so in the XYZ namespace we say space is &quot;3D&quot;).
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I consider &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/05/at-lab.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lucky Lab&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a gateway to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/01/expanding-radius.html&quot;&gt;Asylum District&lt;/a&gt;, named for the mental hospital Dr. Hawthorne helped establish here, under contract from Salem, before the bigger one was built, a star in &lt;i&gt;One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The actors actually checked in and mixed with the patients, to get it right. That building is gone now too, is my understanding.&amp;nbsp; However those seeking asylum still remain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was back to working with Iranian polytechnic academies on Facebook again. We go from tiling (of a plane) to space-filling (of volume) and best Harvard (except for Dr. Loeb) in going with the A &amp;amp; B modules, with lots of links to the relevant literature (Aristotle etc.).&amp;nbsp; Iranians appreciate &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/10/ethnic-schools.html&quot;&gt;American Transcendentalism&lt;/a&gt; by and large. They&#39;re reminded of Sufis and not all Sufis are terrorists, despite Turkish PR these days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Closer to home, I&#39;ve been finishing up Winter Term with the Catholic flagship archdiocese school in Lake Oswego, and Bridgeport Elementary, more likely to have families needing Food Bank assistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m closer to Bridgeport in my socio-economic status, having assiduously avoided the outward weapons trade. As a Quaker, I&#39;d have to shoot myself before buying shares in Lockheed, or put another way, owning any shares in Lockheed would be political suicide for an authentic Quaker like me. Or in Raytheon. Or in Halliburton. We have our standards, our code of conduct.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve steered clear of Alphabet and Apple too (in terms of shareholding, not products or services), as not transparent enough about their back room dealings. I want nothing to do with Beltway Bandits, the scourge of Planet Earth, even if that means eating out of a dumpster (&lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt; rarely resorts to that around here, and if it does, it&#39;s with good cause).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although my &lt;i&gt;Codesters&lt;/i&gt; applications cover prime numbers and closest packing of spheres, those are maybe not 2nd to 5th grade topics in these parts. I was more previewing what we&#39;re learning in Russia and Iran.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;MIT Scratch&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant platform.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Codesters&lt;/i&gt;, a partial implementation of Python 3, is more austere, and a bridge to life on Cloud9 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://c9.io/&quot;&gt;c9.io&lt;/a&gt;) in our curriculum.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s when the JavaScript comes in, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://codepen.io/&quot;&gt;Codepen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had a diagram on the whiteboard in both schools for the parents / guardians, explaining the progression.&amp;nbsp; Kids were feeling somewhat guilty playing games, but I encouraged it, as what better way to harvest ideas and develop motor skills than by game-playing.&amp;nbsp; The two diving boards, low and high, give them opportunities to risk their egos, and make a splash.&amp;nbsp; Some of them did that today, with parents watching.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/33582843665/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;DSCF4106&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DSCF4106&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3759/33582843665_79a086015a.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Karja has put together a complex theory on the rise of order, fitting right in to Wanderers as an &quot;out there&quot; coven of space case cosmologists. Can you say &quot;multi-dimensional&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have a packed house. Lake Coffee developed in micro-time. I recognize Karja as a non-linearist (we&#39;ve met before) so didn&#39;t mind cleaning it up, using a forest of paper towels. Paul Bunyan R Us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That Lake Coffee was in the tiny kitchen with no cooking surfaces (microwave).&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m told the original design featured a dumb waiter (like an elevator) to the larger kitchen in the basement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Steve Crouch coffee maker is a really good one, maybe the best we&#39;ve had (grinds its own) but has more moving parts than we&#39;re used to, plus other idiosyncrasies.&amp;nbsp; A learning curve. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After dealing with coffee station cleanup, I took a far back chair, to blog in real time on my Android. I added polishing touches from the home office later on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I spoke with Patrick about my &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/is-code-school-the-new-high-school-30a8874170b&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Code School the New High School&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posting, a sleeper for now. I was at &lt;i&gt;PDX Code Guild&lt;/i&gt; again last night, for &lt;i&gt;Flying Circus&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Karja&#39;s theory is strongly into a vocabulary around gender, and how that maps to brain wiring in the human form. That&#39;s where the bicameral mind fits in, per Julian Jaynes -- saw him at Princeton -- which I take more as a generic acknowledgement of plasticity in brain wiring over geological time. The details may never be known.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Certainly the software changes a lot, and now is abetted by literal software, which I meant metaphorically in the first clause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rhett Savage is here. That&#39;s exotic.&amp;nbsp; Great to have all these engaged &quot;sovereign individuals&quot; (another theme of the talk).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Battery is getting low on the cell phone, as I blog the talk live.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don is talking about keyboards, echoing some code school themes. Karja is refocusing on the bigger picture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New people keep arriving.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&#39;s pretty cogent I think in her critique of Borg Planet. Wanderers are not polite necessarily, rude Americans. On the other hand we&#39;re here to discuss. She handles herself well in shark-infested waters, so I wasn&#39;t in cringe mode watching some ego get eaten.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Masculinity is the ordering principle... sounds like Apollo (or was it Mars?).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I won&#39;t be doing full justice to Karja&#39;s theory here. Maybe a studio around town will make us a Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She has an interesting take on Instagram; I&#39;m tempted to add it to my inventory of active apps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;d say she&#39;s in the same &quot;final exam&quot; ballpark as R. B. Fuller, and likewise looks to &quot;the computer&quot; with hope more than dread.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She has an interesting take on corporate personhood, if we wanna call it that. #piyemor. Karja sees evidence of active sentience in the cell-silicon whole, distinct from humans. New pattern integrities, more like angels. Digital sentiences. Very Kurzweil in some ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re all thinking about Buzz a lot.&amp;nbsp; We miss his soothing radio voice. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;xg_user_generated&quot;&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;xg_user_generated&quot;&gt;
What 
saves the institution of membership from degenerating into 
run-of-the-mill cronyism and cliquishness (the common lot of your 
average black box church) is transparency to non-members, i.e. no 
&quot;members only&quot; rituals and initiations. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This guiding design 
principle puts the non-member in a position to fully &quot;try before buying&quot;
 while placing workflows under permanent &quot;outsider&quot; scrutiny. Members 
feel publicly audited 24/7, and that&#39;s actually what public companies 
(non-profits) are supposed to provide, in exchange for their not having 
to pay taxes the same way an ordinary business does.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re more like 
governments, of, by and for the people. Religious institutions take that
 &quot;nothing to hide&quot; route, and then often hide plenty. However Quakers 
pride themselves on conducting their business openly, as a part of their
 truth testimony.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During my most recent tenure on Oversight, I pioneered having a clear
 policy of inviting non-members to join clearness committees for those 
wishing to become members, even to convene same. I must say some members
 found this highly counter-intuitive. We did always have at least one 
member on said committees, as for purposes of clearness, the candidate 
member should have worship discussion with Friends of both persuasion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In
 my view there&#39;s no other way, outside of transparency, that has much 
integrity. Otherwise you get &quot;members only&quot; signs and symbols and before
 you know it ruling clique mafioso with rank and gradations, handing out
 favors to the most sycophantic, and the whole anti-egalitarian 
hierarchy of an illiberal church, blech (some pastor-led churches may be
 quite liberal in the sense of open source, not saying only unprogrammed
 have a shot at salvation).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You want your convinced Friend / new member to have had the 
opportunity, at least in principle, to have served in any capacity asked
 of her or him, which may include sensitive positions that fully 
exercise a person&#39;s talents (e.g. AFSC liaison).&amp;nbsp; Nominating is free 
to overlook membership in seeking to bless people with opportunities for
 growth that serve the meeting (win-win). Non-members on Finance, 
Property, Oversight &amp;amp; Communications, Ministry and Worship, is more 
the rule than the exception. I know I&#39;ve shared all this before, but I 
think it bears repeating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, because we have to map
 to Oregon state legal templates at some level, as a 501(c)(3), we 
reserve some of the fiduciary / corporate roles for recorded members, 
with maybe some rare exceptions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s in keeping with the 
institution of membership&#39;s main purpose: to draw attention to those 
publicly identifying as Quakers in some recorded / authorized way. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In
 theory (I&#39;ve heard this often) the recorded members are presumably 
taking more risk, like if Quakers get in trouble with the authorities or
 people start spray-painting Quaker stars (red and black) on peoples 
houses. Members get credit for bravery and going to jail first. This 
sense of &quot;going first&quot; traces to olden times when Friends were deemed 
politically incorrect and extremist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then we need to remember
 all the not-members and un-propertied, all the slaves and indentured 
servants, who were also brave in lending our Society their integrity, in
 whatever ways open to them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The not-public Quakers comprise a 
kind of Wall of Stars, of anonymous benefactors who never outed 
themselves (how could they? Maybe I&#39;m a general in some army somewhere, 
yearning for peace, whereas outing myself would be political suicide in 
my position) but supported us behind the scenes nonetheless.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
 theme here is respect, earned or by entitlement, and I&#39;m suggesting 
members and non-members are flip sides of the same coin (and I 
understand meetings not wanting to bother with the overhead -- I&#39;m 
thinking more of how to cope with inertia from the past, vs. trying to 
impose an unwanted institution on newer, membership-free brands of 
Friend like Howard&#39;s).&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&quot;First Day&quot; is Quaker jargon for Sunday. One spin is our Puritan heritage made us shy away from pagan concepts, such as a Sun or a Moon. God&#39;s people would just use numbers, goes the theory, and in many a database that&#39;s true (the calendrical data gets distilled to an integer).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m fully under the impression today is Business Meeting, an open event, though not in the sense of including lengthy recaps of prior episodes. We don&#39;t interrupt the meeting to do long retrospectives, though that might really help as a Program Committee project. Studying one&#39;s own history (as in medical history) is usually a wise investment, unless maybe hypochondria is your main problem, in which case just let go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of my healthcare stories is dad and I got hepatitis, we think from the corned beef in Ramallah that time, but who knows. We were heading to Florida, having spent the summer in tents, in the outskirts of Rome, and in this small town near Jerusalem, since grown. We banged on rocks with sledgehammers, like in the cartoons, and of our own free will, as peacemakers. AUB students joined us, as did local Boy Scouts (a translation; local adults, mostly men). This was in the early 1970s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dad&#39;s hepatitis got worse and he needed to be quarantined, all while seeking new work in the capital. He&#39;d given several years to the fifty year plans for Libya&#39;s development, not that he was the decider or anything as planning is not like that. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s a process, more like a Quaker business meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve already missed Meeting for Worship, which is weekly (Business Meeting is monthly). I was up late watching the new Adam Curtis film, &lt;i&gt;HyperNormalisation&lt;/i&gt;. I still have time to make business meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely I won&#39;t have much to say as I&#39;m not currently on any of the several committees. I hopped on a welcoming team recently, got to have lunch with the Abbotts, Betsey Kenworthy, Mike Goren (transferring in) but that&#39;s been the extent of it since Peace and Social Concerns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regionally, I&#39;ve been active with IT Committee, both on and off, as clerk and not-clerk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Curtis did &lt;i&gt;Power of Nightmares&lt;/i&gt;, which I&#39;ve always appreciated for its succinct summary, with talking heads. I started sampling it last night again, using Youtube (an Alphabet company), which is what got me plowing through &lt;i&gt;HyperNormalisation, &lt;/i&gt;released prior to the US presidential election in 2016.&amp;nbsp;I&#39;ll get back to it later with a more proper review.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m still eating the &lt;i&gt;Trader Joe&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; Pita Pockets I picked up at the Men&#39;s Group (Willamette Quarter), having secured a supply of hummus upon returning to Portland. &amp;nbsp;Great gathering, guys.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After Business Meeting I might see if anyone wants to grab a beer at either &lt;i&gt;Horse Brass&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Belmont Station&lt;/i&gt;, both near to the Stark Street meetinghouse. Our branch of Friends is not out to reimpose Prohibition or anything like that. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Curtailing human freedoms is not at the top of our agenda, or even in the middle. &amp;nbsp;Quakers formed in many ways as a counter to the overbearing / overwhelming power of faceless institutions, bureaucracies, which in those days was heavily Church of England. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The UK had the New World as a blank screen on which to project new vistas, new programming. Many Quakers chose to pioneer said New World rather than accept their lot in the homeland. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How the story goes from there is rather long, safe to say the Quakers went on to pioneer in the midwest and eventually some got all the way to California, our spiritual ancestors among them. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our Pacific Northwest meeting is pretty cosmopolitan by this point. &amp;nbsp;We don&#39;t have the Unicode name tags yet (for those with names spelled outside of Latin-1) but they&#39;re in the works. All contemporary databases support Unicode.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Addendum (email to old friends, from &lt;i&gt;Hop House&lt;/i&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Good to hear from you Rick. I&#39;m sipping an IPA after Quaker business meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
I
 left early as they wanted to talk about a members-only HVAC system 
fundraising committee, however I&#39;ve rescinded the right of these 
particular Friends to count me as one of their members, for personal 
integrity reasons (their members are too snooty and spoiled, not my 
favorite flavor). Best to quit while I&#39;m ahead. I still count myself a 
Quaker.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
That was awhile 
back, that I dropped my membership. I&#39;ve continued to serve on 
committees and even donate money from time to time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
I&#39;m
 pleased to be back in touch with Tom on related topics of Zero, Origin,
 Vortex (one of your favorites), in addition to the caltrop-based (vs 
jack-based) XYZ-like coordinate system with origin (0,0,0,0).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
He&#39;s the Zero expert. Oregon did sponsor a rock concert named Vortex One long ago. Wikipedia has a write-up I bet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;
Come to think of it, this Hop House still gets Vortex magazine.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The money launderers were at it again today, exchanging their tainted cash for company equities, getting help from a suspect bank.&amp;nbsp; Cyprus may have carried water for a fertilizer enterprise. We&#39;re still watching those tail numbers, to see which private jets rendezvoused where.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although we have no firm evidence Flynn actually Skyped the Russian ambassador, leading to Microsoft&#39;s leaking the conversation directly to Warren Buffet, stranger things have happened. Click here for amazing weight loss facts. How the Vice Principal got the transcript, if he did, is the subject of ongoing baseless speculation, which the NYT will stand by, as Obama had nothing to do with it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The intercepts, while not authorized by a sitting president, were nevertheless a legitimate probe into what might have been a nefarious business, and in the absence of proof otherwise, we&#39;re left at best with a diagnosis of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder&quot;&gt;ODD&lt;/a&gt; or &quot;oppositional defiance disorder&quot; (look it up).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Should the numbers &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/wading-around.html&quot;&gt;prove disqualifying&lt;/a&gt;, an experienced Panetta has reassured us of his willingness to step in and lead us to our destiny, should things get too weird. Or would Colin Powell be our more compliant Smedley Butler and not turn on us this time? Never mind, just business plotting out loud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether this finding of ODD is more disqualifying for high office than ADD (or ADHD for those with trouble following) remains to be determined. The union of neuroscientists is expected to produce a report, rivaling that of NIST&#39;s on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/03/family-feud.html&quot;&gt;WTC7&lt;/a&gt; for the completeness of its final, if surprising, conclusions. Will Puerto Rico be our 51st state by then?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rumor has it that &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/nuts-and-bolts.html&quot;&gt;FEMA&lt;/a&gt; wants you to know if you&#39;re registered to vote or not given all the rumors of a purge of double voters, a number one felony among the least-likely-to-vote. Some true blue, red blooded Americans (buy Cialis) have suggested (recently) that our Democracy of the Stars was in need of some emergency roadside assistance, AAA-style. If in doubt call 1-800-alt-real.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I&#39;m not sharing this because I agree with it, but because I think it 
brings into sharp relief what the wall-builders are thinking: &quot;borders, 
language, culture, that&#39;s what defines America, that&#39;s what defines 
every nation.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;d counter that the Americas have never really experienced closed borders 
of the type the wall-builders envision. What the alt-right is pushing is
 an ideal (not yet real) form of nationalism wherein we &lt;i&gt;finally do&lt;/i&gt; nail 
down the vision and make borders impermeable (no, not like a cell wall, 
but Savage uses that metaphor).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kind of like &quot;being documented&quot;: we have yet to live in a world wherein 
everyone is carefully documented, birth certificate onward, but we appear to be 
approaching such a world, given IT prowess.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We can imagine it and somewhat need that (universal documentation) to work 
better for the ideology of nationalism and its concept of &quot;citizenship&quot; to
 finally reach everybody, including nomads and gypsies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nationalists ardently wish for the nationalist ideology to finally become the 
dominant ideology, whereas I&#39;m more thinking nation-states reflect a 
bygone Victorian Era imperialist world view of another day. That doesn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t or won&#39;t continue to provide core services.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An older globalism is getting replaced with a newer one, with more morphing to 
follow (humans are reprogrammable, our saving grace), which neither abolishes ethnicity nor self esteem, nor pride in 
one&#39;s heritage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our telecommunications have a lot to do with it. It&#39;s 
not telepathy, but it&#39;s close.  When nations got off the ground in Europe, around &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/A2j_annBp6U&quot;&gt;the time of General Garibaldi&lt;/a&gt;, we 
didn&#39;t have this layer yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/11/thinking-globally.html&quot;&gt;We globalists&lt;/a&gt; just happen to see more clearly than ever that our species shares a biosphere and 
needs tools (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.research.ibm.com/5-in-5/macroscopes/&quot;&gt;the macroscope&lt;/a&gt;) to self organize. We&#39;re doing our 
best, which may not be good enough, that always seems to be the story line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of macroscopes, Glenn caught it right away when IBM embraced the term recently. For Glenn and I, the macroscope meme connects to the hexagons&amp;nbsp;+ pentagons pattern of the soccer ball, but perhaps with many more hexagons (higher frequency).&amp;nbsp; What if any such motifs IBM is considering we&#39;re not privy to. A lot of PR has been moving in that direction, sensibly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edward Popko&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dividedspheres.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Divided Spheres&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great primer on spherical surface subdividing.&lt;/div&gt;

The Platonics have been played with for ages. They&#39;re a closed set under the operation of &quot;dualing&quot; i.e. the dual of a Platonic, is a Platonic, the tetrahedron being self dual.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dual(Tetrahedron) is Tetrahedron&lt;br /&gt;
Dual(Octahedron) is Cube&lt;br /&gt;
Dual(Icosahedron) is Pentagonal Dodecahedron&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The self-dual tetrahedron gives rise to the cube and there, with mutual orthogonality, we get phi entering the picture, as mutually orthogonal rectangles supporting the icosahedron of twenty equilateral surface triangles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Borromean Rings may or may not enter the picture at this juncture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The icosahedron, crossed with it&#39;s own dual, yields the rhombic triancontahedron (RT).&amp;nbsp; Hold that thought. It has thirty &quot;wedges&quot; to the center, thirty diamond faces.&lt;br /&gt;

Turning next to the TetraBook, you&#39;ll remember how DB Koski was tilting its page. That&#39;s not the only possible TetraBook by the way. A 2x2 square, three of those corner-intersecting, makes our octahedron, half of which could be a book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, with an isosceles page straight up (angles 45, 45, 90), you have unit volume (1/4 of the octahedron&#39;s total). That&#39;s unit in IVM tetravolumes (vs XYZ cubic volumes).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/01/page-turner.html&quot;&gt;classic TetraBook&lt;/a&gt; has equilateral 2x2 triangular book covers, with one page flapping back and forth, same size. Click stopping at volume stops map(√, (9/8, 8/8, 7/8, 6/8, 5/8, 4/8, 3/8, 2/8, 1/8, 0)) may seem a bit quirky, but at √(4/8) volume, he notes a volume of 4 E3, the same as a wedge in the aforementioned RT.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/03/e-module-mensuration.html&quot;&gt;E3 = √2/8&lt;/a&gt; and 4 * E3 =&amp;nbsp;√(4/8), one of the volume click stops along the TetraBook track. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The notation is such that the RT hugging (shrink-wrapping) a unit-radius sphere is made of E-modules, which scaled up by phi are E3 modules, as volume is upped by phi to the 3rd power when the thing is linearly scaled by that amount.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scaling down by phi is lowercase: e3. We have self-similar E6, e6 etc., going up and down the size spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reducing volumes to canonical assorted &quot;sizes of E-module&quot; is one of DB Koski&#39;s focal points. He&#39;ll do the equivalent with S modules given their simple volumetric relationship:&amp;nbsp; VE:icosa :: S:E (S:E is the so-called &quot;S factor&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The TetraBook track is important for the last two stops, 8/8 and 9/8. Those are the two unit volumes in the IVM and XYZ coordinate systems.&lt;br /&gt;

If World Game were a game show, which game show would it be? Who remembers &lt;i&gt;Family Feud&lt;/i&gt;? Good wholesome fun, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I pondered aloud on &lt;i&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&quot;We&#39;ve
 got billions, we can buy weapons, fortifications, governments... we&#39;ve 
won.&quot; But then there&#39;s the problem of other billionaires (multiple 
cabals) and to what extent do we need the people to tacitly go along. 
It&#39;s starting to look like they don&#39;t miss their democracy and are 
willing to play out their lives within a global plutocracy. Do they have
 a choice? That&#39;s a question.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;Given
 how I&#39;m such a Bucky fan, I feel as an exercise I need to investigate 
in what ways he might have been right in &lt;i&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/i&gt;, about the 
fate of the United States. He saw the cash reserves of the world 
concentrating in the hands of invisible private interests with 
governments left out in the cold as puppets acting out the various feuds
 among billionaires. He called this cash heist GRUNCH (&quot;gross universal cash heist&quot;) and claimed it 
spelled curtains for the nation-state age, as the billionaire fortunes 
are supranational in nature. Given what I&#39;m seeing on the news, this 
1980s &quot;science fiction&quot; is seeming plenty believable. I&#39;m thinking Bucky
 Fuller deserves a place in the pantheon right next to George Orwell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;There I go again, trying to win more points for &quot;da man&quot; and besides, who wants to be the next Orwell? Doesn&#39;t that sound rather grim?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;In
 a lot of ways what I&#39;m interested in is not &quot;the truth of what 
happened&quot; but of generational perspectives thereof (ditto Apollo, which I
 believe happened but record numbers of Millennials have doubts and 
that&#39;s interesting all by itself). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If 0% think 
Oswald acted alone, that&#39;s a fact independent of whether he did or not. 
What people believe is not the same thing as what&#39;s actually so, and I 
may deliberately care more about the former than the latter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m
 saying there&#39;s a generation gap around the NIST report on WTC7 
regardless of what really happened, which helps explain the positive 
reinforcement some politicians are getting for attacking the mainstream 
media (MSM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal opinion somewhat doesn&#39;t matter relative to what I care about (opinion at large).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As
 for how coordinated the conspiracy theory needed to be (the hijacker 
theory is also a conspiracy theory, by definition), given WTC7 was 
evacuated ahead of time and its immanent destruction announced by 
apparently clairvoyant operatives (NIST hypothesis), the decision-making
 network might have been entirely different than the one vested in using
 airplanes, in principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WTC7 was clearly a white 
elephant by 5 pm (extremely damaged) and rubble cleanup would be 
happening anyway, given the fate of the other towers, so why not pull 
the plug on this bystander now, all people out of the area, rather than 
demolish it later? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t have to believe the 
decision to bring down WTC7 was far in advance or coordinated with 
hijackers, only that it was wired to go, who knows how long ago, maybe 
years, knowing all buildings have a life span in Vegas.  If you know the
 key codes, you can blow it. People say that&#39;s unrealistic, but then buy
 that the planet itself is wired to go, and that some president has a 
football to make it happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of football, we&#39;ve getting into the history of the soccer ball over here, thanks to HP4E. The &lt;i&gt;Adidas&lt;/i&gt; hexapent pattern has been popular, however FIFA is standardizing on another way of dividing the sphere. We use common, but also invented, geometry objects to impart generalized principles, such as the Law of Sines and other trig.&amp;nbsp; More from &lt;i&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;, writing to David Koski:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
The TetraBook is a &quot;job&quot; like in Montessori i.e. take it down from the shelf, play with it, put it back. Reshelving is important. Your physical designs for Bridges (ongoing) made sense. I&#39;m not thinking we have to strictly nail what a TetraBook looks like physically, having done the diagrams. Leave that to the designers. Virtual TetraBooks, such as we&#39;ve done already, sit on virtual shelves.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
My students doing real time professional development get a radio-TV show experience, enhanced with live messaging. I&#39;ve worked in other configurations, including in not real time (asynchronously) with O&#39;Reilly School of Technology (OST), but that meant under three days to respond, with source code to eyeball and make sense of.&amp;nbsp; My students had my attention in ways the radio-TV does not provide. A combination of the two might be a next step.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, for now I&#39;m content to suggest projects and provide source code that&#39;s encouraging exploration in several directions. We go against a movie database, check out the API.&amp;nbsp; As of last night, I&#39;m able to check Trimet&#39;s Trip Planner, thanks to Sheri Dover for sharing this part of the &lt;i&gt;PDX Code Guild&lt;/i&gt; curriculum with me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I suggest to self learners around a Python topic would be this three step workflow:&amp;nbsp; anchor yourself in the API&#39;s documentation to where you&#39;re ready for testing it.&amp;nbsp; Hop over to Youtube and fish up useful movies on exactly what you want to know (good luck).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Inch forward, using the Agile test-as-you-go tiny increments approach (heavily ratcheted, for steep learning curves, even vertical climbs if need be, though I&#39;m not into melodrama necessarily).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Python we&#39;re lucky to inherit Java&#39;s JUnit framework, which goes really deep once you add in the mock objects.&amp;nbsp; At OST, we emphasized TDD as a methodology (write the tests first).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Talking up &quot;open source&quot; and really taking that culture seriously, including its internal conflicts and heritage, is something I do as a geek.&amp;nbsp; If you listen to me, you learn about this or that rift or conflict, but it&#39;s not like I&#39;m endlessly grinding a lot of axes.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve got it down to very few axes at this point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of those cutting edge blades of debate is:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2840336&quot;&gt;where do we include Unicode&lt;/a&gt; in K-12 in US public schools?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s up to me and if I were writing on this topic I&#39;d want to dig down in the curriculum first, not that there&#39;s only the one, do some homework.&amp;nbsp; The US is a diverse territory and there was never a consensus on what to say about Unicode or how long to spend on UTF-8.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not everyone reading my blogs cares if the US is stuck in the calculator era and not facing the future. Yes, I have a parochial outlook thanks to my geographic location and personal history.&amp;nbsp; Portland, Oregon was the city of my childhood, which I returned to after many exciting adventures overseas. I&#39;ve lived here since 1985 and put kids through the school system, volunteered in it, even had some paid work in it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you scan these blog posts, you may see some of the same discussions you&#39;ve been having, regarding &quot;i18n&quot; for example (&quot;internationalization&quot; as every geek knows).&amp;nbsp; However, a lot of what I talk about is pretty esoteric by today&#39;s standards, fair warning.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not saying that to be condescending as I&#39;m the first to admit to not being inner circle when it comes to certain parties.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m as clueless as they come regarding the secrets of many cults.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trimet has a great Trip Planner system, multi-modal, and with a public API.&amp;nbsp; If your city bus system has a public API, then join that inner circle.&amp;nbsp; Hey, even if you live far away, if what you need is simply practice getting back complicated XML about something so easy to reason about as getting from A to B by public transportation, I&#39;d recommend registering with Trimet and grabbing a developer token.&amp;nbsp; Get ideas for your own city, don&#39;t reinvent the wheel.&amp;nbsp; Or do.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d like to see a JSON output option, bet Metro would too.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Denizens of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/02/rabble-babble.html&quot;&gt;the USSA&lt;/a&gt; are the most spied upon in the world, thanks to their &quot;own&quot; devices, which phone home to inform all sorts of private interests about one&#39;s activities and location.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those wishing more privacy have an uphill battle out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One could argue that people are not entitled to complete privacy and/or invisibility assuming they share public resources.&amp;nbsp; If you&#39;re on the road, sharing it, we have the right to know your identity, no?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sense of paranoia that&#39;s been building is being deflected onto the Russians these days.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re the ones doing the spying, not the home team.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bannon served on the board of &lt;i&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/i&gt;, which boasts having data on every voter in the US, enough to compute an OCEAN profile and target ads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though this company openly takes credit for the Trump campaign&#39;s effectiveness, we learn it was &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/12/countermeasures.html&quot;&gt;Russians and Wikileaks&lt;/a&gt; that tipped the scales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How many mainstream media reports have directed attention to &quot;Russian hackers&quot; versus this psychometrics company based in the UK?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those media reports picking up on that story are mostly &lt;a href=&quot;http://littleatoms.com/news-science/donald-trump-didnt-win-election-through-facebook&quot;&gt;dismissive of this &quot;myth&quot;&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;i&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/i&gt; has working voodoo.&amp;nbsp; I agree with the &quot;myth&quot; part, but then so is the &quot;Russian hackers&quot; story about mythical powers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s myth versus myth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The effectiveness of targeted advertising based on profiling is hardly a &quot;myth&quot; to social media companies such as Facebook and Google.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s how they make their money.&amp;nbsp; The fact that political campaigns are likewise advertising campaigns is obvious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So how does playing down the role of psychometrics companies stack up against the reams of stories playing up their importance?&amp;nbsp; How hypocritical are these &quot;myth busters&quot; willing to be?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are psychometric computations what drive this narrative of &quot;Russia the evildoer&quot;?&amp;nbsp; That seems a truism in my lexicon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Politicians (social engineers) feel in their gut that oughta work (scaring people about the Russians).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Going with one&#39;s gut is what psychometrics is all about, especially minus the big data component, which might serve as an unwelcome reality check in some cases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
USers have been susceptible to Red Scares for a long time, so what does it matter if the Russians are no longer red?&amp;nbsp; Can&#39;t we scare the USers anyway, or at least make them angry?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s what organized crime wants to find out.&amp;nbsp; Experiments are underway.&amp;nbsp; The mainstream media is their tool of choice, what they&#39;ve learned how to use.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You know what I always say:&amp;nbsp; if you want to be a US president, you need to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(A) know how to lie persuasively and&lt;br /&gt;
(B) have close ties with organized crime (including the CIA).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, president Clinton well understood about the need to ship arms to the Contras in contravention of the Boland Amendment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CIA wouldn&#39;t enjoy the loyalty of its home team mercenaries if big money were not involved, meaning cocaine sales and money laundering, with lots of partying for friendly politicos.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clinton could not have become president had he not, as governor of Arkansas, helped with the CIA&#39;s program, a continuation from Vietnam War days, where drug trafficking was likewise a big part of Air America&#39;s business.&amp;nbsp; Not a secret.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
President Trump is still being tested by organized crime, as Putin has his own criminal networks and the idea of &quot;getting along with Putin&quot; is pitting mob against mob, at least in the lower ranks. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trump&#39;s base wants to find out if &quot;draining the swamp&quot; has anything to do with telling more of the truth about recent history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the mainstream media is purposely forgetful (&quot;United States of Amnesia&quot;) and has no means to connect the dots for people in any short evening news format, the social media habits of USAers have changed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They want the bigger picture.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re turning to Youtube.&amp;nbsp; Many of them are not big readers, thanks to TV, but then the Internet is turning out to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/urner-workshop.html&quot;&gt;a lot like TV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hollerith machines were all about keeping tabs on people and of course the Germans wanted them to implement Nazi programs.&amp;nbsp; IBM helped them out.&amp;nbsp; Lets figure out who all is Jewish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We forget how many in the US business community were tacitly rooting for Hitler.&amp;nbsp; Eugenics, as a &quot;science&quot; was co-developed on Long Island.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once the war was over, the losers did not necessarily agree it was over and the Cold War picked up right where WW2 left off, just as the war in Korea rolled right into the war in Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many Nazis ended up in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/02/study-circle.html&quot;&gt;the Middle East&lt;/a&gt;, working with the CIA to frustrate Arab nationalism.&amp;nbsp; German scientists pleaded innocence and flooded into the US rocketry program, resulting in ICBMs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Undermining governments, forcing regime change, has been the game for a long time.&amp;nbsp; The mob rules.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a tough lesson to teach in school though, so a lot of people end up confused.&amp;nbsp; They suppose ideals match the reality and criminality relates to &quot;a few bad apples&quot; and nothing systemic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one is asking if the Trump campaign was in close touch with UK intelligence operatives throughout the election season.&amp;nbsp; If we&#39;re as fast and loose with definitions as we are where Russians are concerned, then the answer is yes, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which nation did the US have a war with to win independence for itself, Russia or the UK?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ah, but with the latter we (the USers) have a &quot;special relationship&quot;.&amp;nbsp; British Aerospace and the Pentagon are joined at the hip.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/07/big-fix-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;BP oil&lt;/a&gt; powers the USSA&#39;s aircraft carriers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ve been taught that Russia is our enemy.&amp;nbsp; Those reflexes still work, but maybe not as much as they used to?&amp;nbsp; Stay tuned.&amp;nbsp; Global literacy levels are still on the rise.&amp;nbsp; Telling people how they must think is getting more difficult.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Lots of truckers share advice and stories on Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That gives me an opportunity to ask directly, and respectfully, if they&#39;d have any interest in driving overseas, as a part of a truck driver focused student exchange service.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve already gotten a green light &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/02/trucking-again.html&quot;&gt;from academia&lt;/a&gt; to pursue such interests, but really I need truckers themselves, along with transportation engineers, to be more aware of their options.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Market research...&amp;nbsp; Focus groups... Does Google maps have the overlays we need?&amp;nbsp; What other map services will we need, to keep out Kabul-to-Istanbul lanes flowing smoothly?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trucking as currently designed allows &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/y4V0aJudHhw&quot;&gt;precious little time&lt;/a&gt; for tourism.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s dock-to-dock, through the dirty side of most cities.&amp;nbsp; Many people treat truck drivers rather poorly.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s where the academics come in:&amp;nbsp; drivers get a full-blown work-study program.&amp;nbsp; Our curriculum is about more than moving freight.&amp;nbsp; Lets think about families.&lt;br /&gt;

In addition to working with world game planners on Global U ideas &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/02/trucking-again.html&quot;&gt;around trucking&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;m studying a &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; article, &lt;i&gt;Dymaxion Man&lt;/i&gt;, about Fuller, published in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sure, that&#39;s one way to compute the account, tell the story.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; features a lot of intelligent writing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No mention of the Cornwall Eden Project, nor of the Epcot Buckyball (&quot;Spaceship Earth&quot;). How does Synergetics relate to the CCP?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No mention of Dr. Arthur Loeb, nor A &amp;amp; B modules, T &amp;amp; E modules (3D printable!).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ll have exhibits in our World Game Museum, of what the textbooks were ignoring (a basis for ignorance). Lets see how the narrative accounts compute then, shall we?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is West Point teaching the Bucky stuff at least, sharing our American heritage with high ranking officers?&amp;nbsp; Scandalous if not. We&#39;re investigating. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;The
 main literary trope I find regarding Bucky is that he was a failure and
 his inventions didn&#39;t fly. Put his awards and degrees, number of works 
published, historical role as &quot;engineer saint&quot;, in a pile, and put that 
pile next to any detractor&#39;s and compare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;True, he didn&#39;t win a Nobel 
Prize. Is eleven honorary PhDs enough (given for free remember, to help a
 school uphold its own brand)? Elliot Norton chair of poetry at Harvard?
 Patents not just on the dome, but the IVM itself (like if Descartes had
 patented XYZ).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;This guy appears to be a huge success, by objective 
criteria. One of the most successful who ever lived. I think the &quot;he was
 a failure&quot; trope is a projection. People think &quot;the world is still a 
ghetto ergo Bucky did not succeed.&quot; Specious. Completely void of real 
thought.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-ft=&quot;{&amp;quot;tn&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;K&amp;quot;}&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;UFICommentBody&quot;&gt;Or was it 47 PhDs? That&#39;s what &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/biography&quot;&gt;BFI claims&lt;/a&gt;. Depends what &quot;doctorate&quot; means maybe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

 being spurned early in his career by the architecture and construction 
establishments, Fuller was later recognized with many major 
architectural, scientific, industrial, and design awards, both in the 
United States and abroad, and he received 47 honorary doctorate degrees.
 In 1983, shortly before his death, he received the Presidential Medal 
of Freedom, the nation&#39;s highest civilian honor, with a citation

Your math teacher may use the Jitterbug Transformation to help explain how the cuboctahedron and icosahedron layers might morph into one another without gaining or losing constituent balls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1, 12, 42, 92, 162... is the sequence we&#39;re talking about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Geometrical concepts may be imparted via a number of these moving sculptures, or dynamic devices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another such device is the triangular book with one triangular page, its tip traveling in a 180 degree arc and defining two complementary tetrahedrons (same volume as each other) all along the way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the page is straight up, and the edges are all 2, we call that unit volume in the XYZ coordinate system, made from cubes of edges 1.&amp;nbsp; These two sculptures have the same volume. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Quadray coordinate system apparatus gives us yet another conversation piece with which to leverage greater understanding of the target namespace.&amp;nbsp; Again, the canonical edges (not base vectors) are of edges 2.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our World Game Museum will feature a lot of textbooks that saw fit to not include any of this information, nor the related whole number volumes schema.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Probing questions will be posed, and documentary postmortems invited.&amp;nbsp; People will come up with varying theories to explain the censoring habits of minions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I have one baseball and want to completely surround it with others.
One way: put six around the center one on a table, then three on
top, three on the bottom. With real baseballs, this would be difficult.&lt;br /&gt;

:: &lt;i&gt;stand-up philosophy by Wes Cecil&lt;/i&gt; ::&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I wrote on Facebook: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Really enjoyed this, because he&#39;s doing philosophy and standup comedy at
 the same time. Gets my attention. Yay, my discipline gets into the 
nightclub scene (reminds me of Tom Lehrer).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
... and in a follow-up comment:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The End of Racism&lt;/i&gt; by Dinesh D&#39;Souza is pretty on target in arguing many anti-racists miss a golden opportunity in buying into &quot;race&quot; as a tenant of their own belief systems, such a foggy and ill-designed concept as Wes Cecil takes up in his mocking philosophy talk. However, given how deeply engrained is the thought pattern, I have to accept that most Americans (at least) are terminally racist (will take belief in races to their grave) and it will be up to future generations to look back and dissect these beliefs in a more clinical postmortem manner.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But then as some of my friends point out, Dinesh has gotten in trouble with the law, and was a big Trump supporter, anti-Hillary. So does that mean races are real?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Thanks for the update about D&#39;Souza, got me checking his website too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
I do believe in ethnicity as meaningful. I notice racists have a hard time naming the races. The idea of races pre-dates genetic science, which has only further undermined the idea. Certainly &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot; is not a race. Or maybe some think it is, as there&#39;s really not much agreement on what the races are in the first place, assuming they exist for the sake of argument.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/synergetics/terms.html#race&quot;&gt;Quoting&lt;/a&gt; from my &lt;i&gt;Synergetics on the Web&lt;/i&gt; (1990s): &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Western science originally portrayed race and class as characteristics 
of a person&#39;s blood which, as such, could be subdivided in proportion to
 a person&#39;s ancestry, &quot;blood&quot; being treated as a mathematical quantity, 
contributed in equal proportions by one&#39;s parents. Hence such terms as 
&quot;octamaroon&quot; (one eighth black). Whereas &quot;class&quot; is no longer regarded 
as a genetic entity, &quot;race&quot; has remained a popular concept for grouping 
genetic characteristics, even if the link to blood is no longer made. 
Like anthropologist Ashley Montague, Fuller felt the concept of &quot;race&quot; 
had outlived its usefulness, that the cross-breeding of the world&#39;s 
people, especially evident in North America, was exposing the old racial
 categories as mere snap-shots of genetic traits thrown together by the 
exigencies of time, but available in any number of permutations from 
that vast grab bag of traits known as the human gene pool. In the Fuller
 lexicon, a racist is perhaps most straightfowardly defined as &lt;i&gt;someone who believes in races&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
