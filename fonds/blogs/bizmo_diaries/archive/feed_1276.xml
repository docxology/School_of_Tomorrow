Don&#39;t Scratch and Squeak have that demographic covered?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Monty Python&lt;/span&gt; isn&#39;t &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Teletubbies&lt;/span&gt;.  Guido isn&#39;t &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mr. Rogers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-quaker-animism.html&quot;&gt;or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Captain Kangaroo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m concerned that our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/pythonic-math.html&quot;&gt;product placement campaigns&lt;/a&gt; might be most effective at TV-14 and above, more like Jay Leno (i.e. late night TV).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;ve been batting around the airport concourse idea, as a place for &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/brought-to-you-by.html&quot;&gt;the logo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of Jay Leno, I caught Katie&#39;s appearance as his guest last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, I agree the brave troops have an impossible job getting between the opium crop and fundamentalism, even while promising schools, jobs and health care, winning hearts and minds all around (Operation Valhalla).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This level of security is hard to accomplish, even in the homeland (we&#39;re not there yet), let alone as some stranger in a strange land with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/03/pycon-2005.html&quot;&gt;minimal relevant language skills&lt;/a&gt;.  I was just writing about that yesterday (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like mission impossible on steroids, makes you wonder what else those so-called policy gurus have &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/bait-and-switch.html&quot;&gt;up their sleeves&lt;/a&gt; in DC.  They think soldiers are superheros don&#39;t they?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/11/yakking-about-tv.html&quot;&gt;Too much TV&lt;/a&gt; growing up?  Too many &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/06/iron-man-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Marvel&lt;/span&gt; comics&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The merciful thing would be to discover a civilian political process that incorporates religious fanaticism somehow, Israel a good model (ultra-orthodox have a role).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t balance your books on the backs of your military, if you know what&#39;s good for ya (I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/barak-obama-power-of-change-movie.html&quot;&gt;the First Lady&lt;/a&gt; would agree).  Use TV effectively, to foster national debate -- let people see for themselves who the players are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m sure the Pakistanis have some thoughts on these matters.  In a recent interview I saw by Lara Logan (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/10/good-night-and-good-luck-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;also CBS&lt;/a&gt;) of Pakistan&#39;s president Asif Ali Zardari, there was some thought the out-of-towners &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/13/eveningnews/main4601463.shtml&quot;&gt;should have visas&lt;/a&gt;, including if appearing in some combat capacity (not recommended).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Non-visa bearing troops seem a tad like an invading and/or occupying army, which builds sympathy for the locals (we saw this in Iraq as well), including for its more radical elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smart commanders know better than to lose the battle for hearts and minds so easily, so I&#39;m guessing the visa situation is being addressed -- not my area of expertise, but there&#39;s probably something in the papers about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/cinco-de-mayo.html&quot;&gt;ISEPP list&lt;/a&gt;, we&#39;ve been chatting about some Endogenous Economics out of California.  Terry thinks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2007/08/romer_on_growth.html&quot;&gt;this guy Romer&lt;/a&gt; makes a lot of sense, and he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I feel somewhat superior towards Californians (am a typical Oregonian in that way), I could nevertheless see applications of EE to the brand of Home Economics we&#39;ve been cooking up for Portland Public Schools (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/pps-has-friends-in-silicon-forest.html&quot;&gt;PPS&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our stuff may be &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/looking-forward.html&quot;&gt;more futuristic&lt;/a&gt; than some people are used to, but we could still have some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/08/14/national/main4349728.shtml&quot;&gt;Julia Child videos&lt;/a&gt;, Martha Stewart too why not?  Maybe also &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/day-after.html&quot;&gt;Roz Savage&lt;/a&gt;?  We focus on joules and/or calories a lot, so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1933378&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;Supermarket Math&lt;/a&gt;.

We read the same tea leaves you do, steal ideas from &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/epcot-makeover.html&quot;&gt;the same theme parks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bizmo is like an RV.  Some say it has military origins in dark budget projects, which adds to their mystery (the black ones with no license plates compete with the black helicopters for attention on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Coast to Coast&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be that as it may, they&#39;re oft decorated with comforting decals, from companies we know and love.  You&#39;ll see these things on the road &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/03/on-road.html&quot;&gt;even today&lt;/a&gt;, just not in caravans maybe, unless military, in which case we&#39;re back to square one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In going into the schools, we&#39;re doing like an event, for assembly, but we&#39;re mainly there to empower &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/03/on-road.html&quot;&gt;peer teachers&lt;/a&gt;, in the sense of giving them more interesting stuff to work with down the road, starting then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our DVDs are exclusive firsts, or, if compilations off the Internet, lovingly edited by people who really know our business.  We have good games, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/mathematical-toyz.html&quot;&gt;cool toyz&lt;/a&gt;, work opportunities of clear benefit to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A curriculum isn&#39;t just a hodge podge.  We have high standards. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a lot &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/traveling-circus.html&quot;&gt;like a circus&lt;/a&gt; (like Monty Python&#39;s flying one) and yes, we might sometimes have helicopters, as disaster relief includes using those, as does simply getting from here to there sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;In &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Control Room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we&#39;re aware of control room lore (in science fiction movies especially), There, I focus more on providing bizmos with their various criss-crossing itineraries, a negotiation process.  In actual practice, many companies might be involved in this kind of scheduling (many control rooms), including some religious ones e.g. revivalists of some description might field their own mobile &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Church of Elvis&lt;/span&gt; or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2903298685/&quot; title=&quot;Honk If You Love Elvis by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/2903298685_8640104642_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Honk If You Love Elvis&quot; width=&quot;240&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/quakes.html&quot;&gt;Quaker subgenius type&lt;/a&gt; (not quite the genius I&#39;d like to be -- I cut myself slack), I count myself as one of these &quot;true believers&quot; and often think how Quakers used to own Cadbury&#39;s, Lloyds of London, maybe even Quaker Oats itself (we don&#39;t at the moment, though you might imagine how that might seem a holy grail of sorts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Grain of Sand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is of course a Blake allusion, and signifies &quot;one among many&quot;.  Like I&#39;m not wanting this lifestyle for &quot;just me&quot; and in a lot of ways copied it &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/more-about-bizmos.html&quot;&gt;from Charles Kuralt&lt;/a&gt;, which CBS is well aware of my doing (no lawsuit threatened, just saying &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/our-columbia-river.html&quot;&gt;they know&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m a big believer in &quot;institutional wealth&quot; like airports, like libraries, and yes, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/12/some-youtube-r.html&quot;&gt;like aircraft carriers&lt;/a&gt;.  If you own your own personal submarine, then you&#39;re like Dr. Evil in the those &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/casino-royale-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Bond movies&lt;/a&gt;, or at best like Paul Allen or one of those.  You can&#39;t just be another dweeb &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/back-on-beat.html&quot;&gt;on the beat&lt;/a&gt;, not that I&#39;d cop to being a dweeb in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;every&lt;/span&gt; dimension but you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not hoping to own the only bizmo in town (or even own one at all really -- I&#39;ll check it out from the fleet), nor even the most wowy one, with pipes sticking out.  This isn&#39;t about me being one of the super rich, in other words.  I&#39;m pretty studiously middle class, only eat caviar once in a blue moon, when I&#39;m invited to a party maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the darth vader undertones, the circus bus fleets don&#39;t leave the garage much these days because Gnu Math sounds too hippie.  The generals think once my fleet is on the road, it&#39;ll just be freaks chasing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/islamic-art.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Grateful Dead&lt;/span&gt; concert&lt;/a&gt; all over again, and we know how that goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, lots of stupid projections are keeping our lifestyle in check, while they go over our curriculum with a fine tooth comb, looking for things to nitpick about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, USAers wallow in intellectual squalor, not learning Gnu Math or understanding much about World Game in general (they still think it&#39;s about aping Rome or living out some other antiquarian fantasy, something about &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;24 Hours&lt;/span&gt;, which I rarely look at -- but has a control room I notice -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/team-america-world-police-movie-review_04.html&quot;&gt;go &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Team America, World Police&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So should we do this in Russia?  That&#39;d be fine except I don&#39;t speak Russian or any of those, so would be like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Family Guy&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2m45w2VDuM&amp;amp;feature=related&quot;&gt;that episode&lt;/a&gt; where he applies for a Macarthur grant (for geniuses) but ends up two standard deviations on the other side of it (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KG-fttUB6uw&quot;&gt;he makes the most of it&lt;/a&gt;).  Plus I &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;am&lt;/span&gt; a family guy, don&#39;t really want to move to some Gulag just yet, like my base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m pretty sure the &quot;bizmo phenomenon&quot; will continue spreading, as we gear up around delivering better health care.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3576959706/&quot;&gt;The clinics will have them&lt;/a&gt;, some dentists already do.  Whether we call &#39;em &quot;bizmos&quot; (business mobiles) or not is not really up to me, and I&#39;m fine with &quot;RVs on steroids&quot; or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/daves-bizmo.html&quot;&gt;whatever Dave Ulmer has&lt;/a&gt;, except maybe smaller&quot;, whatever descriptoids.  How about a &quot;geek bus&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Control Room&lt;/span&gt; krew has to be pretty smart though, lots of GIS (i.e. global data).  You don&#39;t want to promise all this Internet connectivity, get a school all galvanized, and then discover there&#39;s no affordable way to supply even minimal DSL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes a robust intranet is all they need, if extremely remote, with fat pipes for downloading, only relatively thin ones for uploading.  Some planning needs to happen, before the roadshow comes in.  A lot of what happens is more behind the scenes, of necessity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not saying it has to look just like mission control in Houston, but given all the video feed coming in from the field, it&#39;s likely to resemble something rather familiar to the television industry, the industry most likely to produce these shows anyway, given those stables of celebs already rarein&#39; to go (though in need of training a lot of &#39;em, some kind of geek boot camp?).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1819182840580595625'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1819182840580595625'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/recap.html' title='Recap'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3293/2903298685_8640104642_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1183061360999067680</id><published>2009-05-08T18:34:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-06-04T14:41:47.772-07:00</updated><title type='text'>New BFI PR</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/v7OBTiyMoSE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/v7OBTiyMoSE&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;344&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: we&#39;re liking this, looking forward to more... ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not that new actually.

A lot of people had made the connection to Cinco de Mayo, so we had plenty of burritos, enchiladas, margaritas.  I brought Mexican beer with some limes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an upscale Beaverton crowd, very West Hills, very Intel (i.e. cosmopolitan, multi-lingual) if I may be permitted to stereotype (talking &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/08/block-party.html&quot;&gt;zip code demographics&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were middle aged successful professionals, often with children (Tara had another engagement, but maybe she could come some other time -- lots of kids her age, with their own space).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I found interesting about the chatter:  seems like every guy my age is developing an application for the iPhone; we&#39;re really interested in energy, yak about the grid as if it were our shared backyard (which it is, sorta).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard very little about politics, either local or global (not that energy is apolitical, except it is, sorta).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3508081364/&quot;&gt;Terry&lt;/a&gt; wants me to join the ISEPP board, given he&#39;s trying to promote his ISEPP salons, has lost &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/09/wanderers-200892.html&quot;&gt;Doug Strain&lt;/a&gt; among others.  I&#39;m to send him &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/users/70&quot;&gt;a short bio&lt;/a&gt;.  The salons (per Nirel&#39;s nomenclature) will be themed and involve wiki-backed reading programs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The salons are a way to disseminate multi-disciplinary information through both presentations and schmoozing, Q&amp;amp;A with the invited experts (architects, policy analysts... GIS professionals), something universities aren&#39;t so good at (inter-departmental cross-talk is a rarity).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per our Wanderers marketing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&quot;Science would be ruined if it were to withdraw entirely into narrowly defined specialties. The rare scholars who are wanderers-by-choice are essential to the intellectual welfare of the settled disciplines.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Benoit Mandelbrot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Given our overlapping interest in &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;coffee shop subcultures&lt;/a&gt;, I see this as consistent enough with my heart&#39;s desires to be worth pursuing.

But then I&#39;m not all that impressed by the metric system for everything geographic, either, so call me a dinosaur, a living fossil or whatever (I&#39;m thick enough skinned).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, I bent a spoon yesterday, first time in awhile.  Lost control of it when trying to stir up a vortex, hit the blade in the blender, berry blend everywhere, and glass.  Shades of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/science-project.html&quot;&gt;our science experiment&lt;/a&gt;.  Dr. Nick entered the scene, took a few seconds to process this wasn&#39;t blood.  Tara also an observer of my &quot;junior moment&quot; (or &quot;senior moment&quot; depending on biases).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we had family over, plus I got that date with Larry finally, over Thai food again, comparing notes about Kennedy Space Center, near where Dawn went to high school (Satellite Beach).  Then he showed me the two opening episodes of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mad Men&lt;/span&gt; (on loan &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/more-networking.html&quot;&gt;from Gayle&lt;/a&gt;) which I&#39;d long been curious about, his dad having been one (on Madison Avenue and everything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry is one of the smartest managers in Lower48 and then some they tell me, though I know him mostly &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/06/pioneer-century.html&quot;&gt;through Quakers&lt;/a&gt;.  He used to work on McGovern&#39;s campaign, has a prospering business, really cool kids.  His wife Chris was Tara&#39;s Montessori teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously I used the opportunity with a pro to rush through my &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/bridge-pedal-in-rear-view-mirror.html&quot;&gt;Providence story&lt;/a&gt; then flipped to &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Coffee Shops Network&lt;/a&gt; on Jackalope, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3325262372/sizes/l/&quot;&gt;popping open the hood&lt;/a&gt;.

Follow-up:  ate &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/lunch-on-hawthorne.html&quot;&gt;at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Than Thao&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, enjoyed a bloody mary, Glenn joined us, having shown off his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3498742180/&quot;&gt;new collage&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
Tara&#39;s home with a food reaction, devouring &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;House M.D.&lt;/span&gt;, me jacked in through Jackalope, dominating the world (geek job description).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of which, they &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/24/politics/main4686029.shtml&quot;&gt;had a geek&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CBS Early Show&lt;/span&gt; this morning, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/30/earlyshow/main4980238.shtml&quot;&gt;one Garth Sundem&lt;/a&gt;, hadn&#39;t met him before, might not be a Python guy or whatever, but he knew who Linus Torvalds was, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All guys apparently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then he expounded on the meaning of &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/06/nightmare-alley-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;geek&lt;/a&gt;&quot;: it means &quot;passionate about something&quot; with &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780307450340&amp;amp;view=excerpt&quot;&gt;world domination&lt;/a&gt;&quot; being sort of video game shorthand for &quot;mastery&quot; or &quot;fanatical dedication to an activity&quot; or &quot;at the top of one&#39;s game&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So then like &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/11/peer-group-networking.html&quot;&gt;Lara Logan&lt;/a&gt; might be a &quot;news geek&quot;, Lance Armstrong a &quot;bicycle geek&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/day-after.html&quot;&gt;Roz Savage&lt;/a&gt; a &quot;rowing geek&quot; and so on.  Hey, I like it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;House&lt;/span&gt; character bugs me quite a bit.  I routinely attack him, though today I&#39;m being quiet and letting Tara enjoy her heroes (it&#39;s the whole crew that makes it fun, I get it).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#39;s me fulminating in an earlier email (link added):&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-April/009335.html&quot;&gt;Bringing more FOSS into classrooms&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of teaching basic numeracy is overdue, not feeling like a supplicant really, more like a guy who pays into the system, have democratic rights, and yet my entire subculture is shoved to the side, like gypsies, and yet engineers are expected to keep the infrastructure going, and yet we&#39;re denied our supply of potential recruits, in part by &quot;math teachers&quot; with no worthy skills who sidetrack the little darlings into meaningless years wasted slaving at desks to no good outcome.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Sounds like some guy &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/mapping-gnu-math.html&quot;&gt;on the war path&lt;/a&gt;.

Fred Books says that writing software is like farming, hunting werewolves, or drowning with dinosaurs in a tar pit.  Paul Heckel says it&#39;s like filming &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&lt;/span&gt;.  David Gries says it&#39;s a science.  Donald Knuth says it&#39;s an art.  Watts Humphrey says it&#39;s a process.  Peter Freeman says it&#39;s a system.  Harlan Mills says it&#39;s like solving mathematical problems, performing surgery, or butchering hogs.  Mark Spinard and Curt Abraham say it&#39;s like exploring the Wild West, bathing in cold streams, and eating beans around a campfire.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I&#39;m probably more in that &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/fixing-g.html&quot;&gt;Wild West school&lt;/a&gt;, but I&#39;d think you&#39;d want to use metaphors friendly to your subculture / ethnicity.  There&#39;s no need to narrow it to one namespace surely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, one of our upcoming &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;OS Bridge&lt;/span&gt; talks &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/240&quot;&gt;looks at farming&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&#39;t know much about farming, but was thinking of this proposal when I did my imitation of David Beazley&#39;s more professional &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-April/009325.html&quot;&gt;introduction to coroutines&lt;/a&gt; in Python.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6910611279649933236'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6910611279649933236'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/metaphors-matter.html' title='Metaphors Matter'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-745488911183751216</id><published>2009-04-26T10:16:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-04-26T12:31:48.164-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Testing Jackalope</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhEpvIA2zEpU_OSdksnsa9Ve9oolXD2LoJqzqUz0h7XKJwOTkpPGO2JWaMwI2vy49j4Q_OkMgiLbaIAMtm7hsEnWZPu86j2H7DUd59YCMO9BlGNi0KHNIlQISvxZlzSExhpOmm/s1600-h/gscupt2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 200px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhhEpvIA2zEpU_OSdksnsa9Ve9oolXD2LoJqzqUz0h7XKJwOTkpPGO2JWaMwI2vy49j4Q_OkMgiLbaIAMtm7hsEnWZPu86j2H7DUd59YCMO9BlGNi0KHNIlQISvxZlzSExhpOmm/s320/gscupt2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5329060274042543842&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;font-size:85%;&quot; &gt;tutorial on &lt;a href=&quot;http://gsculpt.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;gSculpt&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/concluding-europython.html&quot;&gt;Geoffrey French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;running on mplayer in compiz cube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The screen flicker in my case maybe wasn&#39;t due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-kernel-common/+bug/164589&quot;&gt;wifi and AC power concerns &lt;/a&gt;in the nVidia driver, but a wrong setting in the X Server settings.  I&#39;m still looking into it.  At the moment, the problem seems resolved.

I figure my &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/users/70&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;OS Bridge&lt;/span&gt; presentation&lt;/a&gt; should be state of the art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The media has needed to see more dots connected to be able to omni- triangulate the story more clearly. Who has been resisting the design science revolution and why? Translating to FOSS terms, GNU/Linux has come out on top, but still needs to propagate. There&#39;s a lot of romance in the lore, epic sagas, that we need to keep telling (and we do). The &quot;Bucky file&quot; (B-File, like an X-File) adds a tremendous number of puzzle pieces, to where our geek culture is now &quot;ready to roll&quot;. I don&#39;t think as many journalists will get side-tracked into the &quot;Bucky as Britney&quot; genre this time, i.e. all that &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/poor-slob-bucky-psb.html&quot;&gt;poor slob Bucky&lt;/a&gt;&quot; talk is too squaresville, to qyoobist, for many readers to care anymore.

My walks to and from the Hyatt in Chicago involved traversing shovel ready dirt sidewalks turning to muck in the snow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The woman with the suitcase had an even harder time, had to pull it in the street.  I&#39;d have offered but she was clearly in self reliant mode so we just chatted instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another time, after dark, me trudging from the Blue Line station, a black SUV pulled alongside and suggested I hop in, which I did, given I knew the people.  Not having real sidewalks leads North Americans to waste gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dotting the landscape with company towns built to a human scale, self sufficient enough to forgo the &quot;bedroom community&quot; fate, would be another way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So-called retirement communities would do well to keep some business channels open, as some oldsters have sysadmin skills, want an intranet to keep playing with.  Retiring boomers want access to GNU/Linux, not shuffleboard so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People learn to live this way (in walkable, golf cartable communities) on small campuses especially, but also in religious establishments set aside for scholarship and contemplative living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latter often specialize in wine, cheese, chocolate, beer or other agricultural product for barter and/or ecommerce shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, a given XRL might offer web services, advertising, technical writing, even television production.  Some serve &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/groundbreaking-solutions.html&quot;&gt;as call centers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By hearsay, I know of one such remote community that specializes in state liquor laws, getting establishments licensed in whatever county.  They fly around a lot, but have this base to came home to.  That shifts the fuel mix, as cars and jets take from different tanks in the refinery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some cars and trucks also &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/annex.html#energy&quot;&gt;run on agricultural products&lt;/a&gt;, making them more competitive with bovines in some cases, in terms of driving up the price of grain.  However, not every source of biodiesel is as attractive to farm animals.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6647690810830980087'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6647690810830980087'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/earth-day-2009.html' title='Earth Day 2009'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-4116457180811973211</id><published>2009-04-20T13:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-12T09:04:10.519-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Waning Moon</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;i&gt;:: moon kitty with sarah angel ::&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
April 18:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3032664262/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;Moon Kitty&lt;/a&gt; may have suffered a spinal embolism, paralyzing her rear legs.  I quit the scene, Matt&#39;s 51st birthday celebration, to return to a tearful Tara.  She&#39;s a pretty old cat, but of course you don&#39;t see it coming, it least not in our case (sometimes there&#39;s a history of heart disease).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We did have a good time celebrating Matt&#39;s coming of age (51), with young high schoolers &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3455139065/&quot;&gt;in prom clothes&lt;/a&gt; all about, as it&#39;s that time of year.  Looking at all the stretch limos, I came up with the &quot;stretch Smart Car&quot; as a humorous oxymoron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We could rush Moon to a 24/7 pet hospital and pay for some MRIs.  She&#39;s not yowling in pain much, is mostly not too distressed, more just frustrated when she tries to move her back legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will we postpone the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/frustrated-with-red-cross.html&quot;&gt;Red Cross training&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow, already once rescheduled?  I&#39;m having trouble switching gears.  I&#39;m on tap for a memorial service, serving as greeter.  Tara&#39;s supposed to take the bus.  But what about Moon?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do we have a budget for expensive pet care, or pet insurance?  Maybe I&#39;ll make some calls.  I&#39;m owed, but everybody has those stories.  The prognosis looks grim, so why disturb a peaceful kitty with a lot of bright lights and melodrama?  A car trip in the middle of the night?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of melodrama, I continued &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6680284&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;poking at NCTM&lt;/a&gt; on Math Forum today.  I&#39;ve been wrestling with that organization since the 1990s, when I tried to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/education-reform.html&quot;&gt;bring up the Bucky stuff&lt;/a&gt; with them.  I don&#39;t think I made many friends in so doing.  Math teachers are quite defensive about what they&#39;re not teaching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rose and Tara watched &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Slumdog Millionaire&lt;/span&gt; again, without the glitches.  I need to settle with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hollywood Video&lt;/span&gt;, am also still missing a library book (about Pascal&#39;s Triangle).  My inbox is far from empty these days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These concerns seem petty I realize.  Should I write about &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/avp-again.html&quot;&gt;deeper problems&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Solving refugee problems would be a good place to start with the college credit courses.  You&#39;ll get experiences you can&#39;t get just staring at a screen, although screen time is part of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;ll also need physical coordination, management skills, training with equipment, many kinds of practice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Civilian service is no less a challenge than military.  A lot of the same skills carry over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today I joined a Friendly Care team spearheaded by Leslie Hickcox way out on 151st street.  I ended up behind a van saying WAR 151 on the license plate and imagined being one of those people who gets in a tizzy about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3455959500/&quot;&gt;coincidental events&lt;/a&gt;.  I went so far as to take &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3455951252/&quot;&gt;a picture&lt;/a&gt; anyway.  We were there to assist in a moving project.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later I went &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3455136559/&quot;&gt;to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Home Depot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and got a blind replaced, the one that broke while I was away in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tara wants to skip the babysitting training tomorrow and maybe have a last day with Moon Kitty.  We think Red Cross will be understanding and let her postpone, after we missed &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/frustrated-with-red-cross.html&quot;&gt;the April 11 training&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Followups:  Tara got her Red Cross babysitting certification, no rush on the Moon scenario, we&#39;ve agreed to consult with a professional pronto.  Great meeting some of you at Ray&#39;s memorial service.  April 20: vet confirms diagnosis and prognosis (no blood pressure at all in the lower frame), recommends a swift course, which we choose. We&#39;ll be getting an urn.  Ray loved animals, another part of the sharing.  We honor them and miss them when they leave us.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/4116457180811973211'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/4116457180811973211'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/waning-moon.html' title='Waning Moon'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5980040421130537007</id><published>2009-04-16T16:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-05-20T13:54:10.555-07:00</updated><title type='text'>SAO Meeting</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/pin-ball-in-pdx.html&quot;&gt;the ping ball thing&lt;/a&gt; again, getting to lots of meetings.  This one with Chris was excellent, helped me connect dots with Saturday Academy, think in some new tracks about how we&#39;re doing it in Oregon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talked Ubuntu quite a bit, also the gender imbalance, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sao.org/&quot;&gt;SAO&lt;/a&gt; has funded some studies regarding.  I mentioned this being &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/women-and-foss.html&quot;&gt;a focus at OSCON&lt;/a&gt; as well, plus the fact that the female FOSS bosses we &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; tend to have goddess status right out of the gate i.e. it&#39;s not a matter of smashing a glass ceiling, unless you&#39;re 2nd tier, in which case you&#39;re more likely a guy (because of the ratios involved, like 9:1::XY:XX in many venues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had lunch outdoors on Hawthorne, enjoying a modest spring (sunny, but not blindingly).  I had coffee and a spinach salad, brought along some show and tell items, including &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;StrangeAttractors&lt;/span&gt; (Design Science Toys), &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CubeIT!&lt;/span&gt; (Huntar), &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ball of Whacks&lt;/span&gt; (Roger von Oech&#39;s, comes with seminars!), a Sam Lanahan &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flextegrity.com/&quot;&gt;flextegrity&lt;/a&gt;, an XO, some GIS literature, and a small Bucky book from the art museum, still shrink wrapped.  All this fit &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/saving-children.html&quot;&gt;my OSCON bag&lt;/a&gt;, believe it or not.  We had fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Oregonians are moving quickly on these issues, not just me, which is gratifying to learn.  Given I&#39;m such an old guy, I was able to talk about Visual FoxPro and dBase as if these were just yesterday&#39;s tools, whereas they&#39;re actually the day &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;before&lt;/span&gt; yesterday&#39;s (smile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-April/009291.html&quot;&gt;got me reminiscing though&lt;/a&gt;, had to agree with Patrick O&#39;Brien: Python has a lot to recommend it over xBase.  Still, our &quot;dot prompt&quot; culture isn&#39;t so different, in terms of our expecting a shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/03/pycon-2005.html&quot;&gt;The FoxPro development environment&lt;/a&gt; by the VFP Microsoft team had a to-die-for GUI design environment for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3210762990/&quot;&gt;a thick client&lt;/a&gt; (ala wxPython), i.e. a great way to go if you&#39;re not taking the thin client browser based route (see Ellen Ullman&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Close to the Metal&lt;/span&gt; for more on the evolution of database technology and what it was like in those days).  VFP&#39;s development environment was even better than Visual Studio&#39;s in some ways, pioneering Intellisense (which I&#39;d tend to turn off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it sounds funny to call today&#39;s web browsers &quot;thin&quot;, as if FoxPro runtime were any bigger in terms of sheer megabytes.  But the point is, the browser is an open standards well understood environment and almost everyone has one, meaning the actual application gets defined on the server, even if the downloaded Javascript ends up controlling the client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HttpResponse suitcases delivered over the wire unfold automatically &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-April/009283.html&quot;&gt;within your DOM&lt;/a&gt;, setting the stage for JQuery or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/02/democracy-engine.html&quot;&gt;GWT&lt;/a&gt; magic or whatever fun and games.  All this apparatus then disappears when you log out and drop the connection, whereas with FoxPro you have these multiple thick clients lying around in the form of exe and dll files, or should, unless you want a lot of unnecessary network congestion (like downloading a whole browser every time you want to use one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/04/kitchen-tableau.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ian and I&lt;/a&gt; talked by cell for a long time this afternoon with several interruptions.

Then Jeffry &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/sustainability-guy.html&quot;&gt;gave it a spin&lt;/a&gt;, ended up branching off in a new direction.  Helen added a framework, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/02/wanderers-2009211.html&quot;&gt;Appreciative Inquiry&lt;/a&gt;, so now even more of us are doing it, as we see the potential benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my case, it&#39;s about insinuating into that gap between public and private sectors, by which I don&#39;t mean tax-funded school vouchers (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/voucherology.html&quot;&gt;I&#39;m against those&lt;/a&gt;, if used to bolster competing systems, many with no use &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/sparking-investments.html&quot;&gt;for Uncle Sam&lt;/a&gt;).  As someone who cut a lot of teeth in the private sector, I feel uniquely qualified to come forward as a trainer of public school teachers, hoping to add to their arsenal of relevant skills and tools, perhaps in exchange for &lt;a href=&quot;http://nctmconference.blogspot.com/2009/04/closing-session-arne-duncan.html&quot;&gt;more merit pay&lt;/a&gt; and bragging rights as to their &quot;pilot project&quot; exclusiveness, if selected for &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/coyote-academy.html&quot;&gt;the program&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;m half teacher, half recruiter, half &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/location-scouting.html&quot;&gt;location scout&lt;/a&gt; (math joke about 3/2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do I retain PPS as a client.  &quot;Go for the ESDs, Luke&quot; said one advisor, &quot;and use da force&quot; (Pinoy accent).  &quot;Yes Yoda&quot; I said, &quot;but many of them hate me, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/pps-to-kill-lep-high.html&quot;&gt;because I support LEP High&lt;/a&gt;, charter schools as public schools, merit pay, all that Obama stuff the Democrats want to bury.  Means I&#39;m persona non grata in some circles&quot;.  &quot;Present to NCTM&quot; was my other advice, but now I&#39;m thinking &quot;ATM&quot; would be nicer (more congenial), given the Caleb Gattegno connection and &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/about-constructivism.html&quot;&gt;a stronger constructivism&lt;/a&gt;.  Lots of this Lower 48 stuff is merely &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;marketed&lt;/span&gt; as constructivism, but then they hold back &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/mathematical-toyz.html&quot;&gt;the real toyz&lt;/a&gt; (no computer programming for you young lady, that&#39;s just for the Phillips Exeter kids (lucky devils, learning Python at a tender age...)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not wanting to let go of hospital work either, which is why I keep thinking &quot;clients&quot; (in the plural).  I&#39;ve always had multiple clients and find that keeps me more open minded.  Besides, I&#39;d lose my private sector street cred if I became a full time classroom teacher.  The whole point of &quot;mining the gap&quot; is to keep a foot in both worlds -- if that makes any sense.  Out here in the Silicon Forest, we use Python as an industrial standard, to test Intel chips, to write eCommerce sites.  In there, in the math classroom, you could be getting more of our Supermarket Math then, not because you&#39;ll all become green grocers (though some of you will, and that&#39;s a high tech area what with RFID (maybe just let &#39;em push the cart through that door, no checkout lanes, sucks the Visa without anyone even opening a wallet (try in a PX first, for cigs and beer only?))).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mentioned to Tara about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/ecovillage-update-synergeo-33452.html&quot;&gt;Project Earthala again&lt;/a&gt; (we already have our first Queen), a little microvillage in the boonies, lots of Quaker aesthetics, but accessible to television, better than phony HBO stuff (love HBO, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Extras &lt;/span&gt;especially, though that&#39;s BBC &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;through&lt;/span&gt; HBO in some ways).  Dot these around, among other religious, get the eCommerce going (Catholic brandy, Jewish vodka...), and voila, a market for tiny commuter jets, from the same people that make your dwelling machines (economies of scale there).  I could do some teaching, even hospital work, from these high bandwidth XRL sites, doubling as computer camps when the schools aren&#39;t in session (or even when they are, in parallel).  The drawings are here in the blogs, just waiting for Lockheed-Martin to get back to me (defense puts me on hold a lot, thinks I&#39;m too tiny a customer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m also a movie and &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/service-calls.html&quot;&gt;TV critic&lt;/a&gt;, blogger extraordinaire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let&#39;s see what happens next.  The big question, on everybody&#39;s mind, is whether we&#39;ll be seeing more Mites, Sytes and Kites on public television.  I&#39;ll have to say something to OPB next time I get a chance (&quot;Hey OPB, come visit our Coffee Shops Network sometime, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/esozone-shoptalk.html&quot;&gt;get some free samples&lt;/a&gt;&quot;).  I also need to get to work on the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/span&gt; article for Wikipedia.  I&#39;ll switch to doing that now, need to add some pointers.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6507793572202454869'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6507793572202454869'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/what-shall-i-do.html' title='What Shall I Do?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-6798793546137710244</id><published>2009-04-07T19:03:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-04-07T19:03:33.652-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Grip Slip</title><content type='html'>I messed up doing my job as volunteer escort today, forgetting a regular gig.

I got to sit across from Scott Gray of the O&#39;Reilly School of Technology, over excellent food, cabernet from his county, talking &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/about-constructivism.html&quot;&gt;constructivism&lt;/a&gt; versus &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1914486&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;objectivism&lt;/a&gt;.  He expressed sincere admiration for Andre&#39;s Crunchy project &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-March/009187.html&quot;&gt;and talk&lt;/a&gt;.  As the six of us conversed, the hotel dimmed its lights to mark Earth Hour, a global event.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;Scott is in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cm.math.uiuc.edu/what&quot;&gt;Jerry Uhl lineage&lt;/a&gt; (Urbana-Champaign) and following a productive trajectory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My thanks to Steve, PSF chair, for making this introduction.  I also finally got to meet the elusive (to me)&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3397685205/&quot;&gt; Julie Steele of O&#39;Reilly&lt;/a&gt;.  We compared notes on Newark, NJ briefly (she likes it there).

To my right was &lt;a href=&quot;http://groovie.org/&quot;&gt;Ben Bangert&lt;/a&gt; inventor of hellanzb, a principal Pylons developer etc.  His take on the afternoon&#39;s ORM panel discussion was helpful to me.  I enjoy clear expressions of bias (e.g. from Leonard also).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Later, I was enabled to crash a party at a nearby hotel.

We&#39;re waiting for the signal from A/V (a Quakerly silience..., keys tapping). Jeff is our Dallas chief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namespaces are mappings, the foundation of Python:  globals, locals, (builtins).  Lexical context, dynamic context (Python uses lexical context for closeures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Name binding occurs during assignment, defs, imports, arg declaration, for statements, except clauses, as a result of closures.  Code objects + namespaces = coll stuff.  Steve makes this same distinction (&quot;object spaces&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#39;re not namespaces, run inside namespaces, are not function obejcts.  import, compile() exec, execfile etc., are code object creators (compilers we could say).  The &quot;assembly language&quot; of Python.  He&#39;s showing compiling on his slide.  from dis import dis.  co = compile(blah blah).  ns = {}, exec co in global_ns, local_ns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s showing us where the code objects are.  Just fragments, not everything defines a code object.  You get these trees of code objects, with the module the outer code object.  Good use of pointers for assignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you instantiate a module, you get this &quot;knitting&quot; among code objects, assembled into a constellation of objects (not all of which are code objects).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The object tree is what&#39;s in the .pyc file.  The namespace assembles the code object starting with the root node, throws that away, gives us the new namespace in sys.modules.  You don&#39;t get your function objects until post-execution.  The body of a class is actually a function.  The post-execution view is closer to what my level understands, so its good to see pre-execution diagrams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Generators keep the local namespace around, but functions and methods throw it away.  A closure is a nested scope.  My way of returning a derivative function (from a function) is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/stickworks.py&quot;&gt;a good example&lt;/a&gt; of closure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s giving some really excellent code examples, going by lickity-split.  These slides &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.pycon.org/2009/conference/schedule/event/7/&quot;&gt;better be on the web someplace&lt;/a&gt;.  I need to come back to this stuff, think about it some more.  globals() is locals() -- when is this true?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6651099944173819346'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6651099944173819346'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/about-python-namespaces.html' title='About Python Namespaces'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-927789347536530116</id><published>2009-03-25T08:03:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-03-29T14:33:49.020-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Google App Engine</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m learning more about cloud computing this morning.   Hey, YouTube is coded in Python, didn&#39;t know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;J.C. Gregorio is taking us through the app.yaml file (don&#39;t use /_ah/ or /form).  You fall through the rule set.  List the top level handlers, what to skip, caching rules.  Not everything in your tree has to be mentioned though.  Specify whether a login is required and, if so, must it be admin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Django 0.96 is the current default templating language, but you&#39;re not forced to use it.  Use os.path.dirname(__file__) to build an absolute path to our template file.  We&#39;re getting questions about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.makotemplates.org/&quot;&gt;using Mako&lt;/a&gt; instead of Django.  I found some stuff &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.pansapiens.com/2008/06/24/mako-templates-in-google-app-engine-seems-to-work-for-me/&quot;&gt;in the blogs&lt;/a&gt; about that.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/upgrade-the-django-templating-system-to-jinja2/&quot;&gt;What about Jinja2&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lars is here from the Mozilla development team.  He&#39;s been working on a crash detector that phones home (sends httpRequest) with a binary payload, with Python doing the analysis on the server.  Mozilla is able to monitor, in quasi-real time, where their browser is breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read PEP 333 to get a better handle on WSGI, which supersedes CGI.  The SDK includes a lightweight version.  We&#39;re moving quickly here, as the datastore is what&#39;s most important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The datastore is an &quot;entity store&quot;.  It&#39;s not an RDBMS.  You can&#39;t do joins.  GQL is the new language, based on SQL but different.  Subclass db.Model and create your properties, setting defaults (e.g. auto_now_add=True for db.DateTimeProperty).  The writes probably take longer than you&#39;re used to, given the redundant write stipulations (like the Hadoop, you&#39;ll have x3 replication).  Update the same entity about 5 times a second, but as many entities as you like in parallel.  Reads are very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0OqBvcgXLRnxuRG9wL_q_9kjXGYbTq9EaQeKxES24tOOQgF50Yyvs8UlalWrY4OAcNFwDP1urkIwCJw4t0Vf7tF3yWLEwX_AG3FRnt-lBFLAB9BuVqTTOV4IEUwn0foWxIw_h/s1600-h/appengine.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 120px; height: 30px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0OqBvcgXLRnxuRG9wL_q_9kjXGYbTq9EaQeKxES24tOOQgF50Yyvs8UlalWrY4OAcNFwDP1urkIwCJw4t0Vf7tF3yWLEwX_AG3FRnt-lBFLAB9BuVqTTOV4IEUwn0foWxIw_h/s320/appengine.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5317141811228951442&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got stuck trying to store and read the above GIF in a model blob property, couldn&#39;t get it to work.

We have the more dog like, the dwarf like, the geek like... the elvyn like.  Every Middle Earth has its lore and its peoples, its nations, its guilds &amp;amp; ethnicities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Astrological birth signs brought some order to the scene.  Personality types -- people are big into measuring those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone wants to be a goth (and you don&#39;t have to be one to love one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of our shared genome providing needed plasticity, adaptability, I&#39;d say the record proves we&#39;re well endowed.  That doesn&#39;t make us masochistic however.  Let&#39;s not invite stupid outcomes. Let us not &quot;just see what it&#39;s like&quot; to survive &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/search?q=Hiroshima&quot;&gt;another nuclear holocaust&lt;/a&gt; how about it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keith talked about a new Van Allen Belt thanks to nuclear testing.  In sweeping the web, I see lots of caveats and denials.  It&#39;s gone now they say.  Some people got angry about those tests and I can see why: those testers don&#39;t own the world, merely act like they do (= bad acting).  That level of hubris is ugly to behold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see some of those races people believe in.  They&#39;re less transient than cloud formations certainly.  Others I don&#39;t see or am less likely to want to believe in.  I&#39;ll suspend my disbelief, but only by so much.  Call me a skeptic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I believe the lunar landings (Apollo) really happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we start arguing who is racially &quot;pure&quot; (archetypal) versus who is &quot;mixed&quot; (mongrel) I tend to walk away, unless we&#39;re talking about breeds of horse or dog maybe (seems harmless enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t trust the judging or judges where humans are concerned.  They start making it matter, make it more than a show.  Yet there&#39;s no &quot;racial essence&quot; in the DNA anywhere.  Pigeon holing, or coming up with percents (&quot;the mix&quot;), is a nightmare, a quagmire, and an exercise in futility sometimes.  Pseudo-science takes over, pandering to some &quot;master race&quot; mythology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is such a thing as taking racial categories too seriously, kind of how I felt about the WTO. I liked it &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/yes-men-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;when &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Yes Men&lt;/span&gt; poked holes&lt;/a&gt;.  Not every story has the same half life, just like not every open source project achieves critical mass or long term momentum.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8572009325482996126'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8572009325482996126'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-race.html' title='More on Race'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-4257052054359590302</id><published>2009-03-21T13:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-03-23T19:45:43.120-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Noodling and Doodling</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m sitting at the big table at Pauling House, yakking with Drs.

So why bother learning what&#39;s slated to fade away?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the contrary, I contend, we&#39;ve made approximately zero progress towards removing human intelligence from the picture, nor are the smarter shops, like Pixar, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;even trying&lt;/span&gt; to make all cartooning &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/04/philosophy-posting.html&quot;&gt;an AI project&lt;/a&gt;.

I don&#39;t like to hover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m reminded of tour guides I&#39;ve enjoyed in exotic destinations like Shanghai and Guangzhou (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chinadiscover.net/china-tour/guangdongguide/guangdong-guangzhou-train-hongkong.htm&quot;&gt;training from Hong Kong&lt;/a&gt;, ate snake soup that one time), &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/intourist-pdx.html&quot;&gt;Tashkent&lt;/a&gt;... they met our plane or whatever conveyance, made sure we weren&#39;t looking the &quot;wrong way&quot; when crossing the street, then set us free, remaining on standby to ask questions, lead a foray if called upon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As aliens, we weren&#39;t allowed just anywhere, unless we had a proper escort.  In Bhutan, that meant special papers.  Bhutanese are a generous people, yet &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/public-schools-overseas.html&quot;&gt;understandably leery&lt;/a&gt; about wannabe landlords trying to muscle into the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another role model:  James Lambert, high level escort for the State Department.  He was major league, would go all over the country with visiting dignitaries, like that newspaper editor from Zimbabwe, the neice of the DL.  Finding people to talk to is a challenge sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not everyone is as gregarious &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/borat-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;as Borat&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I recall that Thanksgiving, our Tibetan guest here in town, a lot of the guys just wanting to huddle around the TV and watch NFL or whatever, whereas I know plenty of women who&#39;d&#39;ve given their eye teeth to be in that room talking with such a deeply spiritual person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James was quiet to the point of invisible, and debonair, as you&#39;d expect.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/methodist-morning.html&quot;&gt;Maureen&#39;s family&lt;/a&gt; made the connection, likewise to &lt;a href=&quot;http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1539F934A3575BC0A96E948260&amp;amp;sec=&amp;amp;spon=&amp;amp;pagewanted=1&quot;&gt;the late Admiral Crowe&#39;s family&lt;/a&gt; (another hat guy).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8295938594693844630'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8295938594693844630'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/chauffeur-duty.html' title='Chauffeur Duty'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2095679706990221639</id><published>2009-03-15T09:45:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-03-15T14:44:40.795-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Nine Lives (movie review)</title><content type='html'>Here is one of those gems where it pays to watch the Special Features and listen to the writer-director Rodrigo Garcia, producer, actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nine Lives&lt;/span&gt; themselves focus on nine women, their names starting each featurette as the curtain rises.  I&#39;m a Sissy Spacek fan, so was led in to this rotating sequence of exhibits by her name on the marquee, to discover many marvels, in terms of capable, strong, intelligent performances.  I liked seeing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460651/&quot;&gt;sheriff from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Invasion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; again, now deaf, yet still attracted to this squid of a woman (gorgeous and well played by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000312/&quot;&gt;actress Amy Brenneman&lt;/a&gt; with just the right distance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1086543/&quot;&gt;The girl Samantha&lt;/a&gt; trapped between two parents who always say the same things was especially claustrophobic.  As a casual drop-in, one has the luxury of knowing it&#39;ll be over soon, not so for the imprisoned.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/dog-tubes.html&quot;&gt;Nonhumans&lt;/a&gt; didn&#39;t have much of a role in any of these scenes, in itself a source of claustrophobia for me.  Like where are &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/animal-rights.html&quot;&gt;the horses&lt;/a&gt;, the snakes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, the writer is skilled at coming up with these puzzles (seemingly insoluble).  The mom behind bars, wanting to talk with her daughter (but the phone was broken) was especially poignant as well.  The woman about to have surgery, lashing out at the guy...  Sissy got to be in two of the sketches.  The meeting in the supermarket (two people pushing carts) &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/surge.html&quot;&gt;took me back&lt;/a&gt; to a scene in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/02/valentines-day-2006.html&quot;&gt;George Tenet&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; stormy book, although neither character was pregnant in his version (a similar &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language&quot;&gt;pattern language&lt;/a&gt;&quot; though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I remarked during the viewing (not too loudly I hope), this was all very theatrical in flavor, didn&#39;t feel like &quot;a normal movie&quot; and the reason is obvious:  each vignette, though rehearsed, is shot as a mini-play, a sustained 14 -17 minute take (mas o meno).  You can be 10 minutes into a perfect performance and flub somehow, have to start again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standard procedure is to edit together all the best bits, but in theater one doesn&#39;t have that luxury, and as the producer reminds us, this very low budget effort had only nine shooting days to get it right, 17 total, basically two days per ordeal.  I say &quot;ordeal&quot; because it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/05/sky-camp.html&quot;&gt;really challenging&lt;/a&gt; to dive in to a script like this, with steadicams dancing around, but on the other hand it&#39;s the kind of work thespians really enjoy, as you get to live the character and scene, aren&#39;t tasked with the exhausting chore of &quot;chopping it up&quot; into 5-30 second takes so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for putting on great skits and inviting us back stage after the performance.  You&#39;re wonderfully skilled people.  Thanks for adding this to the stacks.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2095679706990221639'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2095679706990221639'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/nine-lives-movie-review.html' title='Nine Lives (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-73518431526971804</id><published>2009-03-12T21:44:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-03-12T21:47:09.955-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Busy Busy</title><content type='html'>I just got off the phone with someone at Yale (she called me), having placed &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/34&quot;&gt;my OS Bridge proposal&lt;/a&gt; in the hopper.  We&#39;re looking to attract an out of town audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Nick scoured &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Powell&#39;s Books&lt;/span&gt; on Hawthorne last night and came up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Nobby-Conversations-Norman-Brown/dp/156279132X&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Walking With Nobby&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an ultra-cool find (I promptly bought it, so he could peruse as my guest, leave it for me).  Nobby is the late Norman O. Brown, author of a kind of aphoristic glue language important in my formative years, helped tilt me towards Princeton philosophy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/philosophy-101.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Kaufmann&lt;/a&gt; etc.  Later, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/applewhites.html&quot;&gt;E.J. Applewhite&lt;/a&gt; showed me where he&#39;d added &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Love&#39;s Body&lt;/span&gt; to his Georgetown apartment collection.  NOB has links to Wittgenstein too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razz, my &quot;welcome wagon&quot; (for chauffering guests around Portland), is overdue for some maintenance.

I&#39;m somewhat distracted.  Dr. Nick is on his way, drove him to Union Station this afternoon.  I&#39;ll start reading that book now.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/73518431526971804'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/73518431526971804'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/busy-busy.html' title='Busy Busy'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
