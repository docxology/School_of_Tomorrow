Her choice: Sandy River by way of Edgefield. We took this trip, and her mood greatly improved, as did mine. Scenic Troutdale was fun to drive through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the river, which we drove to after walking around the golf course, admiring the fresh plants (plus a wedding was getting ready to happen), having lunch, a big sign warned of drowing deaths, I think 12 since 1993.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many. Life guards were on duty, and an ambulance was parked nearby. But I&#39;m sure this level of support can&#39;t be arranged 24/7. Kids will swim nude, drunk, or dive off the bridge. Grownups have their own problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The circling hawks were spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a few minutes, I&#39;ll join Matt and Mike for a beer. Mike has a new used car. We haven&#39;t the three of us gotten together since my birthday. I&#39;m coming back early though, as Dawn wants to celebrate the solstice with some good friends while I look after Tara. That&#39;s perfectly OK with me -- recharging one&#39;s batteries is an important part of life, especially during holidays.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111914293825143331'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111914293825143331'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/06/day-at-river.html' title='A Day At the River'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111834520831594976</id><published>2005-06-09T12:25:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:44.076-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Dad Guy</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/640/dadguy2sm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 2px;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/320/dadguy2sm.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Me at Powell&#39;s.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Photo taken by Derek using the new&lt;br /&gt;5.0 megapixel Olympus Stylus 500&lt;br /&gt;(same one mom took to England)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hat: from Princeton reunion, hand made in Ecuador&lt;br /&gt;Shirt: ActiveState company shirt, a gift from OSCON&lt;br /&gt;Pants: basic jeans with lots of pockets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111834520831594976'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111834520831594976'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/06/dad-guy.html' title='Dad Guy'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111820729403301304</id><published>2005-06-07T22:06:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:44.009-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Happy Birthday Tara</title><content type='html'>We celebrated at the Spaghetti Factory down by the river.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111820729403301304'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111820729403301304'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/06/happy-birthday-tara.html' title='Happy Birthday Tara'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111694626051861338</id><published>2005-05-24T10:52:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-12-25T14:23:20.345-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Tree House</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/640/P5240019.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 2px;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/320/P5240019.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tree House&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to be back in &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/11/view-from-height.html&quot;&gt;Cary&#39;s and Theo&#39;s tree house&lt;/a&gt; last night. I took Continental from PDX to EWR, public bus to Newark&#39;s Penn Station, PATH to WTC, subways from Chambers St. to 88th on the west side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had dinner with David Lansky and his two boys, Ben in college, Sam in high school, and with Arthur Siegel, an active co-participant on &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/&quot;&gt;edu-sig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We discussed, among other things, the role of technology in the curriculum, the relevance (or lack thereof) of math courses. Sam shared his dissatisfaction with math courses that give no real depth, are entirely about doing well on some final test (in his case the IB exam). He once asked his teacher about some concept, and she told him not to worry about it, because this concept wouldn&#39;t be on the exam. Ben is seriously into English at Haverford, but assured us that many of his classmates are bona fide math and science geeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal was to make the 8:20 PM Amtrak to Rhinecliff, but I missed it by a couple minutes, trying to type my name on this touch screen interface at 34th St. Penn Station. So I hopped a subway to Times Square and took the cross-town shuttle (S), to Grand Central (enjoyed the wireless in the waiting area, with a $2 can of Bud). The Metrolink North on track 37, departing 10:02 PM for Poughkeepsie, brought me close enough for poor sleep-deprived Stu Quimby (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/tale-of-two-toymen.html&quot;&gt;a Toyman&lt;/a&gt;) to come fetch me, and bring me to the tree house.

We see many foreshadowings that he&#39;ll be losing his grip, but not before he takes on the world and changes it significantly, and for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To keep the storyline manageable, and maybe because the yet youthful DiCaprio would not seem quite believable as an old man, we never get to the concluding chapters in Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congressman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bangornews.com/news/templates/?a=109262&amp;amp;z=224&quot;&gt;Brewster&lt;/a&gt;, well played by Alan Alda, was actually banking on Hughes snapping under pressure, making a public spectacle of his managerial incompetence. But this plan backfires. Fighting to keeping TWA on the map, versus a greedy Pan Am, contributes mightily to Howard&#39;s sanity. Here&#39;s a simple game with obvious villains. Hughes is restored to health by fighting in this political arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie-star women, though more complex than the greedy guys, are still a source of sanity in his life, though his mother takes a hit for maybe contributing to his ill-defined germ phobia (I understand Tesla had a similar problem -- or was it a fear of being poisoned?). My favorite line in the film: Ava Gardner walks into this apartment he&#39;s been flipping out in, sees tape connecting everything to everything (I&#39;ll guess this was a screenwriter fiction) and says with droll humor as she pours herself a drink: &quot;I love what you&#39;ve done with the place.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then of course we have the airplanes, the simplest creatures of all (which the screenwriters compare with the women at least superficially -- both sleek). The planes are Howard&#39;s chief conduit to the exhilarating world of unforgiving physical principles versus human engineering and a desire to master them. When the plane, the woman, and bottled milk all come together (Katherine Hepburn at the wheel, high above Hollywood), he&#39;s in his element at last.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111625504897157389'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111625504897157389'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/05/aviator-movie-review.html' title='The Aviator (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111465238771970716</id><published>2005-04-27T19:02:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:43.685-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Oswego 2003</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/640/normal_13680.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 2px;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/320/normal_13680.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Oswego 2003&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve just been perusing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.looknfeel.com/photoblog/index.php?cat=2&quot;&gt;photo-blog&lt;/a&gt; chronicling the &lt;a href=&quot;http://snec.cjfearnley.com/snec.meeting.2003.06.html&quot;&gt;SNEC Summer Workshop&lt;/a&gt; in Oswego, New York, June, 2003.

I could see dispatch sending a vehicle like this to some curriculum/circus event, to which I might be sent as well, in a bizmo we could actually sleep in. Coordinating resources is key.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The general Project Renaissance philosophy involves government working with NGOs, because they&#39;re on the cutting edge, pioneering new technologies in ways corporate R&amp;D budgets might never directly support. Yet usable, commercializable ideas derive from such pioneering, so the money is in theory well spent (in practice there&#39;ll be some waste).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When humanity is hurt or damaged, control rooms spring into action and provide relief, which makes for good reality TV. Of course historically, humans haven&#39;t really worked as a body, as large groups typify other groups as pathogenic, and teach their children to perpetuate these views. Humanity has some kind of auto-immune disorder, like lupus or something, causing it to keep attacking itself. Project Renaissance attempts to overcome this disorder. The tsunami relief effort was a step in the right direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of bizmo-based reality TV, I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/patcroce/index.php&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pat Croce Moving In&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the monitor at the gym today, close captioned, as I burned calories on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.precor.com/comm/en/efx/546i/&quot;&gt;Precor EFX546i&lt;/a&gt;. This guy travels around in a bizmo, parking next to homes and getting involved in family dynamics, trying to help out and fix stuff. I&#39;d call that prototypical of what I&#39;m scheming to see -- I&#39;d just like more of a geek channel overlay, i.e. a focus on technology and engineering, in addition to whatever soap opera family dynamics. Plus Croce&#39;s bizmo&#39;s interior is too much the suburban ranch style home for my taste (not &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt; American dream).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111420940012698469'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111420940012698469'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/04/more-bizmo-news.html' title='More BizMo News'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111405489709596176</id><published>2005-04-20T20:41:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:43.501-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Mythos</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/640/berus1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 2px;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/img/254/1836/320/berus1.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cornelia with her pet Berus&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Tara&#39;s toy chest.

The membership churns out a lot of in-depth, well-researched reports in answer to various policy questions coming from Congress and federal agencies. Occasionally a report will have a classified appendix (meaning it&#39;s not accessible to the general public), but for the most part, these studies are all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nap.edu/&quot;&gt;available on-line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme of Dr. Wulf&#39;s lecture was C.P. Snow&#39;s &quot;chasm between the two cultures&quot; by which Snow meant the humanities on the one hand, and the technology fields on the other, the latter being characterized by their heavy emphasis on mathematics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas the idea of &quot;two cultures&quot; is easy to grasp, sometimes it makes more sense to break it down further, and Wulf outlined differences between science and engineering, which are indistinguishible in the middle, but also define two extremes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Engineering is different from science in its emphasis on creating new phenomena, versus simply studying existing ones. Engineers create, bring into existence, design. As such, Wulf considers them to have more in common with artists than with many scientists. He wants to communicate this to new generations, so that creative, imaginative students don&#39;t buy into some silly stereotype of the engineer as some nerdy cog in the machine who doesn&#39;t think about the concerns of real people or topics within the humanities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This difference has also been a key part of ISEPP president Terry Bristol&#39;s philosophy, so I found it interesting to have them both addressing our pre-lecture on this issue (a small gathering of teachers met with Dr. Wulf ahead of time, in the Heathman Hotel). Terry pointed out that the US Constitution may be viewed as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html&quot;&gt;product of engineering&lt;/a&gt;, a blueprint or circuit diagram, complete with &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005_02_01_controlroom_archive.html&quot;&gt;feedback loops&lt;/a&gt;, load balancing and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the dinner afterwards I commented that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/synessay.html&quot;&gt;Dr. R. Buckminster Fuller&lt;/a&gt; also wrote a lot about C.P. Snow&#39;s famous lecture, and that one way of bridging the chasm is to treat Fuller within the sphere of the humanities, as a New England Transcendentalist for example, and a poet, and then follow his threads into geometric and engineering domains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I brought up Dr. Donald Knuth at Stanford, who suggested we fight overspecialization by becoming competent in at least two fields, preferably quite far apart. In Knuth&#39;s case, this would include his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0895792524/002-5534072-8368000&quot;&gt;foray into theology&lt;/a&gt; (a humanities topic, rather different from computer science, in which discipline he&#39;s considered a giant).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked Dr. Wulf (who has a background in computer science) if he liked this model: you don&#39;t get to consider yourself well educated or accomplished in the liberal arts, if you don&#39;t have fairly well-developed competence in at least two disciplines, one from each side of C.P. Snow&#39;s chasm. Dr. Wulf pointed out that Dr. Knuth was also an accomplished organist, that few attain such stature in even one discipline, let alone more than one, but yes, aspiring to competence in at least two widely spaced disciplines was a good idea and he was all for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/power-skating-with-ceo.html&quot;&gt;Don&lt;/a&gt; was in high gear last night, helping organize the pre-lecture and handling logistics, including the transfer of Julian&#39;s sculpture &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Unraveling Collagen&lt;/span&gt; from the neighboring Performing Arts Center to the lobby of the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall -- and back, after the lecture. Featuring &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/01/going-down.html&quot;&gt;Julian&#39;s work&lt;/a&gt; was a great idea for this lecture in particular, as it bridges C.P. Snow&#39;s chasm very effectively and intelligently.

George had us brainstorm around getting use from the RedHat 9 lab. I sat there with the Toshiba trying to remember how Jerritt set it up, but could only get access to Coffee People across the street (weak signal). I&#39;ve forgotten the details (though I still have his network diagram -- which doesn&#39;t include passwords, so I&#39;m not going to be sysadmining any time soon (which is for the best -- better HPD should sysadmin, vs. just driving taxi)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The grand finale was a tour of the new cybervan out back, just arrived, pure white, no decals. It&#39;s a 5th wheel, no power of its own, except a propane generator (right?) for the electronics, which include 3 TV consoles in three sections (back, middle, front -- side door into middle). Plus there&#39;s a Windows box using the giant satellite dish up top. One of the cops was playing with that, apparently getting signal. George waved towards some pickup in the lot that&#39;s supposed to haul this thing. It must be strong, because this thing obviously weighs quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current plan is to have the 5th wheel available in the parking lot for a summer camp experience -- kids in groups of 44 or so, with a snack station and rotating among workstations. The 5th wheel might be one of the workstations (the lab another, a couple other rooms talked about). As for how it gets deployed to more remote locations, that remains to be seen. The Washington County Fair that happens every year is a no-brainer, but the point is to keep it busy all year. That means more content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the open source angle plays out remains to be seen. George is pretty committed to Linux from a finances point of view (thinking of kids wanting to own their own computers), but that&#39;s not to overly discriminate against everyone else. The cybervan serves wireless, so if a non-Windows notebook shows up and wants to patch in, that shouldn&#39;t be a problem, provided proper authorization is obtained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the Max to and from, hauling the Toshiba Satellite A60 and reading my various computer magazines.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111285251392906725'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111285251392906725'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/04/hpd-cybervan.html' title='HPD Cybervan'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111207314604375027</id><published>2005-03-28T20:53:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2011-06-22T15:52:22.877-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Python for GIS Experts</title><content type='html'>I&#39;ve been cramming for days to lead this 3 hour training for GIS professionals at an annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.orurisa.org/events/gisinact/2005event/&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/a&gt;. As it turns out, you can&#39;t really cover Python in all its glory in 3 hours, i.e. when 5 o&#39;clock rolled around, I still hadn&#39;t spent much time discussing how to open and read files. We covered some more advanced topics instead: generators and decorators. Going by partial feedback, at least some in the audience had fun, found me dynamic enough as a speaker. I&#39;m pretty good with quips and asides, keeping things fairly light and moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But really, today was more an education for me. I soaked up a lot of info about the state of the art when it comes to geoprocessing and geographic information systems (GIS) -- good stuff for a Global Data CEO to know about. ESRI is the 800 pound gorilla in this knowledge domain. They&#39;re moving to Python for a scripting language in their flagship product (ArcGIS) which is how come I was a speaker at the Doubletree Hotel, Lloyd Center, Portland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lunch time talk was excellent. The speaker, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pacificsurvey.com/&quot;&gt;Doug Divine&lt;/a&gt;, played a major role digitally surveying both submarines of Civil War vintage (talking USA history here). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hunley.org/&quot;&gt;The Hunley&lt;/a&gt;, a confederate vessel, is the one most people know about, but the Yankees had their &lt;a href=&quot;http://history-sites.com/mb/cw/cwnavy/index.cgi?noframes;read=473&quot;&gt;own sub&lt;/a&gt;, which was repurposed to pearl diving duty after the war and ended up all washed up on some island near Panama City.

Turns out Prague is a major capital in FoxPro world (a world I share with the Dabo guys); maybe I&#39;ll get back there one of these days.

Although I published the idea to the web in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/hypertoon.html&quot;&gt;1996&lt;/a&gt;, only recently have my programming skills intersected available technology (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&quot;http://vpython.org/&quot;&gt;VPython&lt;/a&gt;)  such that I could write a working prototype.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll be sharing about it at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/pycon/2005/&quot;&gt;Pycon 2005&lt;/a&gt; next week in DC.  Looking forward to seeing Glenn and his family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking ahead to that, I tried the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/python/hypertoons/&quot;&gt;the app&lt;/a&gt; on the family laptop (1.2 Ghz Compaq Presario) and found the results &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/21182&quot;&gt;disappointing&lt;/a&gt;.  The family budget is tight (no &lt;a href=&quot;http://animal.discovery.com/&quot;&gt;Animal Planet&lt;/a&gt; or new fish tank accessories for Tara) -- because dad spends all his time pushing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/03/consolidation-phase.html&quot;&gt;Bucky stuff&lt;/a&gt;, work nobody pays him for (except precessionally, which counts) -- but I couldn&#39;t see a way around ordering up a new (refurbished) laptop.

Don is refreshingly low key with his approach -- the antithesis of L. Ron Hubbard (another guy with a boat).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We talked about some successes in our lives, and the processes contributing to them. Mine was getting back into teaching, which I enjoy. That teaching job at St. Dominic Academy (Jersey City) was one of my all time favorites, if challenging. Getting that Saturday Academy gig last summer with the HPD&#39;s George Heuston the ex FBI guy, and co-teaching with Linux guru Jerritt Collord, was a breakthrough for me. I shared about the police chief being a son of Chinese immigrants, and wanting to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7852597&quot;&gt;reach out to Latino youth&lt;/a&gt;, among others, to bridge the digital divide -- hence that computer lab at West Precinct (Hillsboro). The relationship with Saturday Academy continues (and HPD).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Others had interesting success stories as well (which they might tell, if so moved). I got some good feedback from Bruce when I shared my a plan to recruit master teachers into this alternative lifestyle centered around roving teacher-mobiles (specially outfitted RV-like jobbers), coordinated and supported through some OnStar-like headquarters. Bruce told me about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.futurliner.com/account.htm&quot;&gt;GM&#39;s Parade of Progress&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of traveling roadshow designed to clue kids about new technologies. And this was pre Sputnik, and in an age that was bolder (some would say more naïve) about its futurism.&lt;br /&gt;

If I ever get a bizmo, I might name it &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Meliptus Junior&lt;/span&gt;, in honor of Don&#39;s boat (a floating bizmo) and his role in my life as a master teacher.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111095115916725285'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111095115916725285'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/03/wanderers-meeting-2005315.html' title='Wanderers Meeting 2005.3.15'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111077644660456129</id><published>2005-03-13T21:09:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:42.987-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Update from PDX</title><content type='html'>Peter Ward was in top form for the ISEPP lecture (center ring, name on the marqee). He did his best to recruit scientists and engineers from a young audience, astrobiologists in particular (though during the Q&amp;A, a rep from our own university system challenged kids to check out Oregon&#39;s offerings -- and Ward graciously responded with a question about why both states do such a poor job of ignoring their most important institutions: their universities)). He really appreciated how we attract so many of the high school set, not just fuddydud peers with already-formed views and established careers. He expressed his deep appreciation to Terry for making that happen, and Terry in turn credits the Mentor Graphics Foundation, and Corporation, both sponsors, with the former earmarking funds directly for K-12 participation in the ISEPP series. Don did the intro. Dinner after, then drinks in the bar (The Heathman does a very good job).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I got to meet Fr. Bob, who has a cool campus setup, a spare yet well-equipped office. Ki Master George, an 8th grader, took Fr. Bob on a tour of a blog KI&#39;s serving, using bascially a LAMP configuration, though without the MySQL. Fr. Bob appeared delighted with the technology, and plans to keep it current with new postings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put aside most of an entire day to finally implement my Hypertoon concept in running code. Someone had it running in Germany (or was it Austria) within hours of my posting it. This thread goes way back with me, to like 1996, but to get a working source code version has had to wait for the programming environment to come within my reach. With Python 2.4 and VPython as an add-on, I was able to get a prototype out the door. I showed it to Tara and she came up with some excellent ideas for improvements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My congratulations to Darren and Cristy on their wonderful wedding ceremony, conducted in high Quaker style. The spouses married one another with powerful promises, then affixed their names in the presence of a large gathering. We all lined up to add our signatures as witnesses after the Meeting for Worship had ended. During worship, friends and relatives offered kind words of encouragement, recollections, expressions of gladness, and advice. Darren&#39;s bro had planned a dynamite menu of two spanikopitas (rural and urban), many other delicacies. The music, which the groom had a hand in supervising, was highly eclectic. A good time was had by all -- including me, taking the full brunt of an early spring allergy (Benadryl helps). Dawn and I walked to and from the event, which was associated with a nearby park. We were reminded of our own wedding, which took place in similar Quaker style, also outside in a park setting. We likewise have such a certificate, signed by ourselves and our friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Update:&lt;/span&gt; I&#39;m feeling skeptical these days that my bizmo&#39;s responsibilities will allow it to stay as compact as I first imagined. On the way to the wedding, Dawn and I passed a rig that I used to think was about the right size, but when I mentally sketch in the internals, the shell ends up expanding a bit. Still, I refuse to tow an SUV. I want maneuverability. Plus there&#39;s the caravan option, or bizmos converging from different directions. Mine could be more compact if some of the bigger circus stuff gets driven by others, and shows up where it&#39;s needed. Many permutations are possible.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111077644660456129'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/111077644660456129'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/03/update-from-pdx.html' title='Update from PDX'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-111017823963795063</id><published>2005-03-06T22:50:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:42.919-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Journal Entry de Jour</title><content type='html'>Well, my back isn&#39;t back to normal yet -- still paying for that splat at the roller rink.

A cool bizmo gets a cameo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick was waiting outside the theater on this warm-for-February Academy Awards night. I shared my sense Ayn Rand would&#39;ve liked this film about extraordinary individuals caught up in an oppressive &quot;no powers allowed&quot; mediocracy (like Harry Potter &amp; friends escaping muggles through Hogwarts), but Nick mainly just liked the good family vibes, a scarce commodity in his scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not a big Ayn Rand reader, mostly just &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/span&gt; in like 8th grade (looked interesting, plus I detected raised eyebrows among the adults). I was much more into Freud (called him Frood until people figured out whom I meant). My friend Trevor, a true scholar, has been studying Ayn&#39;s &#39;n Bucky&#39;s thinking for signs of convergence/divergence, plus he&#39;s dug into the technocracy movement with gusto (found a great video).

He hails from Singapore, is an Austrialian citizen. He and Derek joined us at the Bagdad. I sampled the Dry Irish Stout but stuck with my favorite: Hammerhead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just walking to the Bagdad had been a chore, as we&#39;d been roller skating again, and this time I managed to wipe out big time. Some lower back muscle got very unhappy and is still giving me grief almost 24 hours later. The power walk up to Hawthorne was part damage assessment. I explained RSA along the way to keep my mind off the sharp stabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy just brought over some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Asia/Singapore/Singapore-1495679/Off_the_Beaten_Path-Singapore-Haw_Par_Villa_Tiger_Balm_Gardens-BR-1.html&quot;&gt;Tiger Balm&lt;/a&gt; patches, plus I&#39;m doing ibuprofen. I expect to be back to normal shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I remarked on at our booth was this bottle of vitamins I&#39;d just picked up enroute to the skating rink, sporting a green label against a reddish background. The green part says &quot;Super Crusade&quot; while the purplish red background says &quot;Trader Darwin&#39;s&quot;. I found this an interesting juxtaposition of contrasting memes -- and passed out vitamins to whomever wanted &#39;em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of crusades, over on Quaker-P some scholarship (not mine) has unearthed a meaning of &lt;em&gt;jihad&lt;/em&gt; amenable to Quakers. In fact, Bayard Rustin&#39;s &quot;speak truth to power&quot; might be construed as a reasonable translation of something Mohammed likely said: that to speak truth in the presence of a tyrant is what jihad is all about.

Indeed this is weird weather for us, but not unenjoyable. I&#39;ve just been sitting out at a favorite cafe with Nick, getting briefed on the Amory Lovins talk of two nights ago.  Fabik, freshly back from Mexico, joined us for lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biofuels could be big in Oregon, especially considering how many trucks we make. OSU has already done a lot of the planning. Lovins is a 787 fan, sounds like (new Boeing model). Speaking of Boeing, another headline in today&#39;s paper: JetBlue is to start a nonstop service from PDX to JFK, using state of the art Airbuses (every seat has its own DVD LCD).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night we watched the full moon rise over the Columbia, anchored off PDX. At dusk, that tower looks like something straight out of a science fiction novel, or maybe &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/span&gt;.  So what&#39;s with those billowing black smoke fires again?  They&#39;ve been happening for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Friday night, Dr. Philip Clayton did the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isepp.org/Pages/04-05%20Pages/Clayton.html&quot;&gt;ISEPP lecture&lt;/a&gt;, talking about the levels of discourse separating emergent levels of complexity. Philosophy floats atop science, with a lot of value-laden verbiage, and that&#39;s OK. As human beings, we&#39;re entitled to traffic at a higher level than reductionism might justify and nail down within empirical simulations. Life at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/02/on-edge-of-chaos.html&quot;&gt;edge of chaos&lt;/a&gt; is just like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After wine and dinner, I asked him about the Tower of Babel i.e. isn&#39;t it part of the design that we don&#39;t get totalitarian closure i.e. Universe always seems to escape complete systematization? It&#39;s a question I didn&#39;t get to bring up with Lyn &amp; Dorion in the Hawthorne Pauling House that time (Terry did most the talking) -- was thinking about them cuz Clayton played us a DVD clip from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118884/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during his multimedia presentation (also a clip from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;2001: A Space Odysseey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; -- the chimps&#39; meetup with the obelisk).  Anyway, yes, Philip thinks the Tower of Babel is semi-real.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110927853748783173'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110927853748783173'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/more-wanderings.html' title='More Wanderings'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-110875279213050395</id><published>2005-02-18T12:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:42.592-08:00</updated><title type='text'>More BizMo Source Code</title><content type='html'>I haven&#39;t specified my bizmo in great detail because my plan is to field test a standard issue model, not a one-off, so that lessons learned have wider application than to just my team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, a Google recruiter with family aboard wouldn&#39;t have the same features as a roving clinic and dispensary, or environmental quality tester. I imagine a typical class hierarchy per Java, with bizmo interfaces extending various subclasses of RV and touring coach, known quantities from whence the bizmos derive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise I likely wouldn&#39;t own said bizmo. I envision the fleet having corporate ownership, with scheduling and maintenance more centrally managed. Just amassing a personal fortune, buying an RV, and outfitting it accordingly would unnecessarily delay the evolution of shared infrastructure, complete with control rooms providing OnStar-like support services. The whole point is to grow a fleet within a larger deployment plan. Bizmos do real work, after all. I&#39;m not planning an early retirement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the extent our source code remains a public good, early adopters such as the UN, various NGOs, could port, customize, and further develop the software. Competitive commercial ventures might add proprietary features. Making much of the infrastructure free, including access to relevant GIS, would stimulate the corresponding hardware market, with many multiplier effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the USG has a history of strategically encouraging investments with ripple effects, I could see the NSF getting involved, among other agencies. Or maybe we should look at pioneering this whole business in Japan. There&#39;d be a large export market. I&#39;d be happy to field test various Made in Japan technologies. Nor must we think either/or. And yes, I hear you Korea.

Most of his talk focused on clever ways of using colored lasers, mirrors and digital filters to tease telling imagery from the body&#39;s surface and  innards.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110849023611727733'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110849023611727733'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/wanderers-meeting-2005215.html' title='Wanderers Meeting 2005.2.15'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-110841321677372571</id><published>2005-02-14T23:59:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:42.459-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Pay Day!</title><content type='html'>Yes, it&#39;s a red letter day, and not just because it&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/02/valentines-day-2006.html&quot;&gt;Saint Valentine&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just deposited a Portland State University (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/shanghai-city.html&quot;&gt;PSU&lt;/a&gt;) check made out to me (taxes withheld), a Fuller Schooler, for my work with Saturday Academy as an adjunct faculty member. I teach at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI), using a classroom belonging to Oregon Health Sciences University (OHSU).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Saturday, I used our projector to eye our classroom from further out, using Microsoft&#39;s Terraserver. We also played with new Elastic Interval Geometry applets, and went over some entry level group and number theory using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.python.org/sigs/edu-sig/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, a nifty computer language.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, I completed an intro to Fuller&#39;s concentric hierarchy of polyhedra, embedded within its &lt;a href=&quot;http://cst-www.nrl.navy.mil/lattice/struk/fcc.html&quot;&gt;CCP&lt;/a&gt; context (if you&#39;re thinking &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linuxhotbox.com/fun/linux-wallpaper.171.htm&quot;&gt;CCCP&lt;/a&gt; instead, don&#39;t worry about it -- wires cross sometimes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the amperage is low (this was a token sum), the point is: a switch has been thrown and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://msnbc.msn.com/id/6968256/&quot;&gt;current&lt;/a&gt; is flowing. This is a &quot;go live&quot; milestone along our critical path. A cool new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html&quot;&gt;circuit&lt;/a&gt; for our Motherboard Earth has commenced operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Followup:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it turned out over dinner (we ate out as a family) that Dawn had been reading about Hildegard of Bingen. Without having read this blog entry, she brought up the importance of the color green in Hildegard&#39;s writings, and connected this to her own query &quot;where&#39;s the green?&quot; in a recent empowerment circle -- for her, an uncharacteristic use of slang (she was asking about travel money).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told her later how satisfying it was to hear all this green talk, having just written a blog entry that was thematically red -- including a subtle Biblical allusion that most wouldn&#39;t see. The juxtaposition of red and green, and of sacred and profane imagery, made for some interesting paper-into-gold alchemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of checks, of course the Catholics have been paying me for years, through Saint Dominic Academy and later Saint Vincent Hospital. The breakthrough celebrated above was not the brute fact of getting paid, but rather the new set of university affiliates connecting up with the Fuller School to promulgate a new, higher quality curriculum.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110841321677372571'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110841321677372571'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/pay-day.html' title='Pay Day!'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-110805067613357242</id><published>2005-02-10T06:41:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:42.398-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Pentagon Channel</title><content type='html'>I caught up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/day-in-pdx.html&quot;&gt;Ron&lt;/a&gt; by cell yesterday around 5:24 PM; he was on a ferry back from a job interview in Victoria, BC. I phoned to clue him in about the upcoming segment on CBS about Willie Nelson&#39;s biodiesel bizmo. After quitting Collaborative Technologies at Free Geek, Ron dove head first into biodiesel, by volunteering at a local refinery and upgrading the family car. He&#39;ll view my tape when he gets home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later that evening was another Python meetup at the Lucky Lab. Like last month, I showed up with one of Tara&#39;s stuffed snakes, so new registrants would be able to identify our table. This time, none of us were new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scott, who goes back a long way in computers, has been implementing this dynamite search algorithm (I forget its name) which he claims outperforms just about any other when it comes to pawing through gigabytes of text. I&#39;ve put him in touch with police at the computer forensics lab in Hillsboro, as he needs raw intelligence about how to fine tune his presentation. I&#39;ll also mention his project at an upcoming Wanderers meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both Ron and Scott are running low on fuel, as each pursues a dream. They&#39;re both risk-taker capitalists, using their heads to score a net gain for themselves and others over the long haul. Speaking of capitalists, even our little Dawn Wicca and Associates is implementing stricter fiscal discipline these days, given new costs: we&#39;re cutting &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/happy-bday-sarah.html&quot;&gt;Sarah&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; day care at the Howladay Inn and sticking with Comcast&#39;s basic package, which includes lots of home shopping, but no &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/span&gt; and no &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SciFi Channel&lt;/span&gt;.  Maybe we&#39;ll get Pentagon&#39;s new service at no extra charge (not counting taxes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/school-business.html&quot;&gt;Fuller School&lt;/a&gt; knows all about doing more with less and has been moving ever further towards doing everything with nothing since Bucky died in 1983. This school is about as lean and mean as they come I&#39;d hazard. Our network is strong and continues to make inroads. Our access to timely global data is increasing exponentially. So in the long term, I have every confidance that our risk taking will pay off handsomely, in terms of real wealth (= life support, actual and potential) for omnihumanity -- plus for dogs, wolves, tigers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html&quot;&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt; and like that.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110805067613357242'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110805067613357242'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/pentagon-channel.html' title='The Pentagon Channel'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-110783644362475983</id><published>2005-02-07T20:19:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:42.336-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hotel Rwanda (movie review)</title><content type='html'>This was a powerful film. I left in a daze, leaving my OSCON bag at my seat, full of library books. The ticket taker was sympathethic when I went back for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the rest, I&#39;ll just cut and paste what I posted to Quaker-P (some listserv I subscribe to off and on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Dear Friends,&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I am also planning to see the film, Hotel Rwanda,&lt;br /&gt;&gt; although with some trepidation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just saw it. Some Belgians suckered the Africans into believing in this distinction between Hutu and Tutsi, even though it made no sense. A lot of senseless killing ensued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll ask the same thing I asked David Niyonzima -- why not throw away these silly identifications and create a new ethnicity called &quot;Hutsi&quot; to which everyone belongs. Of coures it&#39;d be arbitrary and silly -- just like before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly those American satellites can&#39;t tell the difference -- and never will. Senseless killing they see, and record, no matter who does it (lets just say they&#39;re &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;all&lt;/span&gt; Americans and be done with the senseless divisions, how &#39;bout it?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to the social security administration today, to get a replacement card. Against my better judgment, I checked the &quot;white (not hispanic)&quot; box on the SS-5 (I figured it&#39;d raise fewer eyebrows at the desk -- I&#39;m at the mercy of those bureaucrats).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But of course I&#39;m Asian to the core (duh).  Or maybe Native American.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PSU (a local school that pays me the big bucks) had a more enlightened form: I checked the &quot;declined to identify&quot; box. That was the least confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110783644362475983'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/110783644362475983'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/hotel-rwanda-movie-review.html' title='Hotel Rwanda (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
