&lt;br /&gt;
The Victorian escape to another astral plane was through death, with spiritualism persisting on into the time of Thomas Edison.&amp;nbsp; Technology and the lore of outer space, extraterrestrials, were beginning to gain a firm foothold and meld with the old plot lines.&amp;nbsp; An out of body experience would take you to Mars.&amp;nbsp; Your Earth body would lie, vulnerable, like a corpse, while you experienced your superpowers (and limitations) in a next life, with new love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carter clearly thinks beyond the grave already, as he continues to feel a bond to a partner in a former life, one we see the end of.&amp;nbsp; We understand Carter&#39;s bravery as a kind of no longer caring, as if giving himself over to the dream of life, in despair, not caring that much when it&#39;ll end.&amp;nbsp; People see him as crazy.&amp;nbsp; He barely holds his world together.&amp;nbsp; A spider, a cave, gold.&amp;nbsp; Not much to go on.&amp;nbsp; No friends.&amp;nbsp; A drifter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lying motionless in that cave, as if bitten by a snake, he takes on another life.&amp;nbsp; One could easily see it as a projection of the stories he&#39;s learned as a boy.&amp;nbsp; Roman soldiers.&amp;nbsp; Chariots.&amp;nbsp; Great battles in the plains.&amp;nbsp; The beginnings of airships.&amp;nbsp; The beginnings of large scale machinery, mixed with the delicacy of optics.&amp;nbsp; All these fragments of his 1800s existence make it to his next life.&amp;nbsp; He is once again a hero.&amp;nbsp; He celebrates loyalty, bravery and compassion among the peoples of another planet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The moment he realizes he&#39;s on Mars is reminiscent of that moment in &lt;i&gt;Idiocracy&lt;/i&gt;, when it all comes together for our protagonist.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s the problem of going back, whether this would ever be possible.&amp;nbsp; The new world has its own attractions, its people, its problems.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s the temptation to stay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The really powerful bald guys that seem to orchestrate everything, masters of disguise, are reminiscent of the Q in &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; They know about all the worlds, including Virginia in the post Civil War era.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Outwitting these guys (their women not shown) is part and parcel of the human heritage; our destiny (or calling) is to rival the angels in bringing glory to God.&amp;nbsp; We demonize those whom we hope to surpass.&amp;nbsp; To just be the puppet of the angels, without rising to their level of authority and immortality, is what spineless sell outs would do, and hence our human enemies (not as noble as ourselves).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So is this really Mars, or are we just talking about &quot;a next world&quot;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the Victorian themes of poison, even suicide, a need to find lost love, the theme of death cannot be avoided, nor is it.&amp;nbsp; Edgar himself is dying and going to heaven in inheriting fantastic wealth.&amp;nbsp; His uncle urges him to a life of adventure.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/passing-torch.html&quot;&gt;I phoned &lt;i&gt;Free Skool&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this morning on the Martian Math front, having done &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/browse_thread/thread/94a8482cef9b72ed&quot;&gt;four new sketches&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;i&gt;Scenarios Training&lt;/i&gt; (a kind of Esozone workshop).&amp;nbsp; The content is actually quite easy, a distillation, so it&#39;s more about andragogy (where adults are concerned), new pedagogy.&amp;nbsp; People who think we don&#39;t still invent new teaching techniques this late in the game are wrong.&amp;nbsp; The technology keeps changing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tara phoned me from Indiana, having a good time.&amp;nbsp; She relays light switch commands regarding Barry-the-snake.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melody is feeding Sarah-the-dog.&amp;nbsp; Someone found it funny recently that we gave our animals people names.&amp;nbsp; But then we think of people as animals, some of us do, not really a separate category when it comes to their physicality.&amp;nbsp; When I do object oriented programming, I&#39;ll subclass a Human off a Mammal as readily as a Monkey or Pig.&amp;nbsp; Or Dolphin (thinking of Sean&#39;s spanking new Wittgenstein class at the moment).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How does &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/03/radical-math.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Free Skool&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; relate to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/domes-future.html&quot;&gt;OPDX&lt;/a&gt; if at all.&amp;nbsp; Did I mention the call failed to go through?&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s unusual, these days, for a number to just ring and ring.&amp;nbsp; Before voicemail, which was often a table top box, new life for cassettes, we had more of those &quot;endless ring&quot; scenarios.&amp;nbsp; People harassed each other with those, clever mammals that they be.&amp;nbsp; A lot of high tech is about restoring privacy, backing off, mainly through the technique of asynchronous routing.&amp;nbsp; Reflection required.&amp;nbsp; Text me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using the $ symbol in tandem with kwh is not new -- that&#39;s how an electric bill reads.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s the &quot;energy has shape&quot; dictum which takes use to space-filling phenomena, such as photons and protons.&amp;nbsp; These can be metered and a charge attached to each one.&amp;nbsp; The idea of a dollar as an energy amount is no stranger to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html&quot;&gt;General Systems Theory&lt;/a&gt; crowd (smart mob).&amp;nbsp; The sun floods us with energy, most of which is reflected back into space, luckily for us.&lt;br /&gt;

Our Python group is meeting tonight but having just come from Pycon, I feel my internalized OS is saying Pauling House.&amp;nbsp; So here I am.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The topic is antisemitism, one could say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;il&quot;&gt;Wanderers&lt;/span&gt; welcome Wanderer, Marianne Buchwalter, at 7:00 PM on Tuesday evening, March 13, at The Pauling House, 3945 SE Hawthorne, who will present and discuss her experiences of her family&#39;s departure from Berlin four days after kristallnacht, in 1938.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her uncle had arranged to exchange houses and belongings with a Nazi sympathizer who lived in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marianne documented this story in her 1995 book: Memories of a Berlin Childhood. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/849vaos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/849vaos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hope to see you there!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I tried to get a word in edgewise, but we&#39;ve got a full house and lots of people with stuff to say.  Fortunately, I have my blogs and am happy to resort to asynchronous commentary.  My new self-discipline is to only answer when asked (one of Fuller&#39;s too as I recall).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m fairly optimistic that Judaism has made good enough friends in Asia, among Buddhists especially, that there&#39;s really no danger of another upwelling of classic Hitlerism or one of those.&amp;nbsp; When it comes to highly literate, scholarly cultures that control lots of assets, the Jews are not alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How much total fissile material do we need for nuclear medicines and so on?&amp;nbsp; This is a side conversation I&#39;m trying to have while blogging at the same time.&amp;nbsp; I assume Iran is aiming for the medical market big time.&amp;nbsp; A &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/outreach-to-japan.html&quot;&gt;Japanese version&lt;/a&gt; of Global Data might have some figures (Japan has a lot of interest in health care).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The conversation has somewhat gone off the rails, but that&#39;s OK.&amp;nbsp; Wanderers are known for their meandering style.&amp;nbsp; Google Drones?&amp;nbsp; Lots of interesting chatter.&amp;nbsp; Some visitors here tonight, not just the usual crew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lindsey and I walked up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3182545429/&quot;&gt;to Belmont&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, as I made good on a belated birthday gift to get her some lenses, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/industrial-scale.html&quot;&gt;an up-to-date eye exam&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; She lost her specs shortly after we met and has been doing without.&amp;nbsp; As she ventures forth into the world, those lenses might come in useful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I&#39;m interested in knowing is whether Marianne has as high an opinion of Chaim Potok&#39;s writing as I do.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;The Chosen&lt;/i&gt; was a big influence on me, helped get me into Freud and psychoanalysis as a future discipline, with the move to philosophy in the 1970s (there&#39;s a lot of shared lineage, through the Vienna Circle and Frankfurt School, to name a couple relevant switchboards).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, I checked out &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portnoy%27s_Complaint&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Portnoy&#39;s Complaint&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; but wasn&#39;t that big a fan.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/flash-back.html&quot;&gt;Woody Allen&lt;/a&gt; fits in here somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had snow on the ground this morning.&amp;nbsp; Portland is definitely in a different bioregion than Santa Clara.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lew us here.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;d been to the Quaker Men&#39;s Group.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve gone in years past.

&lt;br /&gt;
Paul steered clear of my philanthropic games with profiles, an open business model, possibly because it&#39;s not really in startup phase as a concept -- the ideas are all ancient (&quot;potlatch economics&quot; an influence). &amp;nbsp;I imagine the specifics of game design, coffee shop floor plans, locations, aesthetics, gift shops (Avalon another influence), will emerge in different frequencies (tied to ethnicity).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Stormy Peters from Mozilla challenged the developers in the room to keep the Internet open and free, by which she meant opening sharing how personal data is used. &amp;nbsp;Transparency doesn&#39;t necessarily mean a lack of privacy, but does mean a more equitable sharing of what&#39;s being collected in some cases, especially where the general public is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I just came from the PSF members lunch in Magnolia Room. &amp;nbsp;Michelle was there, the first member I&#39;ve sired, having been nominated and elected in relatively recently myself. &amp;nbsp;I sat with Eric Jones of Enthought out of Austin, and a guy from Google / Amsterdam responsible for deploying Python on Google&#39;s machines. &amp;nbsp;A guy from RangeSpan was there as well. &amp;nbsp;This was just one table of a great many. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The PSF has way more corporation members than the AFSC does already. &amp;nbsp;Both are non-profits with international reach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m hitting some of the most introspective talks meaning focused on the language itself. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/399/&quot;&gt;Raymond Hettinger&lt;/a&gt; looks a lot like George Clooney I think. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/352/&quot;&gt;Jack Diederich&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Stop Writing Classes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was awesome, as was &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/126/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interfaces and Python&lt;/i&gt; by Eric Snow&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Sorry &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/45/&quot;&gt;Jeff Rush&lt;/a&gt; was out sick.&amp;nbsp; So was Jesse a lot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quite a few new babies this year, some of them with us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The imams and rabbis I attended to were looking at the depths of the language. &amp;nbsp;Learning how to create synthetic functions, classes and even modules on the fly: &amp;nbsp;the subject of Walker Hale&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/380/&quot;&gt;meta-programming talk&lt;/a&gt;. The previous talk &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/131/&quot;&gt;on writing decorators and context managers&lt;/a&gt; was also helpful to me in my work as a teacher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These talks should be coming out on video later.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2601725111733429987'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2601725111733429987'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/03/pycon-2012-day-one.html' title='Pycon 2012 Day One'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-4867136300679619049</id><published>2012-03-02T15:41:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2015-01-31T12:42:07.875-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Remembering Baryard Rustin</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The family story here is that my dad was struggling with the mandatory ROTC program. &amp;nbsp;He&#39;d helped staff a troop ship to Japan and stuff the year before, but now he was in his junior year at University of Washington and having moral qualms. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bayard Rustin came to Seattle to talk about conscientious objection and that helped crystallize a lot of Jack&#39;s ethics. &amp;nbsp;While he stayed quiet about religion most of the time (he was a rather quiet man, though not out of shyness), he soon became a Quaker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6957543373/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;The documentary about Bayard&lt;/a&gt; was really good. &amp;nbsp;Lots of excellent archival footage, good editing, clear sound -- a professional job, and a valuable review of the civil / human rights movements. &amp;nbsp;The Rufus Jones room was packed. &amp;nbsp;The panel discussion afterward was quite intelligent and featured Walter Naegle, Rustin&#39;s partner later in his life, and Hal Weaver.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My question was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House&quot;&gt;about Freedom House&lt;/a&gt;, in the news lately vis-a-vis Egypt. &amp;nbsp;This brought up some discussion of what groups were getting CIA money at the time, leaving open the question if Bayard was aware of some connection there. &amp;nbsp;I also wondered if Bayard was friends with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/kiyoshi.html&quot;&gt;Kiyoshi Kuromiya&lt;/a&gt;, also a gay rights activist and an associate of Martin Luther King&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The occasion here, in part, is the AFSC Board has recently restored Rustin&#39;s name to &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/SYNERGEO/conversations/messages/20211&quot;&gt;Speak Truth to Power&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;a publication he&#39;d helped write. &amp;nbsp;His name had been removed earlier because Quakers were having a problem with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbc2NaLuv1A&quot;&gt;his gayness&lt;/a&gt; back then.&lt;br /&gt;

The people who call themselves &quot;American&quot; should meet more criteria than just having a passport I think.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think we should flip it: &amp;nbsp;all those hard working &quot;undocumented&quot; people just trying to make a better living are now &quot;the citizens&quot; whereas anyone who has paid serious taxes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/02/lame-analysis.html&quot;&gt;the mutinous war machine&lt;/a&gt; should be considered an illegal alien. &amp;nbsp;The so-called &quot;citizens&quot; have failed to protect their democracy or restrain their leaders from committing atrocities. &amp;nbsp;They are not entitled to keep her. &amp;nbsp;The undocumented will likely do a better job (even as many are getting documents, plus storing their genomes in SQL/noSQL).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, the American people (newly defined) are mostly undocumented and innocent of war crimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The illegals (mostly of Anglo-Euro heritage) have been complicit in these dirty wars and are only citizens because they&#39;ve bullied the rest of us into thinking of them that way (I&#39;m Anglo-Euro-Asian perhaps).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps a coalition of the undocumented and those who still have values and principles will continue to push back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who knows, brave democracies might grow here in fertile Columbia once again (no, not named for Columbus, who was already named for something).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
One of the nuke plants in Iran is getting more focus while the others (same grid for all intents) are whirring away under the radar, replenishing illegal weapons stocks and/or just doing their civilian jobs.&amp;nbsp; No I&#39;m not talking about North Korea.&amp;nbsp; The IAEA clearly needs help though, especially in India where nationalism remains a leading &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7668593&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;mental disease&lt;/a&gt; (a complex).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not sure how much of Iran&#39;s 20% pure is slated for space program uses.&amp;nbsp; Civilian nuke plants on the Moon, tiny ones that might be removed, are less likely than in the orbiting accommodations for space tourists and researchers.&amp;nbsp; The dangers are similar to those with submarines, as tainting the oceans with nuclear waste would be equally irresponsible and BP-like. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I expect there&#39;s some serious mole power in the IAEA, given the training and heritage, even though the leadership appears bought and paid for (perhaps &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; has a story -- on my list).&amp;nbsp; The made-for-TV version might start in Colorado, some kind of NORAD place, where the anti-human stockpiles are tracked, as are their ant-like minions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Scott Ritter and/or &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/fire-and-ice-korean-war-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Muhammad Ali&lt;/a&gt; could serve as personas to draw from, if you&#39;re in screen writing.&amp;nbsp; The weapons inspector plays &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/11/hurt-locker-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;a more heroic role&lt;/a&gt; these days, thanks to nuke weapons having &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/12/countdown-to-zero-game.html&quot;&gt;lost all PR value&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Only stinkers cherish them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/mycartoons/cartoon3.html&quot;&gt;The &quot;nuclear club&quot;&lt;/a&gt; is for the wretched of the Earth -- so it&#39;s somewhat surprising that India is pounding at the door, its pride wounded for not being among the morally reprobate.&amp;nbsp; The stuff of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/arabs-gone-wild.html&quot;&gt;comedy and spoof&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; At least Iran has &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/psy-war-whos-losing.html&quot;&gt;a sense of decorum&lt;/a&gt;, reminding the world of a possible future, one of zero tolerance for weapons of mass suicide.&amp;nbsp; Religions that preach the opposite, like Christianity by the looks of things, is too Jonestown-like for my taste.&amp;nbsp; Humans weren&#39;t meant to be so aberrational in that way -- seems unnaturally violent and perverse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Enslaved humans, trapped in a criminal underground, serving Dr. Evil types as they develop their &quot;systems&quot; for monied sociopaths, is the stuff of melodrama for sure.&amp;nbsp; Cigars and whiskey, 007, hookahs... the movies could be boringly formula in no time, all adopting a predictably retro look as we move more assets to Havana and/or to Portland with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/02/yacoubian-building-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;its retro theaters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get the &lt;i&gt;WSJ&lt;/i&gt; at Blue House, a physical paper wrapped in plastic.&amp;nbsp; I took it to breakfast this morning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The headline was about an aggressive nuclear (bankrupt) state trying to play overlord on the backs of preyed-upon civilians.&amp;nbsp; The military had seized control of the intelligence apparatus and had pre-emptively attacked a neighboring state on false pretenses.&amp;nbsp; Here, WDC was going down to defeat yet again, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/double-feature.html&quot;&gt;a Loserville&lt;/a&gt; for pro losers by this time, in part because perceived as a Wall Street pawn, a Saruman sell-out to Mordor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The USG might still &lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/archives/117&quot;&gt;bounce back&lt;/a&gt; in some way shape or form.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d suggest in competition with &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html&quot;&gt;the faux capitalists&lt;/a&gt;, so afraid of competition and so protective of their antediluvian &quot;economics&quot;, a step child of the social sciences and statistics.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GST uses a stronger science and recruits stronger players.&amp;nbsp; The more trusted banks are almost by definition distancing themselves from the sleazier wheeler dealers who want to reap a killing selling basement fallout shelters or the modern equivalent.&amp;nbsp; Preying on people&#39;s fears:&amp;nbsp; you can smell those businesses a mile away.&amp;nbsp; They traffic in terror.&amp;nbsp; Why lend them your reputation then?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the history books and comic books (e.g. &lt;i&gt;Captain America&lt;/i&gt;), the USG (or some avatar thereof) still had some juice when countering the most craven.&amp;nbsp; Has that influence been spent?&amp;nbsp; Have the neocons and neoliberals destroyed America&#39;s reputation?&amp;nbsp; I think we still have &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/02/tell-truth-and-run-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;pockets with integrity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, that&#39;s probably too much optimism for one blog post.&amp;nbsp; The reality on the ground is far more sobering.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fashion section of the WSJ was more interesting than the shrill headlines.&amp;nbsp; I notice more women than men in the creative / imaginative sectors.&amp;nbsp; The dullards stream into safe commands and park there, apparently, supposing their investments are safe because their bankers read the same papers they do (and maybe get more out of them?).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mostly, when mom isn&#39;t here, we just recycle them.&amp;nbsp; Lindsey is somewhat horrified by the waste, but then that&#39;s her chosen role.&amp;nbsp; The dog walks have been helping, and we recycle the plastic.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8447250654474782849'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8447250654474782849'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/02/reading-wsj.html' title='Reading the WSJ'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7220568869738887645</id><published>2012-02-22T19:02:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2012-02-22T19:02:47.681-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Neighbor Talk (Global Village)</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m pleased with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/msg/e26edcd63304582c?hl=en&quot;&gt;ODEC crew&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;
 The trainer said she was a little too hesitant, thinking of 
possibilities, but then ultimately you&#39;ve just gotta do the deed.&amp;nbsp; I 
know what he meant.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s been a stunt driver on &lt;i&gt;Leverage&lt;/i&gt; and teaches police how to high speed chase.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We
 were doing a make up driving, focus on lane changing, having missed a 
session thanks to permit placement error.&amp;nbsp; My role was to drop and pick 
up.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, I have VPN from any wifi spot, so had productive time 
at a &lt;i&gt;Starbucks&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know I sound like I&#39;m getting paid for brand placement, but it&#39;s more that I voluntarily &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/msg/bbc728897e8dcd3c?hl=en&quot;&gt;register some of the crews&lt;/a&gt;
 (yar!).&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t do paid work for spin doctoring.&amp;nbsp; I 
participate in the exchange of values and valuables, mindful of a 
responsibility to preserve and protect heritage.&amp;nbsp; That would include 
work &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6919830985/in/photostream&quot;&gt;by Crumb&lt;/a&gt;, celebrated at &lt;i&gt;Laughing Planet&lt;/i&gt; on Belmont.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watching &lt;i&gt;Sherlock Holmes&lt;/i&gt;, this latest one, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/02/tintins-great-adventure-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Tintin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 back-to-back has likely had a searing effect on remaining neurons.&amp;nbsp; 
They say those get replaced more than they used to lead us on.&amp;nbsp; Anyway, 
whatever.&amp;nbsp; On steroids, these guys (Tintin and Sherly).&amp;nbsp; Smarter than 
Rambo though, more 007 flavored, yet not gun happy really.&amp;nbsp; I liked 
their getting more girls into it, like in those funny spy movies awhile 
back (the one with &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/good-shepherd.html&quot;&gt;TinkerPuff &lt;/a&gt;or whomever).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was exulting about that funny &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/07/wanderers-20110705.html&quot;&gt;Vin Diesel movie&lt;/a&gt; set in Brazil, as I was reminiscing with Steve tonight, about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/07/oscon-2011-continues.html&quot;&gt;things Brazilian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;

We ended with Tara piloting the Maxi Taxi through &lt;i&gt;Ladd&#39;s&lt;/i&gt;
 up Harrison onto Lincoln, back to Harrison and into our driveway -- a 
little fast but because I gave the wrong instruction.&amp;nbsp; Walker the 
friend-in-residence still co-owns the car per DMV and was duly consulted
 to get clearance for these maneuvers.&amp;nbsp; The learner permit was on our 
presence at all times.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7220568869738887645'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7220568869738887645'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/02/neighbor-talk-global-village.html' title='Neighbor Talk (Global Village)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3123366317081145240</id><published>2012-02-17T20:00:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-06-04T22:16:05.051-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Wandering in PSU</title><content type='html'>PSU has a truly handsome campus, newly outfitting with a &lt;i&gt;Rogue Hall&lt;/i&gt; we noticed (and partook, somewhat hurriedly between gigs). &amp;nbsp;I spent some hours away from my desk haunting the halls of academia, bouncing around in buildings I do not normally frequent. &amp;nbsp;Other Wanderers were doing the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roger Paget was holding forth in a rather well packed large room. &amp;nbsp;Glenn, Don and I were a little behind schedule, coming in on the 14, then walking to this far corner of Portland State. &amp;nbsp;Roger has divided his time between North America and the Indonesian archipelago over the span of some 40 years, and has come to accumulate some wisdom. &amp;nbsp;We&#39;d come to pick up on some of it, having met with him &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wanderers-20091013.html&quot;&gt;at Wanderers&lt;/a&gt; a few times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, next gig, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6895228543/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;Jeff Goebel&lt;/a&gt;, recently moved to Albequerque, is living the dream as a top management consultant. &amp;nbsp;This was one of those workshoppy environments where people stand and represent things, verging on theater. &amp;nbsp;We&#39;re involved in the process, are part of the cast. &amp;nbsp;The study was about meeting in circles and facing our fears. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d say this counts as a significant town hall meeting, a true cross-section, as I was anticipating having &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/11/endgame.html&quot;&gt;in Endgame&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Well done, then. &amp;nbsp;I was admiring the cynic about all these &quot;active listeners&quot; trying to make it all better in the Middle East, out of some sense of mission maybe (she&#39;d just come back from there).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding Roger&#39;s talk, I saw his Jakarta as &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7672097&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;a mirror for WDC&lt;/a&gt; and think he saw it that way too at some level. &amp;nbsp;He has internalized the geological long-now aspects of government, embodies the &quot;unto seven generations&quot; type thinking. &amp;nbsp;I hear he&#39;s revered in Bali, and no wonder. &amp;nbsp;He&#39;s a bit of a Bucky-like character in that way, also appreciated on that circuit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last night I dipped into the &lt;i&gt;Telluride Mountain Film Festival&lt;/i&gt;, a touring collection of cinematic wonders giving us the state of the art in &quot;life at the limits&quot; films. &amp;nbsp;Guys freezing their butts off in Pakistan, kayaking the Congo (&lt;i&gt;Kadoma&lt;/i&gt;), exploring the length of the Colorado to its new and recent death zone, where the delta used to be (talk about big deltas!). &amp;nbsp;The last one, of a cyclist showing off, is already out there, a &lt;i&gt;Red Bull&lt;/i&gt; offering, and is marvelously well put together, and so deeply appreciative of the scenery (while really living in it). &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/Cj6ho1-G6tw&quot;&gt;Way Back Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m on duty again around midnight, MVP to PDX. &amp;nbsp;In the meantime, I have desk duties to attend to, raising a Python army. &amp;nbsp;Blue House personnel are hard at work -- working on beats (rhythms, prophecies).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Milt has the same mission I thought I had, back in those &lt;i&gt;Voodoo House&lt;/i&gt; meetups, to &quot;save Systems&quot; at PSU. &amp;nbsp;I think he&#39;ll do a good job and hand over the reins. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve got the GST thing to keep plying. &amp;nbsp;Milt was another one of us present at the workshop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I noticed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6895228827/in/photostream/&quot;&gt;Steve Johnson&lt;/a&gt; is an upcoming speaker in that same colloquium. &amp;nbsp;His name came up in the &lt;i&gt;Portland Tribune&lt;/i&gt; again recently, in connection with &lt;i&gt;p:ear&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;He and I go back, to the mid-1980s, when I first moved to Portland and ended up with CUE. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d definitely be at his presentation except that I&#39;m expecting to be in California that day.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Buzz and Brian seem to be getting along on the Wanderers list, a list that&#39;s frequently contentious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These athlete geeks have recognizable geek traits, such as an interest in equipment, brand loyalty in some ways. I could see &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/esozone-2011.html&quot;&gt;Red Bull&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; as an overlap memeplex maybe.

&lt;br /&gt;
Although I always work towards the back, I have a more immediate response to newcomers (better than same day service). &amp;nbsp;So it&#39;s not a queue, and not a stack. &amp;nbsp;Not exactly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Restaurant waiting has similar queuing theories. &amp;nbsp;You can wait for a bill, talk, enjoy family (the owner knows you&#39;ll not regret it), whereas if you&#39;re a party of three, waiting for a table, there&#39;s a lot of priority, perhaps even a radio frequency controlled device, such as &lt;i&gt;Spaghetti Factory&lt;/i&gt; has, along the Willamette River (lots of new construction).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I enjoyed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eaipatterns.com/ramblings/18_starbucks.html&quot;&gt;this analysis of &lt;i&gt;Starbucks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which I found at &lt;a href=&quot;http://strataconf.com/strata2012&quot;&gt;the Strata site&lt;/a&gt;, this being a major data conference, lots of overlap with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/02/calendar-dates.html&quot;&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt; in terms of theme, speakers and management.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One perk of the job is we have musicians and artists in the building (and cooks!) -- like an art colony. &amp;nbsp;I also have enough bandwidth to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://somafm.com/&quot;&gt;SomaFM&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Mission Control&lt;/i&gt; is a way of enjoying Apollo Project successes, listening to audio from missions against the backdrop of spacey music.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tonight I&#39;m keeping company with the chairman as he preps for a class in Minnesota (he&#39;s the trainer). I was invited but have my train conducting. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a good time to be looking at OSCON talks (I&#39;m on the selection committee, my second year). &amp;nbsp;As I was mentioning, there&#39;s overlap with Strata, which latter, like the upcoming Pycon, is in Santa Clara (California), near San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of Silicon Valley, my Mac Air shipped with Cupertino the default time zone. &amp;nbsp;I thought that was cute. &amp;nbsp;We also &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/redmonds-mirth.html&quot;&gt;talk about Redmond&lt;/a&gt; as a HQS, in geekdom. &amp;nbsp;You&#39;ll notice how cities play against one another as capitals, cities that don&#39;t get to play on &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/wanderers-20061212.html&quot;&gt;the Elephant &amp;amp; Donkey board&lt;/a&gt; (pay yes, but play not so much).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/v6NDOv-3I38&quot;&gt;David&#39;s screencasts on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;, in between keeping up with the other syllabi. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wikieducator.org/User:KirbyUrner/Syllabus#Movies&quot;&gt;DVDs&lt;/a&gt; have the same status as books sometimes, in the sense of &quot;required&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/02/yes-men-fix-world-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Keeping up with coursework&lt;/a&gt; is another aspect of my job. &amp;nbsp;Lots of acronyms to memorize, always. &amp;nbsp;Namespaces abound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I used some of the time to seed &lt;i&gt;edu-sig&lt;/i&gt; with a spate of postings, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2012-February/date.html&quot;&gt;bam bam bam&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Cherlin batting the shuttlecock right back to me, extolling the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2012-February/010560.html&quot;&gt;virtues of LISP and APL&lt;/a&gt;, ever the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/04/richard-stallman-at-psu.html&quot;&gt;geek preacher &lt;/a&gt;(amen, brother).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6980892154204412286'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6980892154204412286'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/02/work-habits.html' title='Work Habits'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-8902414551325880068</id><published>2012-01-29T22:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2014-08-27T21:48:21.101-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Fidel: The Untold Story (movie review)</title><content type='html'>I&#39;ve not been to Cuba.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/05/sunny-day.html&quot;&gt;My friend Glenn&lt;/a&gt; has, several times, in connection with his work &lt;a href=&quot;http://cdi.org/&quot;&gt;for CDI&lt;/a&gt; and such.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve taken to crafting a brand of science fiction that&#39;s rather close to investment banking in some ways, and Cuba appears in that, growing its ties with the European and Canadian firms that &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/artifact.html&quot;&gt;have a slice of the US economy&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This file was itself distributed by &lt;i&gt;Mongrel Media&lt;/i&gt;, which is more aimed at Canadians than &lt;i&gt;Movie Madness&lt;/i&gt; in Portland, but DVDs get around.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;First Run Features&lt;/i&gt; is also a distributor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m motivated to see other Estela Bravo documentaries.&amp;nbsp; She gets talking heads you don&#39;t see in just any documentary.&amp;nbsp; Philip Agee, Angela Davis... Harry Belafonte, and of course Fidel himself, speaking candidly with the director (not a screen presence).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also get great footage of Nelson Mandela, Ted Turner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/11/game-night.html&quot;&gt;Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/u2.html&quot;&gt;Nikita Khrushchev&lt;/a&gt;, Mike Wallace, Jack Nicholson, Malcolm X, the Pope and many others.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/01/blog-launch.html&quot;&gt;Lots of Che&lt;/a&gt;. When it comes to having a front row seat on history in the making, Fidel has that &quot;box of chocolates&quot; guy beat (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/04/castaway-movie-allusion.html&quot;&gt;hello Tom Hanks&lt;/a&gt;), without being such a drifter.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s a world leader we&#39;ve been lucky to have in many dimensions, making the 1900s a little less of a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like Muhammad Ali, Fidel was seriously disappointed he didn&#39;t get to meet Ho Chi Minh, though he did get to Vietnam, against which &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/wanderers-2006830.html&quot;&gt;USA presidents&lt;/a&gt; were squandering lives, as prisoners of collective fantasies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Islands have different dynamics than vast contiguous landmasses, like continents.&amp;nbsp; Always speaking of the USA as &quot;a giant&quot; to the North reinforces this sense of a monolith, but that&#39;s largely an illusion of statism.&amp;nbsp; As Roger Paget was pointing out &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wanderers-20091013.html&quot;&gt;at Wanderers&lt;/a&gt;, shipping patterns have changed in Indonesia to where no one port controls all the others (a new pattern).&amp;nbsp; Statism is giving way to more organic evolutionary patterns in many dimensions.&amp;nbsp; We go around the embargo by importing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cubagov.cu/&quot;&gt;web site bits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Relations with Cubans is a proposition Oregonians are free to explore independently of New Yorkers or citizens in the District of Columbia or Guam (both non-states).&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s some irony in having the highly interconnected space of private companies (with private jets) re-shaping capitalism and doing social engineering at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m interested in building Portland&#39;s reputation as &lt;a href=&quot;http://hollywoodtheatre.org/education/workshops/&quot;&gt;a source of anime&lt;/a&gt; and manga, and see the University of Havana as a possible ally in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cuba is well positioned to stay a trusted brand in ecologically aware tooling and investing, as well as schooling, medical care and disaster relief (lots in common with Portland).&amp;nbsp; We shall see.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8902414551325880068'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8902414551325880068'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/01/fidel-untold-story-movie-review.html' title='Fidel: The Untold Story (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-9086385427099548215</id><published>2012-01-28T17:41:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-28T18:54:31.523-08:00</updated><title type='text'>On Air</title><content type='html'>&lt;br /&gt;
I missed Glenn&#39;s presentation at Wanderers, owing to the serious leak in my upstairs bathroom, and my needing to work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.micksplumbing.com/&quot;&gt;Mick the plumber&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I was pleased to learn that Nirel had contributed her professional services and recorded the proceedings. I&#39;m hoping to catch it on Youtube one day soon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For you Lindsey fans out there who check these blogs mainly to find out about her, I am pleased to report she&#39;s blissing out with her drum machine. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some complain drum machines &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-years-day.html&quot;&gt;are soulless&lt;/a&gt;, but that might be said about any instrument. &amp;nbsp;She&#39;s made check lists of all the features and made sure to use each one. She has researched the lore connected with this model, including about the machines emulated within. &amp;nbsp;Her research helped me decipher the reference to &quot;808&quot; in that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/cywar-in-cyberia.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boom Boom Pow&lt;/i&gt; number&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The 808 was a drum machine. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her nickname for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3949999261/&quot;&gt;this machine&lt;/a&gt; is R2 (as in R2D2) and she loves it dearly. &amp;nbsp;Her process is to create drum tracks for three entire albums before going back to add keyboard and vocal tracks. &amp;nbsp;This is what&#39;s going on in my basement, amidst the occasional flooding or rat visitation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is my first posting from the new work computer, a Macbook Air, pretty sleek. &amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t have the reflexes for this machine yet, POSIX-based though it may be. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m liking it though, and plan to be a quick study.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve got a couple vids from&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Movie Madness&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to take in, one on Fidel, the other on birds. &amp;nbsp;More details later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Proving I&#39;m a USA citizen is the new language game. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve got another I-9 to do, but in setting aside my expired passport and SSN, I think I might have pushed them off the radar. &amp;nbsp;The current plan is to show up at the Social Security office downtown on Monday with my driver&#39;s license. &amp;nbsp;It looks that that might work, in which case I can meet the deadline and FedEx the forms, per Kathleen&#39;s request.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lindsey is a huge popcorn fan, with or without the videos / movies. &amp;nbsp;She jumped into this pose as a statement of her approval, half in spoof of herself for so doing. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s a 25 pound bag of popcorn on the left, sea salt, and oil. &amp;nbsp;The basic ingredients of life.&lt;br /&gt;

Simon was offering some of his accumulated stuff as giveaways at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?PropertyID=12&amp;amp;action=ViewPark&quot;&gt;Colonel Summers Park&lt;/a&gt; last night. I grabbed a &lt;i&gt;Make:&lt;/i&gt; magazine. He said he once had a whole collection of those. His DIY bike trailer, made from a ladder, with a custom hook, is paradigm DIY in my book. Simon lives the dream, as do many on this FNB circuit.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Having this world class library of books by and about both of these guys certainly works to my advantage. &amp;nbsp;But then the trouble with books is when do we have the time to read them? &amp;nbsp;Mostly we need them assigned, or want to have them read for upcoming discussions. &amp;nbsp;Having some common currency, some concepts in common, is what culture is all about, popular culture but also high culture if we care to make the distinction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As I was explaining to readers &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Wittrs/message/7188&quot;&gt;on Sean&#39;s list&lt;/a&gt;, in my case it helps to have Alex to report back to. &amp;nbsp;He has really done his homework pretty well, is someone I have no trouble looking up to when it comes to sharing views, yet he&#39;s currently too invested in various self disciplines to have the time to just sit around reading philosophy books, appealing as that may be. &amp;nbsp;I don&#39;t have oodles of time either, but as the books are right here in the Blue House, it&#39;s a lot easier for me than it is for him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More specifically, both philosophers emphasize that understanding the parts involves having a sense of the whole, and there&#39;s a changing sense of the wholeness that has profoundly existential dimensions. &amp;nbsp;One may speak of a waxing and waning that colors one&#39;s whole world, making it more or less nauseating, or enchanting, or what have you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, both philosophers develop their meanings operationally, meaning through use in context within invented language games and namespaces, with an emphasis on non-linear readings anticipatory of today&#39;s &quot;hypertext&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both philosophers tended to number their paragraphs and write aphoristically, knowing their remarks made sense in many different orders, in what could be called networks. &amp;nbsp;A sense of nodes and edges pervade the reading, ergo a sense of their topology, identified by Fuller with &quot;systems&quot; (as in &quot;systematic thinking&quot;) with a tetrahedron of six edges and four nodes serving as his &quot;minimum system&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fuller developed intelligible meanings for &quot;brain&quot; and &quot;mind&quot;, not wasting them as mere synonyms. &amp;nbsp;He kept a dramatic tension going between them. &amp;nbsp;The former might &quot;disconnect&quot; from the latter, resulting in what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theabsolute.net/ottow/&quot;&gt;Otto Weininger&lt;/a&gt; might have called &quot;a criminal state of mind in a dog-eat-dog world&quot; (a despairing hell of nail biting terror, shall we say). &amp;nbsp;Reconnecting with one&#39;s higher self, or, if connected, staying connected, was the heroic responsibility of a philosopher, or the routine responsibility of a cosmic janitor, depending on one&#39;s perspective. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In either case, a life of the mind was preferable, and Wittgenstein seriously agreed with this judgment. &amp;nbsp;Salvation / liberation was sought through some eternal eye of the needle. &amp;nbsp;Logic or grammar, rightly exercised, might help pinpoint it, but you would have to go through it on your own (an act of will, a doing more than a seeing). &amp;nbsp;The doors to new perceptions keep opening. &amp;nbsp;The act of eternally passing through them leads away from dead ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been inspired to get the Blue House added to some circuit of academic value to people, like a school of some kind. &amp;nbsp;Calling it the Global U is rather vague, while in the meantime I&#39;ve been dissing some of the better known name brands, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/more-technoinvective.html&quot;&gt;being polemical&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;My Global Data Corporation, designed from the ground up to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/&quot;&gt;Grunch-like&lt;/a&gt;, was similarly difficult to instantiate, though as a campus facility, I&#39;d say the Blue House has done a fine job of it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The only real company I sometimes work in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/equinox-retreat.html&quot;&gt;is Unilever&lt;/a&gt;, in connection with the Pauling House Campus, and CBS, in my thoughts about television, along with Python.TV and some other stuff (including Disney). &amp;nbsp;How does any of this jibe with Rad Math and Martian Math, ostensible products of said residential zone establishment? &amp;nbsp;That would be the Oregon Curriculum Network and my &quot;mechanized logic division&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/06/back-office.html&quot;&gt;through work&lt;/a&gt;, and also through Saturday Academy (an occasional gig). &amp;nbsp;Various Internet groups. Conferences. Nothing especially new. &amp;nbsp;Same old same old.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3445258864017946288'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3445258864017946288'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/01/dots-of-light.html' title='Dots of Light'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-4565146882146296652</id><published>2012-01-15T22:24:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-15T22:24:41.081-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Winter Adventure</title><content type='html'>I traveled northward alone this time, an away team of one.&amp;nbsp; My destination:&amp;nbsp; a memorial service for Eve Talmadge, my dear relative, by way of an old haunt, a place to park, sleep, unwind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the chatter after the service revolved around Cantwell, near where Lee works in Alaska.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;d been some kind of propane buildup in the Chevron station and the place had blown.&amp;nbsp; Investigators and insurance people would need to figure out what happened in order to help with the medical expenses of the injured.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no concept of no fault medical coverage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Evelyn&#39;s parents ran Mercer Island&#39;s first gas station along its first paved road, connecting a ferry on the Seattle side to a bridge on the Bellevue side.&amp;nbsp; Hap, her dad, was killed in a car accident, as was my dad.&amp;nbsp; She became a nurse and continued to nurture her talents for music and painting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Evelyn raised her family in Ohio with her first husband, who became a professor at Kent State.&amp;nbsp; Later in life, she met John Talmadge.&amp;nbsp; She and John were very connected to the life and times of Bellingham, Washington, were this service took place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tara stayed behind with the three women and the dog, working on college essays.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snow played a role in my adventures.&amp;nbsp; I saw quite a few accidents, though none seemed really serious.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Some churches may give the impression of these masterful &quot;life fixers&quot; within the core, who will take new recruits under their wing, show them the ropes, and set them on a new path.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s a nice projection, but with Friends it&#39;s really in meditation (as some might call it), in worship (also called &quot;expectant waiting&quot;) that answers well up in a form unique to the individual, comprehensible yet private.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#39;t expect it (the answers to your prayers) to come as direct advice from some &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/07/this-ones-for-you.html&quot;&gt;advanced Quakers&lt;/a&gt;&quot; who are &quot;clear&quot; (that&#39;s more the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/interest-group.html&quot;&gt;Scientologist model&lt;/a&gt; maybe).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seek wisdom from within the community, certainly, but don&#39;t imagine there&#39;s a fix-it-all core clique of Bodhisattvas -- or go ahead and imagine it (some projections are healthy), but then make sure you include yourself as &quot;one of them&quot;, as inner circle, so you don&#39;t make a pest of yourself trying to &quot;break in&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some young folks just stopped by in a car and grabbed some of the free pile stuff Lindsey set out this morning. The girl was happy to get some shoes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ll be missing the memorial service for Ardelle Dennis tomorrow, as I&#39;m planning to be on my way to another service for my Aunt Eve, daughter of my grandmother Esther&#39;s sister Elsie, sister to Bill, Howard, Bo and Ed.&amp;nbsp; These are the Swedes on my dad&#39;s side of the family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You won&#39;t find all Quakers using the word &quot;meditation&quot; for their practice, but there&#39;s enough of a bridge literature to provide that Asian-sounding spin in translations.&amp;nbsp; That some local yokels would hit upon such a style in the tumultuous 1600s is all the more amazing, and that a branch would follow one Penn to a so-called New World (or New Atlantis if Baconian), had a big downstream effect on the future of the new nation later established (in 1776 by convention).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ardelle and her family were contemporaneous with mine in the early days of Multnomah Meeting.&amp;nbsp; Hazel Hemphill was among us.&amp;nbsp; Sonya Pinney and Bob Smith remember those days.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then our family moved to Rome where my dad had found work as an urban and regional planner for the fledgling North African state of Libya.&amp;nbsp; He later worked as a planner for the Philippines, Egypt, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Lesotho, although sometimes more on the education planning side, a more specific focus.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t return to Portland until my late twenties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Multnomah Friend David Lansky was working for Ecumenical Ministries at the time, and helped me get on board with the Center for Urban Education, where I started my career as a teacher of computer-related subjects, a career that continues to this day.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8853196238187321580'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8853196238187321580'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/01/thoughts-about-meeting.html' title='Thoughts About Meeting'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-760754194679168873</id><published>2012-01-09T00:01:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-09T00:03:11.510-08:00</updated><title type='text'>More Ethnography</title><content type='html'>I&#39;ve been diving into this&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Wittgenstein Reads Weininger&lt;/i&gt; tome, by Stern and Szabados, an anthology.&amp;nbsp; Alex found it and graciously let me dig in.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s more into meditating these days, takes these things in chapters.&amp;nbsp; I understand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Movie Night at the Blue House (private party format) featured the season premier of &lt;i&gt;Portlandia&lt;/i&gt;, and the great movie &lt;i&gt;Being There&lt;/i&gt; with Peter Sellers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lindsey wasn&#39;t sure how to take the &quot;pickle anything&quot; joke, as she does take that attitude, felt targeted.&amp;nbsp; Portlanders are generally cheered by this show though.&amp;nbsp; Spoofs not bombs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Alexia, Alexia&#39;s David, Tara and I met at &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/03/back-wired.html&quot;&gt;Than Thao&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; for Thai food at our favorite Thai-Vietnamese eatery. &amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Fujin&lt;/i&gt; is our favorite Chinese and as neighbors we appreciate these families for the hard work that they do for us, day in and day out. &amp;nbsp;The cuisine was excellent as usual, with two of the dishes customized per customer requests.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The home crew was cooking up a storm when I left, with Lindsey on her drum machine. &amp;nbsp;There&#39;s been a bumper sticker in the neighborhood urging the rehumanization of music (&quot;drum machines have no soul&quot; it says), but I don&#39;t see it as either / or. &amp;nbsp;My basement is suitable for drum machine rehearsals, a lot of which are done on headphone. &amp;nbsp;Plus having a driving beat track already laid is what gives the keyboard track rails to run on, with the voice a more epiphenomenal track and last to be recorded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I outlined a number of policy goals for the near future on PHYSLRNR, which may have &lt;a href=&quot;http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=physlrnr-list&quot;&gt;a public archive&lt;/a&gt;, not sure. &amp;nbsp;I joined that list on invitation of Bob Fuller. &amp;nbsp;I tend to focus my energy there in bursts, mostly lurking. &amp;nbsp;A &quot;policy goal&quot; is of generic significance in this namespace and might mean some ground rule about the house and grounds, or a planned scenario of wider scope. &amp;nbsp;My involvement in encouraging more inter-mingling in the context of performing useful social services is hardly new. &amp;nbsp;LAAP had a lot of that (that was our &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/12/afsc-banter.html&quot;&gt;AFSC&lt;/a&gt; Latin America Asia-Pacific program, of which I was clerk for many years).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The various neighborhood households continue to weave a pattern with ours. &amp;nbsp;I only found out recently that the Lotts were helping take care of the cat, which has been turned loose to roam freely. &amp;nbsp;She&#39;s thrived so far, and has an entrance through the foundation to the music studio, still a base, though she&#39;s not really well trained enough for such an environment (somewhat feral and uncivilized -- this isn&#39;t Moon, who died some years ago).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m supposed to start filing financial aid papers for colleges soon. &amp;nbsp;I was basically low ebb for two years, with the small business retired from much local contracting as I sought to honor bank obligations. &amp;nbsp;Carol paid the &#39;rent&#39; in exchange for living here part time, a very generous contribution. &amp;nbsp;Walker donated the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/10/subgenius-devival.html&quot;&gt;maxi taxi&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;We lived out of dumpsters, figuratively speaking (OK, sometimes figuratively -- lots gets wasted in America) and depended on &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/07/fnb-urban-studies.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to keep us afloat. &amp;nbsp;Those days are not over, even though I&#39;m now getting regular electronic deposits from Sebastopol (see online c.v. for more details).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/PhiloBiz&quot;&gt;CSN work&lt;/a&gt; is voluntary for all of us, which is in the nature of start-ups, plus this is an open source / transparent endeavor and so follows a different emergence pattern.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On my radar are Bob Fuller (in recovery) and his family, and Suzanne (also friends with Alex) who lost her uncle. &amp;nbsp;Our family lost Eve Lightfoot recently, the daughter of Elsie, my grandma Esther&#39;s sister and the mother of my cousins Alice and Mary. &amp;nbsp;In the Meeting, we lost Simeon Hyde, a stalwart supporter and leader within our Multnomah Friends. &amp;nbsp;We also remembered Bill Sheppard and George Hammond recently, wanderers and treasured persons among us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At lunch today, I brought some pictures from our Parliament of World Religions trip in 1999 around this time of year. &amp;nbsp;We celebrated New Year&#39;s in Maseru, Lesotho. &amp;nbsp;Dawn did a workshop with the Dalai Lama in Durban. &amp;nbsp;He later joined the conference to deliver a keynote. &amp;nbsp;His Holiness also met with a bunch of us in the Cape Town parliament building, and was introduced by Deputy Defense Minister Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, a Friend and our host at the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shared some good New Year&#39;s Eve time with another alum from the International School. &amp;nbsp;Ms. Tomasi (as she was then known) was not in my class and had been in the Philippines much longer when I got there in 1971. &amp;nbsp;She and I knew many people in common nonetheless. &amp;nbsp;Thanks to FaceBook, we were able to make time in our lives to visit&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Back Stage&lt;/i&gt; at &lt;i&gt;The Bagdad&lt;/i&gt; and catch up and compare notes. &amp;nbsp;Expats from overseas school backgrounds should get together more. &amp;nbsp;We help the world stay a little less crazy in my view (and each other), not unlike &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/03/wanderers-2010316.html&quot;&gt;the Parliament of World Religions&lt;/a&gt;, yet even more eclectic.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1212232422067157568'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1212232422067157568'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-years-day.html' title='New Year&#39;s Day'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1762932055029310143</id><published>2011-12-26T16:22:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2022-01-09T12:56:47.198-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hanukkah / Xmas / Saternalia / Solstice</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m serious about Saternalia, thinking of &quot;that of God&quot; (Quakerese) 
in Roman culture, from the vantage point of Mt. Tabor and the aqueducts 
leading into it.&amp;nbsp; The architecture looks old English, but echoes still 
older.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some District of Columbia wants us to cover them
 over, like with domes. Like Alaskans and Californians, Oregonians don&#39;t
 always follow orders from this non-state calling itself a &quot;district&quot;.&amp;nbsp; 
Cascadia has its own forms of nationalism / bioregionalism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
 Hanukkah party featured little hand crotcheted hats by Alexia&#39;s David.&amp;nbsp; We 
discussed various medical conditions and treatments, affecting old and 
young among us (each a different case).&amp;nbsp; Conversation roamed into 
comedy, that of Louis CK and others.&amp;nbsp; We exchanged gifts and ate latkas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Xmas itself was a low key affair featuring immersion of the household, especially Tara and I, into living room movie watching:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gattaca&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/12/alice-in-wonderland-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Disney&#39;s newest), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Primer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (twice:&amp;nbsp; once with director commentary), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0427309/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Debaters&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477078/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rocket Science&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn
 came by Xmas morning and shared the rest of the cinnamon french toast.&amp;nbsp;
 He gave me a set of DIY books for home maintenance.&amp;nbsp; Nothing about 
building a TV studio per se, but an overlapping skill set for sure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jen and Melody departed south and north respectively, to rendezvous with their families.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At intermission, I downloaded &lt;i&gt;Stellarium&lt;/i&gt;
 to the laptop and projected the night sky to the south.&amp;nbsp; Tara and I 
then stood on our south-facing porch and identified Rigel, Sirius, 
Betelgeuse, Procyon using short term memory. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For dinner, Tara and I adjourned to the very busy &lt;i&gt;Fujin&lt;/i&gt;,
 one of the few restaurants serving, along with Mt. Tabor Cafe.&amp;nbsp; Earlier
 on Christmas Day we took Sarah Angel to the reservoirs and surveyed the
 city from about half way up.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d planned to hike to the top, like the
 Nallys had, but it started to rain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cousin Mary&#39;s visit before Xmas Eve was a highlight.&amp;nbsp; She regaled us with stories at the &lt;i&gt;Bagdad&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;
 She and I had Moroccan Coffees (alcoholic) while Tara got the crumble 
dessert (which all sampled).&amp;nbsp; We discussed our wide ranging family and 
friends, Tara&#39;s college process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tara couldn&#39;t make the
 Solstice Party (nor the boat ride with Barry).&amp;nbsp; Dawn used to host &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/12/more-about-christmas.html&quot;&gt;a big one&lt;/a&gt;, ever since our first 
taking up residence together on Rhine Street (not far from Aladdin 
Theater).&amp;nbsp; We&#39;d invite lots of Quakers.&amp;nbsp; As I was mentioning around 
Burma Night, Dawn would have integrated well into our &lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt; community.&amp;nbsp; The gathering at Satya&#39;s was epic, though I didn&#39;t stay long.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through
 all of this, I&#39;m putting in my hours along the Python track, making 
sure students stay busy.&amp;nbsp; They can work on ahead without me, but if I 
kick back for too long I just have that much more to catch up on.&amp;nbsp; 
Staying up all hours is a theme around here though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
 Blue House is a lot like a submarine, with someone always awake.&amp;nbsp; We 
don&#39;t &quot;burn the midnight oil&quot; so much though -- we only have the furnace
 on a few hours a week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
One can&#39;t but help feel one&#39;s cult or club member like status in a room full of people who speak the shop talk of Synergetics to some degree. &amp;nbsp;The lineage is still somewhat obscure and esoteric.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s a crystallographic flavor, which brings in the more classically trained chemists such as Steve Mastin. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had some bona fide Silicon Foresters in our midst (at least two folks from Intel).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our guest of honor was James Nystrom, a computer geek and professor, with lots of overlapping interests in physics and so on. &amp;nbsp;John Driscoll picked up on a lot of the jargon from his Systems angle. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The event was orchestrated by Sam Lanahan, with Wardwell and myself assisting with the guest list. &amp;nbsp;Having Trevor Blake, Glenn Stockton and Nick Consoletti in the maxi taxi was a privilege. &amp;nbsp;Good seeing LaJean again, as well as meeting these new people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Interesting to me was how &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/12/mystic-ball-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;the night before&lt;/a&gt; we&#39;d been looking at a picture of a younger Alex, accepting the Nobel Prize on behalf of his mom, and now tonight John was boasting (in a self-humbling not too self-serious way) about delivering a talk on the physics of consciousness from that very same famous podium / stage. &amp;nbsp;A nice segue between consecutive dinner parties, both of the highest caliber. &amp;nbsp;The projected synergy is already kicking in it seems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I found gratifying is that a gent was applying differential and integral calculus to a cuboctahedron and coming up with some interesting properties, and was also playing cellular automaton games with the tetrahedron, random walking it, per a rule set, within the IVM. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He wants to tackle A &amp;amp; B modules maybe. &amp;nbsp;He gets some of his graphics from Bob Gray.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The back story here is Sam and his 10-frequency flextegrity tetrahedron made their debut at the Rhode Island School of Design for the annual SNEC-organized Synergetics shindig, where he met this fellow Nystrom (Pearce was there too).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that Dr. Nystrom talked Jitterbug and IVM and knew differential calculus made him the ideal resource to pair up with Mark Martin, who has been sweating the details of a Flextegrity computer model based in differential equations for springs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nystrom is one of those who takes seriously Fuller&#39;s pulsating vector field concepts, as articulated by the Jitterbug sending ripple effects through the IVM. &amp;nbsp;There&#39;s a Negative Universe aspect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since he asked, whether we thought &quot;IVM&quot; or &quot;octet-truss&quot; would be best, I argued for IVM in the more theoretical context, as it makes a better dramatic foil for XYZ (also three letters). &amp;nbsp;&quot;Octet truss&quot; refers to the more times-size realized versions, the less abstract. &amp;nbsp;Bell&#39;s kites come to mind immediately, for many of us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saving the best for last in some ways: &amp;nbsp;Nystrom mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadray_coordinates&quot;&gt;using quadrays&lt;/a&gt; in one of his academic papers. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d not heard of anyone doing that besides me in &lt;i&gt;FoxPro Advisor&lt;/i&gt;, March 1999 (more an industry trade mag than an academic journal for sure). &amp;nbsp;Wow. &amp;nbsp;If there&#39;s a citation to track down here, I should do so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trevor and I played at the dinner table with BuckyBalls that he&#39;d brought (the magnetic balls, so simple). &amp;nbsp;Even though they&#39;re polarized, they&#39;ll come together in a tetrahedron.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Holiday shopping... must do some. &amp;nbsp;But work has me pinned to the laptop. &amp;nbsp;Boat ride with Barry coming up. &amp;nbsp;Wish Tara could go but she&#39;d probably be the only girl. &amp;nbsp;Nirel has the same consideration. &amp;nbsp;Sam suggested I invite Dondi to his event but I don&#39;t know her well enough, speaking of woman Wanderers I admire. &amp;nbsp;Maybe Trish and her son will join us on the boat.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/210671317851352765'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/210671317851352765'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/12/jitterbug-party.html' title='Jitterbug Party'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2436698638231842804</id><published>2011-12-17T23:00:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2011-12-17T23:33:05.671-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Lightning Talk</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

Of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/12/foray-to-washington.html&quot;&gt;the NFL&lt;/a&gt; will debate both sides of that resolution, but in the mean time, the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/11/wanderers-20111116.html&quot;&gt;aff camp&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (contending in the affirmative), with considerable resources, needn&#39;t sit on its duff.  Lets get more of those eye exam buses fielded already, backed by ophthalmologists without borders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This goes back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/virtual-opdx.html&quot;&gt;OPDX 2012&lt;/a&gt; and the planning we were doing for our Ministry of Education.  Camping gear / &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/12/more-xrl-in-bhutan.html&quot;&gt;XRL&lt;/a&gt; was expected to become yet more ephemeral (more with less).  Rather than have such a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6281428905/in/set-72157627710609369&quot;&gt;clunky dome&lt;/a&gt; in the A Camp, we might cover all of B Camp, or call it D Camp.  This didn&#39;t have to be downtown.  You may remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6300595391/&quot;&gt;planning meetings&lt;/a&gt;.  A way to occupy the indoors.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/at-ikea.html&quot;&gt;I went to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ikea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been suggesting &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7624812&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;XOM&lt;/a&gt; get involved, as a part of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/02/wanderers-201121.html&quot;&gt;new Asian focus&lt;/a&gt;.  Having a Russian Peace Corps (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/meeting-with-fcnl.html&quot;&gt;MirCorps&lt;/a&gt;) in the wings was the planning &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/city-as-campus.html&quot;&gt;around Troutdale&lt;/a&gt;.  These jets could be in Hillsboro as well, and meant for domestic / local service.  I haven&#39;t even checked where Gulfstreams are allowed to land, if we&#39;re looking to repaint more of those.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you get the exam, lenses and frames, an effort will be made to connect you in to medical records, if there&#39;s no record already.  You will likely get the usual messages about how integrating your identity across systems is a job you might help with.  Do not take only a passive interest in how your records get kept.  Activists welcome.  Designers, we need your assistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of which, the Oregon initiatives around open source record keeping in general might be a good place for &quot;I Care&quot; to start.  As an off shore NGO, we&#39;re not worried about trying to jump through hoops to become some certified HMO / PPO covered entity.  This isn&#39;t &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/industrial-scale.html&quot;&gt;business as usual&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
However, with the Chinese peacekeeper concept (like peacecorps), or the Russian MirCorps (like a geek corps), we&#39;re able to advertise some alternatives to high cost &quot;all American&quot; health care (the kind that leaves people out in the cold to die). [&lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/66624&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Like the cruise ships (some of them), the criterion for service is not &quot;ability to pay&quot;.  We expect that access to money accounts is negligible in these monopoly games, with way more losers than winners.  Doesn&#39;t mean they shouldn&#39;t have eye glasses though.  We&#39;re just not that selfish, even if that&#39;s not true about you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course realistically we might need more self serve, ways to administer one&#39;s own eye test.  Our delegation to Managua found people scrounging through boxes, trying pairs on, using trial and error against an inventory of hand-me-downs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m thinking /dreaming of a better service on average, such that we might have more pride our our species of hominid (however bloodthirsty).  Why deny a person prescription lenses in a frame (a pair of spectacles)?  Other healthcare may be more difficult to provide on such an industrial scale.  Lets make a difference where we can, when we can, while we can.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: Go Cleveland Cannibals, and all you Oregonians ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/12/judging-day.html&quot;&gt;again my distinct privilege&lt;/a&gt; to chauffeur and judge at Clackamas High School not far off I-205, Sunnyside exit.  Did I hear 46 schools were represented?  That&#39;s mind-boggling if so.  And that&#39;s what the event was, for its fearsome complexity and choreography.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Gonzo showed me right where he and Tara first met, in the hall in front of the Media Center, she the aspiring debater hoping to get a team going, and he the debate coach transferring to Cleveland High School, where she was.  She made it to nationals, which Gonzo had always been curious about.  He, she and his son Griffith went to Dallas this summer, joining other Oregonians and talent from all over the country.  Tara is 36th in something or other (not to be dismissive, I&#39;m obviously quite proud of her), in some national ranking system of the NFL (National Forensics League).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Anyway, back to yesterday:  I&#39;d judged here a year ago.  This time I got to see lots of LD debates (Lincoln Douglas), the kind Tara specialized in during her high school years.  I also judged poetry, impromptu speaking, prepared speeches.  I came away proud of these young people.  They&#39;re quite a diverse body and from all over the map (Tibet, India, Cambodia, Multnomah, Redmond... Guatemala).  Such lovely people.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Yes, I took a lot of pictures in that one math classroom, B10, where we did some poetry.  These were intense readings, lots of passion and thought.  They needed a theme, readings from at least three sources to connect the dots, some remarks in between.  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
What also impressed me as we were gathering were the professional posters the sports teams were getting.  Pretty impressive, to have posters like that.  I snarfed up the girl teams especially, not knowing when my battery might die.  I consider them more exotic, because it&#39;s not all that long ago that women didn&#39;t get the same privileges as men in sports.  I was feeling proud their posters were so humbling, if that makes any sense.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Back to the events:  Tara was quite appreciative and sportsmanlike (heh) regarding her various opponents.  Those winning this time she may have won against before and vice versa.  The best of the pack are like a club.  This is definitely a variety of para- or pre-legal training, I&#39;d say effective.  Tara is not currently planning to make &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/12/protecting-lawyers.html&quot;&gt;a study of law&lt;/a&gt; her focus (thinking more STEM), but that doesn&#39;t preclude her from getting a feel for the dynamics of Matt&#39;s world, for example (collegial, yet competitive, a willingness to fight hard for your client against people you know you&#39;ll likely have lunch with).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
These meetups are excellent demonstrations of inter-generational collaboration.  The adults really want to do their jobs well.  They&#39;re all paying it forward, serving their world, putting their shoulder to the cause of civil process, working things out by the athletics of speech and expression, theater, not massacre and mayhem.  Civilization was served, that seemed clear to everyone I thought.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The resolution for LDers this time:  individuals are morally obligated to assist people in need.  I could write a few reams on how that went down.  Maybe I will.  More of this on TV, with these same youth performing, oldsters too, would make sense to me.  Too geeky?  Hey, give us some channels to be as geeky as we wanna be.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Not to worry: just because I&#39;ve seen one semi-hagiographic DVD made by some of her best friends, am I now suddenly some authority on Objectivism or what have you.  This will not be a boring lecture decrying (or embracing) her metaphysics (if that&#39;s an appropriate word).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&quot;Awww, what a sweetheart&quot; was my more up front reaction, along with &quot;so is this what the fuss was about?&quot;  I&#39;d checked out &lt;i&gt;The Fountainhead&lt;/i&gt; in like 8th grade, noticing its push-button value in adult faces.  Like anyone that age (and younger) I wanted to be a part of the conversation, and this looked like a ticket.  But then I lost the thread, and hey, who gets to live near a &lt;i&gt;Movie Madness&lt;/i&gt; well stocked with well made documentaries? Certainly not me, until my middle years, when I had the good fortune to occupy a space in 97214 (actually, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6427671763/&quot;&gt;a few spaces&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
What I guess people don&#39;t get, quite, is how &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/back-in-ussa.html&quot;&gt;the USSR&lt;/a&gt; of the day was a convenient backdrop against which to play out big labor disputes (many still ongoing).  The reality of the Russian experience was going to take much longer to get through, given the Doppler Effect of human affairs and osmosis.  Ayn was first wave messenger from a world deep in dire straits, a hell for so many.  New York had its own Broadway version of Russia going, more romantic, more a projection.  Rather than fault that, just accept it, and read Hugh Kenner in &lt;i&gt;The Pound Era&lt;/i&gt; about the invention of China (while we&#39;re at it).  So yeah, she was out of tempo with the drama so many were on about, but hey, she&#39;d trained with the best, in Hollywood, and knew how to hold her own.  Good for her.  I admire her gumption, her complete commitment to her dreams.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
But then I&#39;m hopelessly lost in some other dimension, is the other shoe maybe.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/10/letter-to-allen-wanderers-list.html&quot;&gt;My meaning of &quot;capitalism&quot; for example&lt;/a&gt;:  I play cities against cities, like we do in sports, talking about London and Hanoi as my &quot;capitals&quot;.  These days I&#39;m severely &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/city-as-campus.html&quot;&gt;dissing WDC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/shovel-ready.html&quot;&gt;boosting Portland&lt;/a&gt;.  That&#39;s me being a capitalist, using my head in a sensible way.  Ayn Rand did the same, boosting New York, loving those skyscrapers.  Hey, go for it girl.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
We watched in my living room, Tara, Steve Holden and I all on our lap tops, doing our work.  Tara found Phil Donahue amusing and I found myself explaining about the invention of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/07/late-night-tv.html&quot;&gt;the TV talk show&lt;/a&gt; and the pioneers of the genre, Oprah in the same lineage.  Ninja David showed up on my porch during intermission asking to borrow my cell phone, sucking me back into my own &lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt; soap opera (David &quot;give me a hug...&quot; fade out, cue laugh track, see ya next week).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
The funniest part of the Ayn Rand story (at her expense, but she could laugh about it later):  she&#39;s like totally gung ho to sail into New York Harbor past the Statue of Liberty, seeing the skyline, has dreamed for this day all her life, and she sleeps through it or something (I was glancing at my laptop when they said what the problem was).  Never mind.  She had her tears of joy later.  So many of her dreams came true.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Speaking of which, the other irony or poetic twist if you prefer, was that this ardent atheist would have so many miraculous experiences, such as finding herself a handsome / dashing Roman soldier right off the set of &lt;i&gt;King of Kings&lt;/i&gt;, with Cecil B. DeMille himself taking her under his wing. &quot;You can&#39;t make this stuff up.&quot;  Which leaves open to question, &quot;so who does?&quot;  Ayn (I&#39;m guessing): &quot;you don&#39;t need a who (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/physics-emergent-isepp-lecture.html&quot;&gt;no agency&lt;/a&gt;).&quot;  God:  &quot;look ma, no hands!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
