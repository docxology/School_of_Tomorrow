One of the regulars was showing off yoga poses he&#39;d learned (crow, eagle, tree, etc.), to the possible amusement of passers-by (big windows).  I could do none of them, but felt inspired to do more aerobics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m envious of these elite few who enjoy affordable health care, careful monitoring and so on.  Our family physician, Dr. Lauren Roberts, is one of the best ever IMO (she saved my wife&#39;s life, plus helped deliver our baby), but she sees like 28 people a day.  Family practice MDs tend to be overworked, plus they don&#39;t see even half the people needing medical attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/middle-school-geography.html&quot;&gt;geography&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;d say &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.geneseo.edu/pipermail/math-thinking-l/2006-January/000949.html&quot;&gt;biomed&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/beyond-gene.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; professional walk of life to be in these days.  It has everything:  computer science, chemistry, physics, psychology, spiritual depth, opportunities for travel... A well-rounded biomed person has to-die-for job prospects.  And I&#39;m including a lot of eastern stuff, like those mom and pop martial arts storefronts, which teach kids self-discipline and self-defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m heartened to see the cop and lawyer shows making room for more doctor shows in the fantasy genre (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108757/&quot;&gt;ER&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142/&quot;&gt;House, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; and such).  Both cops and lawyers need medical science to do their jobs properly (DNA testing, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247082/&quot;&gt;CSI&lt;/a&gt;-style forensics and so on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we could find a way to combine doctor shows with a kind of high tech Peace Corps operation (with toys as fun as the military&#39;s), and make it &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/location-scouting.html&quot;&gt;reality TV&lt;/a&gt; instead of just fantasy, I bet we&#39;d get some high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grunch would have lots of opportunities for product placement, which is even better than commercials in some contexts, when it comes to inspiring &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/10/market-research.html&quot;&gt;brand loyalty&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113683044628001853'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113683044628001853'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/morning-in-america.html' title='Morning in America'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113675048160037767</id><published>2006-01-08T12:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:49.263-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Shooting Pool</title><content type='html'>Last night I joined Matt and Mike at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=52&quot;&gt;McMenamins on Savier&lt;/a&gt; (recently remodeled) to belatedly celebrate Mike&#39;s 48th birthday.

Terry drove me home so I could dig out the two tapes of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/10/wanderers-20051018.html&quot;&gt;Rick&#39;s talk&lt;/a&gt;.  Then I joined Don and Rick himself for a Thai lunch at &lt;a href=&quot;http://cuisinenet.com/info/?v=237&amp;amp;/portland/rest/7556.shtml&quot;&gt;Thanh Thao&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later brainstorming with Don helped me think through some issues with my new designer religion, a form of Quakerism (speaking of which, I saw Janet Jump sitting in her car one block north of Fremont as we headed towards the boat).  I&#39;d like to bring Eve into the foreground (speaking of whom, it was great to have Eve back at Wanderers yesterday), stop blaming her for the whole snake business.  We&#39;ll use a tetrahedron as a &quot;temple of eVe&quot; symbol, plus the snake reconnects us to Naga, ala &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312793626/qid=1136845405/102-9371474-8621747&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tetrascroll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, there&#39;s a kind of feminism implied here, drawing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.geraldgardner.com/&quot;&gt;Gerald Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0923736/&quot;&gt;Joss Whedon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starhawk.org/&quot;&gt;Starhawk&lt;/a&gt; et al, although speaking as a guy, I&#39;m treading lightly to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; wall myself out (&quot;Kirby&#39;s angels&quot;).  I&#39;m also interested in a series of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Meliptus&lt;/span&gt; commercials which make people really want to sign up for the seminar or training or whatever, but it turns out the ads (e.g. &quot;step into yourself&quot;) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;are&lt;/span&gt; the product.  There&#39;s nothing to take (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hulu.com/watch/151134&quot;&gt;an obvious allusion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, that&#39;s on the humanities side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other side of the chasm (C.P. Snow&#39;s), I&#39;ve got my new computer.org mailing address working, thanks to IEEE, and have reupped with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.geneseo.edu/mailman/listinfo/math-thinking-l&quot;&gt;math-thinking-l&lt;/a&gt;.  I&#39;ve been a busy bee already &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.geneseo.edu/pipermail/math-thinking-l/2006-January/date.html&quot;&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the way home from the boat, I stopped at a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Safeway&lt;/span&gt; to buy Soduku puzzles for Dawn, then rode the Max to Hollywood, where I side-tripped to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Trader Joe&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; for some Yemen Mocha (coffee beans I favor).  I&#39;m drinking some now, from my new &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Starbucks Barista&lt;/span&gt; (an Xmas present).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113647341973393142'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113647341973393142'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/wanderering-in-pdx.html' title='Wanderering in PDX'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113600738035527529</id><published>2005-12-30T21:27:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:49.054-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hanukkah Party</title><content type='html'>We missed the big Hanukkah Party this year, because of our booking on the mountain. I was actually triple booked: Wanderers featured Dick Pugh and his Trans-Siberian Railroad adventure (not a recent trip, but still a great story -- I got an update from Don).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this year we went to a smaller Hanukkah Party, same site, and enjoyed many of the same activities: eating latkes, playing dradle for chocolate geld, exchanging gifts, perusing the Yiddish dictionary (a simple one). We talked a lot about movies and TV shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I brought several brands of sparkling juice (grape, pear, strawberry, apple, apple-marionberry) and suggested we each hypothesize which we&#39;d like best, then see if we&#39;d guessed right. That didn&#39;t happen exactly (my agenda wasn&#39;t a big priority, nor was I especially attached to it). The grape was a big hit, and was kosher besides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Earlier, I helped Barry, a retired banker and peace corps vet (and Wanderer) snake some wires through a pipe on his 40 foot Tollycraft -- he was adding a new GPS device. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/1/06&lt;/span&gt;:  the GPS works great! Barry took her out the next day and we watched ourselves make a line on the screen (lots of floating wood, dodged a dead tree).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113600738035527529'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113600738035527529'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/hanukkah-party.html' title='Hanukkah Party'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113581359108946524</id><published>2005-12-28T15:43:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-06-22T19:49:46.139-07:00</updated><title type='text'>On the Mountain</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/giant.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/giant.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;discovered decal&lt;br /&gt;North wall, Mt.

I&#39;m still thinking about Gloria&#39;s rum cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn and I met under the big tree in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pioneercourthousesquare.org/&quot;&gt;Pioneer Courthouse Square&lt;/a&gt; for some last minute shopping. A baby carriage tipped over on the swaying trolley, dumping infant and toddler. Dawn rushed to help mother while I mumbled some apologies for the faulty engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night we did Christmas Eve with Quakers at the Stark Street meeting house.

I was happy to share this time with so many fine people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ability to sing appears to have deteriorated somewhat -- these days I mostly just listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, our family was graced with gifts from faraway places:  Italy, Lebanon, Tibet, Michigan...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted Tara to experience the joys of vinyl records, and so purchased a turntable (Denon), along with some used records (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles&quot;&gt;The Beatles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Was_The_Year_That_Was&quot;&gt;Tom Lehrer&lt;/a&gt;), plus Dawn has an old stack, plus Don was giving &#39;em away at the Wanderers party. We also got her a more modern disc player, cell phone, and a robot dog (Tara has developed an intense interest in robotics lately).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m expecting Matt to come by.

Thanks to modern electronics, we&#39;re able to make this dream real, to a degree. By embedding applets, Flash animations, movies within the text, we&#39;re in a position to offer new vehicles for content delivery within the classroom or home school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another dream is to make interaction with these books remunerative, in the sense that passing tests in safe, controlled conditions will advance your credentials along various tracks, making you eligible for new services. Remuneration needn&#39;t be in the form of cash. If you&#39;re a marine biology major, you might net an invitation to join some field expedition, ala Darwin&#39;s journey to the Galapagos. Or you might get some new gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is to make education rewarding, as well as demanding, both by enhancing the content delivery mechanisms, and by embedding new opportunities within that content. Resource allocation occurs intelligibly, in response to students&#39; needs, abilities and commitments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course this already describes the current system fairly closely. The difference is more in terms of bandwidth -- these fatter pipe books will move you along more quickly, waste less of your limited time with us here on Spaceship Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Related reading:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;On edu-sig @ Python.org: [&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2005-December/005637.html&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2005-December/005639.html&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2005-December/005641.html&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;On math-teach @ Math Forum: [&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?messageID=4154572&amp;#4154572&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?messageID=4157847&amp;amp;#4157847&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html&quot;&gt;Background re GST&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/pr.html&quot;&gt;Project Renaissance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102722/&quot;&gt;Movie allusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113510780870068325'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113510780870068325'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/prosperos-books.html' title='Prospero&#39;s Books'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113492641156545901</id><published>2005-12-18T09:11:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-06-08T21:54:12.691-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Heptagons</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/gardnersm.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/gardnersm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a masterfully done invitation to G4G7, the 7th annual Gathering for Martin Gardner, master puzzler and keeper of the mathematical archives.

Wanderers simply joined the meeting, contributing wine and cheese, and a twisted sense of humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weather, snowpack, terrain, and the human factor all play a role in setting the danger level. About 90% of fatalities get attributed to human misjudgments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware of these three modes or pitfalls:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;   &lt;li&gt;sheep mode (following blindly) &lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;horse mode (cutting corners in the rush to get home)&lt;/li&gt;   &lt;li&gt;lion mode (woo hoo, I&#39;m immortal).  &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; Operating in any of these modes might get you killed. Males in the presence of females tend to take greater risks. Don&#39;t be afraid to speak up even if you&#39;re not the leader. Leaders, give your group members frequent opportunities to check in and share about their state. Keep both laser focus and peripheral awareness (urban analogy: never cross a busy intersection talking obliviously on your cell phone, even if the light is with you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The avalanche-aware know how to read a site for signs, plus bring to bear their knowledge of recent history. Releases are triggered by shifting weight, not loud sounds. If the snow is layered, with a top layer only weakly bonded to the one beneath it, and if the slope is moderately steep (quasi-vertical isn&#39;t usually a problem), look out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If caught in a release, plant your poles, shed gear, yell loudly to help others mark your position (you&#39;ll likely be downhill from where they last saw you). They&#39;ll need to find you soon. Warm breath within the snow pocket, usually 4-6 feet under, seals it with ice and reduces the oxygen flow. Your chance of survival drops by 50% after about 30 minutes. Carry a beacon. Carry a collapsable pole to search for your friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found the speaker highly engaging and effective. This was the kind of presentation Wanderers would do well to emulate (he had slides, handouts, quotes, quips, actual gear). He was also on the older side, which was reassuring (the guy must be doing something right, given how many hours he&#39;s spent on the slopes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry and I ducked out a couple times to continue our &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/12/design-science.html&quot;&gt;meeting of earlier today&lt;/a&gt;. We&#39;re city rats, less likely to be leading clueless newbies through snowy mountain mazes. However, I did pick up a wallet card for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nwac.us/&quot;&gt;Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center&lt;/a&gt;, just in case.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113458242536881201'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113458242536881201'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/avalanche-awareness.html' title='Avalanche Awareness'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113424888188979225</id><published>2005-12-10T13:06:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2008-12-11T15:28:10.734-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Saying Cheese</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/cheese.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/cheese.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&quot;allusion to Wallace &amp;amp; Gromit&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(photo by Tara Urner, Olympus Stylus 500)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113424888188979225'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113424888188979225'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/saying-cheese.html' title='Saying Cheese'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113424874138196872</id><published>2005-12-10T13:03:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-12-08T00:32:13.630-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Sixth Grade Science</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/popcorn.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/popcorn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tara&#39;s Popcorn Experiment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Winterhaven, Dec 8, 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113424874138196872'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113424874138196872'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/sixth-grade-science.html' title='Sixth Grade Science'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113420112842318374</id><published>2005-12-09T22:49:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:48.227-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Harry Potter, GOF (movie review)</title><content type='html'>Yes, they&#39;re growing up, expressing more teenage characteristics, but one thing Harry and friends don&#39;t seem to do is question authority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The administration summons Harry&#39;s best friends off camera, then ties them to the bottom of a lake.

I consumed Laszlo&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594770425/qid=1134093312/&quot;&gt;new book&lt;/a&gt; about some A-field, Ervin having been in charge of this Budapest Institute, some think tank Dr. Consoletti attended in his process of earning a PhD certification.

Those in the third category were considered to &quot;have made it&quot;, those in the second to be &quot;just making it&quot; or maybe &quot;doing OK&quot;, and those in the first &quot;not making it&quot;. What all this jargon meant, in practice, is something an historian could tell you.

Last time, she restarted, this time no dice. So we arranged another car to fetch the kids and I waited for AAA, reading &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ideas&lt;/span&gt; by Peter Watson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The USA Towing guy showed up in the requested Battery Support Unit (AAA roadside service and I agreed that&#39;s what I needed -- not a tow truck). He tested the battery, and &#39;shore nuff it was close to dead (14% rating). I cheerfully agreed to buy a new one off him, but according to his clipboard log, he&#39;d just transacted his last compatible unit away. So although he jump started my car, he entered an NSR (no service rendered) into the AAA computer -- because he didn&#39;t have the battery I wanted to buy. He suggested &lt;a style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.lesschwab.com/&quot;&gt;Les Schwab&lt;/a&gt; (14% is low enough to suggest immediate replacement).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I drove her to the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Les Schwab&lt;/span&gt; on SE Powell and received instant expert service. They offered me a choice between extremely powerful and super extremely powerful batteries. I went for the less expensive choice, which it turned out was not in stock, so they gave me the super duper one for the price of the only super one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AAA entered an NSR for me once before on this car, when I got her towed on a flat bed, following the bicycle collision with Matt. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/blog/2004/Jul/13#car2&quot;&gt;That time&lt;/a&gt;, my driver was also the evening&#39;s chief, and needed to rush to a crash scene, Razz already strapped down in the back (me front). He kindly credited back the service because I didn&#39;t raise any fuss maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wanderers met this morning.  Then I adjourned to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wired&lt;/span&gt;, and later to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Meliptus&lt;/span&gt; (lunch at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Thanh Thao&lt;/span&gt;).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113401277204626806'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113401277204626806'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/another-nsr-from-aaa.html' title='Another NSR from AAA'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113372378880118246</id><published>2005-12-04T11:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:48.022-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (movie review)</title><content type='html'>A playful romp through modern Gotham, wherein fathers rape, imprison and/or kill their own daughters -- or simply steal, write trashy fiction, and make movies. The loser anti-hero, a thief, bad in bed and at math, pursues the slinky, funny girl of his boyhood dreams. She cuts him some slack, thinking he&#39;s really a detective who might help solve a loved one&#39;s murder. He pulls off some magic and saves the day. Heart warming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt and I retired to Leaky Roof (new owners) for some dinner, where I discovered I&#39;d lost my free movie ticket (I&#39;m a card carrying Regal Cinemas goer).

The answer is Biblical I suppose: just one or two worth saving is enough to tip the scales. But I get tired of the Bible too.

I&#39;m using Mary&#39;s iMac and missing those Blogger interface controls in Safari. Tara is on the treadmill behind me, watching the first &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Smallville&lt;/span&gt; episode with headphones on big plasma. Dawn is in the kitchen, teaching Mary about Buddhism&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Four Noble Truths&lt;/span&gt;. Mary is an ER physician, and is the daughter of my grandmother Esther&#39;s sister Elsie&#39;s daughter Eve. We&#39;ll be taking off here shortly. The plan is to head for that Paul Allen &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_Music_Project&quot;&gt;rock and roll museum&lt;/a&gt; at Seattle Center, near the Space Needle. I expect it&#39;ll be crowded. None of us has ever been before. I uploaded my Thanksgiving pix via USB to iPhoto.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent much of the morning browsing Norm Stamper&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560256931/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Breaking Rank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his autobiographical insider analysis of policing in turn-of-the-century &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/making-coffee.html&quot;&gt;Gotham&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. Seattle, San Diego). He gives the unions some heat for shielding incompetence. If our society had a stronger homeschooling and community college safety net, i.e. if job loss weren&#39;t such a threat to basic survival, then it&#39;d be easier to let go of those most in need of a new profession (many politicians included). A lot of people end up in jobs for which they&#39;re ill suited, and society pays a high price for that. I expect it&#39;d be worth the collective costs to purge ranks in many walks of life -- think of it as a vast student exchange program. Unions would be more like professional guilds of old, upholding high standards and keeping their reputations for excellence well deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Later the same day:&lt;/span&gt; At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Experience_Music_Project.html&quot;&gt;EMP&lt;/a&gt;, I learned Jimi Hendrix attended the same high school as Mom (Garfield High in Seattle). The SciFi museum was pretty good, especially if you&#39;re able to read English, but even if not. I&#39;m home after driving about 600 miles since Tuesday. We reunited with our pets, I unpacked and installed the new Qwest modem for faster DSL. Dawn and Tara, inspired by the museum, are watching &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Star Wars V&lt;/span&gt;. Catching up on snailmail, email (over 3.4K spams) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2005-11/26/content_3837071.htm&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113294148169659181'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113294148169659181'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/post-thanksgiving.html' title='Post Thanksgiving'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-113280706751345608</id><published>2005-11-23T20:24:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:47.670-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Posting via Modem</title><content type='html'>So we&#39;re in our favorite hotel in Bellingham, WA, the one with the spooky aviators hanging from the ceiling, over the indoor pool. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We met a dad in the jacuzzi, a local.  His house had caught fire a couple days ago.  Insurance services showed up to collect their clothing (for cleaning), and possessions (for storing), plus picked up the tab for some time in a hotel.  His family was enjoying the facilities. The house was to be repaired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over dinner at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbaybrewery.com/theBeer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Boundary Bay Brewery and Bistro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we discussed Buddhist precepts, Dawn&#39;s cancer treatment, tragic deaths, pain, suffering, enlightenment. I&#39;d just learned about Douglas Hofstadter&#39;s suffering, from the preface of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fluid Concepts and Creative Analogies&lt;/span&gt; (my reading of late). His story reminded me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1557042233/&quot;&gt;William Wharton&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;, and of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1570627428/&quot;&gt;Ken Wilber&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara remarked how kind it would be if death were not so hard, as in &quot;see you in a next life sometime.&quot; I remarked that if I died tomorrow (not my plan of course), no one should get too bent out of shape over it.

Aside from the jam up around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ci.lynnwood.wa.us/Content/HomePage.aspx?id=1&quot;&gt;Lynnwood WA&lt;/a&gt;, the driving was pleasant enough. We retrieved Dawn from her retreat center (a five day, no talking, meditation around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ethnicityonline.net/buddhism_glossary.htm#m&quot;&gt;metta&lt;/a&gt;), and continued on through Seattle in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/hov/&quot;&gt;HOV lane&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/regions/northwest/traffic/expresslanes/&quot;&gt;express lanes&lt;/a&gt; also saved time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I helped Tara stuff an MP3 player with some favorite tunes before we left, plus she had a hand-drawn coloring book from Micheal Sunanda (in Costa Rica these days) but once we slowed to around 15-20 mph she got bored and started categorizing trucks by wheel count (most had 6 or 18, a few had 22, one had 34).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, Les showed me some pix of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/city.html?n=649&quot;&gt;Tsingdao, China&lt;/a&gt;, from whence he&#39;d recently returned. I encouraged him to upload a short clip of a local traffic pattern: a bus turns onto a four lane &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/thoroughfare&amp;r=67&quot;&gt;thoroughfare&lt;/a&gt; and simply chooses the nearest lane -- against oncoming traffic! Tsingdao has seen an explosion in vehicular traffic in the past few years (several doublings) and many of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmv.org/&quot;&gt;new drivers&lt;/a&gt; learned their skills second or third hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another story: back when command economists were at their apex in China, wooden fishing boats were banned, the theory being that upgrading to metal hulls would force modernization. However, the traditional craft were built to last and now, a half-century later, a few have come out of retirement, long after the upstart metal ones have turned to rust.
