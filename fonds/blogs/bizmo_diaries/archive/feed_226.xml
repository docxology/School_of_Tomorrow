This morning I was able to do outdoor chores even in late morning, mowing, weeding and the like.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live without air conditioning, although it&#39;s been offered.  Power fans do the job.  I&#39;m still using oil heat in the winter as this house came with a muscular model and we&#39;re not hooked up to municipal gas lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I shared about Allegra&#39;s passing with her friends and admirers on Curt McNamara&#39;s Trim Tab Book Club listserv.  &quot;Call me Trim Tab&quot; it says on her dad&#39;s gravestone, a fitting epitaph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat outside in the backyard with Glenn, as twilight spread, reminiscing about my several encounters with Allegra and her family over the decades.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky to be a contemporary, with a partially overlapping scenario.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D.W. Jacobs writes today on Facebook:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Today, is Bucky Fuller&#39;s birthday. Bucky was born July 12, 1895. Yesterday morning, his daughter, Allegra, passed away. I met her in early July, 1995, in San Diego at the Centennial celebration of Bucky&#39;s birthday. She was a major force in the world of dance. She danced in Balanchine&#39;s company, but then moved into dance ethnology. She was Chair of the UCLA dance department for 25 years, where she founded the Center for World Arts and Culture. 💖She was the best of friends and a mentor and guide for so many people all over the world. &lt;a href=&quot;http://allegrafullersnyder.com/&quot;&gt;http://allegrafullersnyder.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Four CCP balls define our D-for-diameter-edged tetrahedron of volume one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to calculate the random walks, we use Quadrays as syntactic sugar.&amp;nbsp; The IVM ball packing is their sweet spot, which is why they&#39;re &quot;IVM coordinates&quot; by some accounts (including mine), in contrast to XYZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to calculate the sixth edge lengths, we simply perform vector subtraction between adjacent corners. Quadrays have essentially the same vector algebra as XYZ when it comes to adding, subtracting, and scaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to calculate the tetrahedron&#39;s volume, we use Gerald de Jong&#39;s formula, even though he has lost his derivation.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no denying it works well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six edge lengths go in, fanning out from any apex and circuiting the opposite base, and the tetravolume comes out, natively, with no need for a modifying constant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corresponding XYZ volume is computed accordingly, as IVM volume times 1/S3 (S3 being the Synergetics Constant for converting volumes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, we needed to learn what the IVM was, and to visualize movement within it as a process of hopping in one of twelve directions, by distance D, at each turn to play.&amp;nbsp; Then we needed to absorb the concept of tetravolumes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting whole number tetravolumes for the tetrahedra helps shock us into a mindset that might be open to the concentric hierarchy, wherein those rhombic dodecahedral cells around each sphere, each have a volume of six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the above, along with figurate and polyhedral numbers more generally, including kissing point counts, form our IVM-XYZ bridge over troubled waters, the C.P. Snow chasm.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2129817464140994971'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2129817464140994971'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/07/canonical-lesson-plan.html' title='Canonical Lesson Plan'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-738588745984452160</id><published>2021-06-14T11:30:00.006-07:00</published><updated>2021-06-14T11:31:54.048-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Heuristics for Teachers (continued)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/OMMdm4j3KZM&quot; style=&quot;background-image: url(https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OMMdm4j3KZM/hqdefault.jpg);&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The tagging of the complex biological process under the single title rose tends to detour human curiosity from further differentiation of its integral organic operations as well as from consideration of its interecological functionings aboard our planet. We don&#39;t know what a rose is, nor what may be its essential and unique cosmic function. Thus for long have we inadvertently deferred potential discovery of the essential roles in Universe that are performed complementarily by many, if not most, of the phenomena we experience. But, goaded by youth, we older ones are now taking second looks at almost everything. And that promises many ultimately favorable surprises. The oldsters do have vast experience banks not available to the youth. Their memory banks, integrated and reviewed, may readily disclose generalized principles of eminent importance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Exercise:&amp;nbsp; mine for memories of meanings for &quot;rose&quot; and be favorably surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7018432245529917447'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7018432245529917447'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/06/city-of-roses.html' title='City of Roses'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3400946838722787192</id><published>2021-05-20T11:11:00.006-07:00</published><updated>2021-05-20T11:11:51.518-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Mapping Out a Curriculum</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/m660f58qo2M&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thinking with Mike Episode 5:&amp;nbsp; My Favorite Martian Mathematician&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3400946838722787192'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3400946838722787192'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/05/mapping-out-curriculum.html' title='Mapping Out a Curriculum'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/m660f58qo2M/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1247280502752336002</id><published>2021-04-24T09:41:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2021-04-24T09:41:10.363-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Synergetics in the Humanities</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Excerpt from recent correspondence (email to Maurice, Apr 20, 2021, 3:02 AM ), regarding Kenneth Snelson&#39;s relationship with Bucky Fuller:&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;He was always trying to figure out where the narrative was going to go around Bucky.&amp;nbsp; Was the guy a genius or a crackpot and to what extent would tensegrity be tarnished or polished by the association?&amp;nbsp; Had he been victimized somehow, was the core question, e.g. by a mad man with a messiah complex?&amp;nbsp; A lot hinged on what a next generation did with the whole corpus.&amp;nbsp; He was still trying to see the future.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s why he reached out to me, an early&amp;nbsp;web guy focusing on Bucky stuff, both to warn me about what he called the Church of Bucky, and to get a sense of where said &quot;church&quot; might be going in future, as that would inevitably be impacting the Snelson story and reputation as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t think his question was ever fully answered, and that had been the problem all along:&amp;nbsp; an inability to reach consensus on the nature and/or level of Bucky&#39;s game.&amp;nbsp; He somewhat resented the sense that, as a Black Mountain College student, he&#39;d been left to figure that all out for himself.&amp;nbsp; Bucky was looking at Snelson as a possible protege, and given how mission-critical the former thought his own work might be, that put Kenneth under a lot of pressure.&amp;nbsp; He just wanted to enjoy being a college kid and having a girlfriend.&amp;nbsp; That he was put in the position of needing to assess Bucky was in some ways infuriating.&amp;nbsp; Others should be helping more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;To make a long story short, he eventually fell in with a crowd who assured him Bucky was pretty much a charlatan and he&#39;d be doing us a service by fighting him directly and publicizing their&amp;nbsp;tug-o-war over intellectual property (both were patenting).&amp;nbsp; Kenneth thought they had something like a truce, an understanding:&amp;nbsp; Bucky would stay out of the art world and leave &quot;tensegrity as art&quot; to Kenneth, as what could a design science guy need with pure art?&amp;nbsp; Then it appeared Bucky transgressed that line, and was moving into the art world himself, and that&#39;s when Kenneth put on his battle armor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #222222; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;But then people such as myself gave him pause.

I don&#39;t claim that wrinkle came in with the Python.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given Python&#39;s &quot;duck typing&quot; it&#39;s easy enough to use the same source code to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://qr.ae/pGTO3C&quot;&gt;arbitrary precision inputs&lt;/a&gt; (way beyond floating points in precision) and to use such as the plane nets for A, B, T, E, S modules in Synergetics to get these volumes and to interconvert their expression with &lt;a href=&quot;https://replit.com/@kurner/SandE-Modules#main.py&quot;&gt;Koski&#39;s versions&lt;/a&gt;, involving Phi (Fuller avoided using both Phi and Pi in his invented language of Synergetics, whereas adding Phi back in simplifies a lot of the dimensions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve also been frequenting a certain Wayne Roberts &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.principlesofnature.com/number_geometry_connections/areas_of_a_new_class_of_triangle_the_eutrigon_in_etu.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Principles of Nature&lt;/i&gt; website&lt;/a&gt; wherein he proves how the area of what he calls a &quot;eutrigon&quot; (one or three angles set to 60 degrees) is A x B where A, B are the lengths including the 60 degree angle, and C is the opposite edge connecting A to B. Multiplication is a matter of specifying the two sides and &quot;closing the lid&quot; (adding C). Lengths 4, 3 would give area of 12 etc.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHPxpfHtBqt7ivhr13kMl2qEZcw5-m2K2lfOYXE_MLv0Ec0lWTmo5H7DWFrYFg1-nLYrztsCMZWn49zrp7ooMI_FLISRqgoCqv6bwBjNystGq-1uWk6RGj0XvQO1uA2KhmZD4A/s531/39851434711_c4a65f780b_o.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;515&quot; data-original-width=&quot;531&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHPxpfHtBqt7ivhr13kMl2qEZcw5-m2K2lfOYXE_MLv0Ec0lWTmo5H7DWFrYFg1-nLYrztsCMZWn49zrp7ooMI_FLISRqgoCqv6bwBjNystGq-1uWk6RGj0XvQO1uA2KhmZD4A/s320/39851434711_c4a65f780b_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;area in ETUs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Using the same volume formula and treating the unit tetrahedron as analogous to Wayne&#39;s &quot;ETU&quot; (equilateral triangular unit), I show the model is entirely analogous i.e. lengths A, B, C from a common corner (picture XYZ corner as analog) give A x B x C as the corresponding volume, once again with a &quot;closing the lid&quot; operation, this time on a tetrahedron vs. a triangle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO1VmKpNWbnDUUZX6-ShARm-uF4XZGhgoyDSXXH1iFuxhCHhAMjaX5izkSKIkLNslVGLdd3rOlY7wN9AxMO0FN3TfsoCwFt2cpqdH18R4qMQ1d9kKvbDjx8raQUmqmR3rmpZ3S/s1512/martian_mult2.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;942&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1512&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjO1VmKpNWbnDUUZX6-ShARm-uF4XZGhgoyDSXXH1iFuxhCHhAMjaX5izkSKIkLNslVGLdd3rOlY7wN9AxMO0FN3TfsoCwFt2cpqdH18R4qMQ1d9kKvbDjx8raQUmqmR3rmpZ3S/s320/martian_mult2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;2 x 2 x 5 = 20&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Given the fixed angle of the ABC corner (that of a regular tet), the remaining three lengths are already determined and easy to obtain, for the purpose of feeding into the 6-edge-eating formula above.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I personally don&#39;t need a whole worked out math textbook with proofs + index in order &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2021/03/more-wikipedia-talk-on-facebook.html&quot;&gt;to encourage&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;developing coding skills while imagining a reference &quot;sculpture&quot; namely the concentric hierarchy from Synergetics.

&lt;p&gt;Tuesday this week was a mini day of reckoning.&amp;nbsp; Would the new appliance show up as the email promised, and work?&amp;nbsp; This may be the biggest appliance I&#39;ve bought on the web, sight unseen (but for pictures).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about the furnace? Letting an oil furnace run out of fuel (my bad) puts air or worse in the line, making a restart difficult sometimes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One ends up phoning a technician. The technician usually does a hard sell on rebuilding the whole furnace. Should I convert the house to gas?&amp;nbsp; Not an option at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Samsung dishwasher appears up to the task. The guys who put it in clearly have their choreography down. Efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The furnace wouldn&#39;t come on at first.&amp;nbsp; The fuel line from under the driveway is quite long. I kept at it, pressing the red button at long intervals, and finally, ignition.&amp;nbsp; The line was cleared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m back to keeping the household running smoothly, for a 62 and almost 92 year old, during a pandemic. Many thanks to my friends who help out in so many ways.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5545474099672882531'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5545474099672882531'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/03/domestic-logistics.html' title='Domestic Logistics'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2480768914758626173</id><published>2021-03-07T12:03:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2021-03-07T12:03:35.737-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Sociological Remarks</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYIvpFXETa41I86I-U18vYWkrSPHxVnL9-N7l0fe4csoPhFMbDZqqkqOCo6gBqinZeMc3wb31v_W-PPEcqheBJMd4Y5OmkG_bvbF2GfMYlxT-2AU7PRAO2wKrgr1eqpLp_3Myv/s750/Lil_Library.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;750&quot; data-original-width=&quot;680&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYIvpFXETa41I86I-U18vYWkrSPHxVnL9-N7l0fe4csoPhFMbDZqqkqOCo6gBqinZeMc3wb31v_W-PPEcqheBJMd4Y5OmkG_bvbF2GfMYlxT-2AU7PRAO2wKrgr1eqpLp_3Myv/w363-h400/Lil_Library.jpg&quot; width=&quot;363&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;As the son of a city planner, I have to enjoy the dissonant zoning.

After the personal bionics, the avatar, and those around us, we want our machines to work, especially the life sustaining ones, like the furnace, air conditioner, for many a car. I running a two person household yet managing my Oregon Curriculum Network on top of that, pumping memes to the world.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s thanks to appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, the clothes washer went out.&amp;nbsp; My ex Sandia Labs friend, with the can do attitude, was all ready to buy some parts and dive in.&amp;nbsp; Bill Shepherd rescued my DVD player by soldering a new capacitor to the circuit board, per online advice.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps $60 in parts and some hours, would make the Kenmore good as new.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling around for a repair person wasn&#39;t getting me anywhere.&amp;nbsp; The web machine is still directing calls, but these go to a black hole. The economy is still in suspension.&amp;nbsp; The economy would prefer I buy a new washing machine.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what the stimulus check, if there is one, could be for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Sandia friend was also ready to solve the BP crisis, when British Petroleum (aka the Pentagon) trashed the Gulf of Mexico. Patrick had his aquarium tank fired up and started prototyping these giant sucking contraptions (giant at scale), designed for ordinary fishing boats to use.&amp;nbsp; Mobilize the fleet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s taken on other challenges: the python invasion in the Everglades; the need for easy verification of vaccinated status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sense of the problem with the washer is there&#39;s no diagnosis by telepathy. One has to take it apart to see what&#39;s wrong.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve had it for more than five years probably, and it&#39;s not under any kind of extended protection plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying a new appliance, and protection plan, in this day and age, is a statement of confidence about our civilization, and even about so-called &quot;capitalism&quot; (a word I use for something else, but never mind). I&#39;m expecting Home Depot to be around for another five years, and maybe even expand to other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to get back to tourism, and not tourism in camo.&amp;nbsp; In exporting its youth in military uniform, instead of as civilians, the Americans wasted a few generations.&amp;nbsp; People are entitled to UBI as compensation for all this abuse maybe.&amp;nbsp; Monkey rule of humanity has been a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh69zQ1skY62w7az-QtEZ9mBYHbzu46xSBoKPB0HWmNIdrILoVC0HEtUpkF7YoKhcSwhnBlicYlG3FoSCZgrAdu8Gh7xfMq8hUFxXQFxMPMP4D1SFA1Rwk_UU9NSbYsb0cHUQk_/s982/moneky_rule.gif&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;982&quot; data-original-width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh69zQ1skY62w7az-QtEZ9mBYHbzu46xSBoKPB0HWmNIdrILoVC0HEtUpkF7YoKhcSwhnBlicYlG3FoSCZgrAdu8Gh7xfMq8hUFxXQFxMPMP4D1SFA1Rwk_UU9NSbYsb0cHUQk_/w213-h400/moneky_rule.gif&quot; width=&quot;213&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1901105511149676141'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1901105511149676141'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/02/appliance-connection.html' title='Appliance Connection'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh69zQ1skY62w7az-QtEZ9mBYHbzu46xSBoKPB0HWmNIdrILoVC0HEtUpkF7YoKhcSwhnBlicYlG3FoSCZgrAdu8Gh7xfMq8hUFxXQFxMPMP4D1SFA1Rwk_UU9NSbYsb0cHUQk_/s72-w213-h400-c/moneky_rule.gif" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-6298390471970068442</id><published>2021-02-18T08:26:00.003-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-26T01:14:26.548-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Of EQ and IQ</title><content type='html'>From the &lt;i&gt;Polymaths &amp;amp; Polymathy&lt;/i&gt; group on Facebook:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it&#39;s true that IQ is measurable and EQ is not, meaning you can&#39;t walk around with a numeric bell curve score for your EQ, that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t each have a sense of gaining and losing EQ points over a lifetime.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can suddenly have insights and understand yourself and others a lot better. Part of that just takes growing to adulthood. You gain empathy for people raising kids, by raising kids, and so on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the game in both cases is to guard against losing points, which means exercise and train to stay at full potential (for you).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe EQ is trained by novels, movies, soaps, TV series (not all of them, just the ones that do). Also travel. Having friendships and community. EQ is developed and cultivated.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if we think IQ is somewhat fixed (everyone has a maximum they can&#39;t go beyond, similar to physical height and/or maximum strength), there&#39;s the question of whether we value it or not and/or have opportunities to &quot;work out&quot; in order to live up to our full potential.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we&#39;re not rewarded for physical strength. Likewise, you my be stuck in a routine, not of your own making if you&#39;re not free, that has no use for your stellar IQ. Picture an Elon Musk type wasting away on a marijuana charge in Texas. Times a million around the world.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Humans deliberately sabotage their own smarts, to conform to social norms. Women have been especially so encouraged.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d say a polymath is someone who (a) values both IQ and EQ and (b) strives to &quot;stay in shape&quot; which means &quot;round&quot; (as in well-rounded). Life by its very nature is multi-topic, multi-subject, so the very process of staying in shape is going to take care of the poly part.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6298390471970068442'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6298390471970068442'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/02/of-eq-and-iq.html' title='Of EQ and IQ'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2270530957094817130</id><published>2021-02-16T12:39:00.004-08:00</published><updated>2024-07-15T08:19:19.994-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Playing World Game</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/QOwW5wdIt_w&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How does one play it, this World Game thing I&#39;ve been talking about?  Even the subtitle of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grain of Sand&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;blog&lt;/a&gt; is Kirby Plays World Game.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, I&#39;d say Natasha here in this Youtube is a player, in that she&#39;s sharing about growing up in her hometown. I just came across her channel recently, starting with the one where she takes us on a tour of her dorm block in her language school.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s on a seventh floor sharing the space with her sister, likewise a language student.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Natasha had elected to learn Japanese, however owing to a teacher shortage, she was assigned Chinese instead, and English.&amp;nbsp; Her English is already quite good, which helps her join the world of traveling Youtube bloggers, the new citizen diplomats.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That sounds like a more exalted title -- &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2024/07/attitude-tuning.html&quot;&gt;citizen diplomat&lt;/a&gt;&quot; -- but its in some ways redundant.&amp;nbsp; As a player, you&#39;ll likely speak up for, most identify with, a subset of the total team.&amp;nbsp; This will help others communicate with you, through a somewhat standardized API.&amp;nbsp; You identify with some country, nation, camp, tribe or company and thereby serve as a representative or ambassador therefrom.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps your nation is one of the diaspora nations, not on any UN-approved map at this time?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Speaking of maps, Fuller&#39;s Dymaxion Projection was generally devoid of political data, sticking nominally to temperature (global average). The map was positioned in this way partly because of its role in the space of citizen diplomacy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Were Bucky to have published a veridical &lt;i&gt;political&lt;/i&gt; map, he would have had to copy an authority, such as the United Nations, or maybe would have planted his own flag in some way, by drawing different borders. Either way, he would have taken a position on many political issues, simply by showing borders.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rather than get involved in such border disputes, Bucky made it so that any nationalism worth its salt is concerned with the welfare of the entire game board.&amp;nbsp; He would supply and artifact, neutrally devoid of political data, and leave it to the individual players how they wanted to value-add.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Parochial adherence to some specific jurisdiction could be seen as negligent. Looking out for the welfare of a people, was tantamount to taking the welfare of all of the peoples into account.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re a single unified ecosystem, a planet, with or without competently designed systems on the humans&#39; part.&amp;nbsp; And that&#39;s where World Game comes in, and playing with competence.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2270530957094817130'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2270530957094817130'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/02/playing-world-game.html' title='Playing World Game'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/QOwW5wdIt_w/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2507344896036682998</id><published>2021-02-14T23:11:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-14T23:11:49.936-08:00</updated><title type='text'>From My Outbox</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;We could artificially create human &quot;breeds&quot; with pedigrees, and a lot of this goes on with inbreeding and nobility.&amp;nbsp; If we really wanted to play the game of &quot;purebreds&quot; versus &quot;mongrels&quot; in the human sphere, we could.&amp;nbsp; But for the most part, we don&#39;t want to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;When it comes to typifying humans by genetic makeup, there&#39;re so many ways to slice and dice.&amp;nbsp; Why aren&#39;t dwarves a race, or albinos?&amp;nbsp; We say &quot;genetic anomaly&quot; or whatever, but any genetic characteristic might be lumped into a breed or &quot;race&quot; by convention, should we wish it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;We could easily have &quot;races of human&quot; based on blood type only.&amp;nbsp; This would satisfy no one of course, because the whole point of racism is to have distinguishable outward characteristics that allow one to be classified.&amp;nbsp; Like if you speak Italian as a first language, you&#39;re obviously of the Italian race and so on. :-D&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #888888;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_default&quot; style=&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;background-color: white;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2507344896036682998'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2507344896036682998'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/02/from-my-outbox.html' title='From My Outbox'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5846088498823332536</id><published>2021-02-11T22:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-11T22:34:08.182-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Learning to Work Remotely: An End in Itself</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back when O&#39;Reilly paid our way to professional development experiences, I got to hang out with the&amp;nbsp; distance learning crowd (USDLA) &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/05/revisiting-heartland.html&quot;&gt;in St. Louis&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Or maybe I should say &quot;distance teaching&quot; as I was learning from the teaching end of the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of that was pre pandemic of course, at the time of the big earthquake in Nepal. I remember Leela (then Lindsey) calling me in my Hilton hotel room from Kathmandu, to say she was OK.&amp;nbsp; Hilton had taken over a goodly portion of the old Union Station in downtown STL, the site of our conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In those days, Michigan was giving some kids opportunities to take a distance learning class as an experience in itself.&amp;nbsp; A special school had set up facilities in several metro areas, whereby the kids would be in a learning facilities, complete with snacks and exercise equipment -- but their teachers were far away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They could practice their Zoom skills, or the old timey equivalent.&amp;nbsp; They could get ready for remote work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of schooling today, is around developing the skills needed to work remotely.&amp;nbsp; Developing those abilities is an end in itself as well as a means to an end.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some teachers specialize in teaching remotely just as some specialize in teaching gym or home economics.&amp;nbsp; But then remote teaching works best for some subject matter, such as maybe history and computer science.&amp;nbsp; YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5846088498823332536'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5846088498823332536'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/02/learning-to-work-remotely-end-in-itself.html' title='Learning to Work Remotely: An End in Itself'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-720313132964371028</id><published>2021-02-08T12:24:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2021-02-08T12:25:24.990-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Contra Opinionism</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I was grousing the other day about what Individualism (individuation) is not, actually reiterating a pet peeve of mine, first consciously formulated around high school.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now these were good schools mind you, as the parents were already at the top of their games usually, living a high life of some kind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they all said they wanted you to learn was &quot;critical thinking&quot; which means how to think critically, but what does that in fact mean, let us pause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What &quot;critical thinking&quot; doesn&#39;t mean, yet what comes across as a poor substitute, is being strongly opinionated on a wide variety of topics.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;The white African pictured above [Facebook] is of course &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/03/chappie-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Yolandi Visser&lt;/a&gt;.

The idea of &quot;white Africans&quot; is nothing jarring or new. White refers to skin color yes, not race really.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There&#39;s no &quot;race&quot; gene and conflating the world to &quot;white brown yellow red black&quot; is just comic book cartoonery. Fits on a brochure. Keep it simple, and stupid (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.meetup.com/thinkingsociety/events/275494832/&quot;&gt;KISS of death&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: none; margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; padding: 0px; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Re: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2020/06/my-parents-perspective-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;My Parents&#39; Perspective | 親からの観点 (movie review)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tiffany doesn&#39;t identify as 3rd culture because she associates that with international schools, which she didn&#39;t go to. Fair enough.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Her dad tells the story of how, when Tiffany was growing up in Japan, she&#39;d talk about skin color very literally, as in RGB values. A person might be light pink, or tan, or... given her own dark skin, she&#39;d of course know the difference. But it wasn&#39;t about race, yet. Then, after some time back in the states, Tiffany came home and talked about a &quot;black&quot; person, where you could tell the meaning had shifted, and literal color was no longer the meaning. That day was sweetly sad, a loss of innocence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The racist meme virus had claimed another victim in a way.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If hair, eye and/or skin color were a reliable indicator of ethnicity and personality then I could see where racism could keep a toehold. &quot;White skin means you think as I do&quot; -- that could work in some isolated setting, but fewer and fewer settings are that isolated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, as Somalis repatriate in Tennessee, for example, you get ethnic tensions and rebalancings that belie the simplicity of &quot;skin color&quot; as the key parameter. People want to hate each other first, and look for distinguishing physical characteristics second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the language of the data scientist, skin color, eye shape, body type etc. have become less and less principal components in our model of the human persona.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, I am often seeking out ethnicity when I meet a person (say it&#39;s a date), which means everything from what magazines do they read (do they read), what profession and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, like an idiot, I conclude from skin color that I&#39;m free to talk down or be rude somehow, as if I&#39;m superior, then I stereotype myself more and more as a typical jerk. My reflexes are seeming more and more awkward as I&#39;m surprised again and again by how sad and clownish I&#39;ve become. Racism leads to awkward embarrassment, which is what is ultimately going to extinguish it, more than ratiocination, I&#39;d hazard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case in point, my family, Quaker, once stayed at the home of then deputy defense minister of the RSA, formerly with African National Congress and now married into the Routledge family and a Friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That RSA would appoint a pacifist to the defense ministry was creative. On trips to weapons bazaars, where they&#39;d wanna sell you every type of fighter jet this and bazooka that, the booth people would inevitably swarm around the little guy, assuming &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/190&quot;&gt;Nozizwe&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was the personal assistant. Imagine their surprise. 😀&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Per my angle, &quot;race&quot; is hokum and a racist is someone who believes in races. That&#39;s OK though. Nationalists believe in nations, likewise social constructs and not unrelated. I don&#39;t expect either racists or nationalists to die out anytime soon, even if my own ethnicity takes neither too seriously.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mission is to not force &quot;true beliefs&quot; on people, let them believe whatever crap they like and feed them anyway, don&#39;t hold their bodies hostage to meme viruses. Give everyone a fun life if possible. Waste less and we&#39;ll get there.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like &quot;ethnicity&quot; (over &quot;race&quot;) for being plastic. Steve Martin raised black in the south in The Jerk comes to mind.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my high school in the Philippines and subsequent immersion in Asian cultures, plus my own studies and who knows what else, I have no worries identifying as Asian if people ask. Of course I know it&#39;s not my ethnicity they usually care about. The little check boxes are about my &quot;race&quot;. I dutifully check &quot;white&quot; and inwardly sneer at my stupid ancestors and their superstitions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of myself as Asian puts some distance between me and these other domestics around me, the ones who never left and don&#39;t share my 3rd culture expat upbringing. Feels right (to put some distance).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/09/gender-wars.html&quot;&gt;As to gender&lt;/a&gt;, I get from theater that we are able to play characters in movies, and it might get to where your &quot;home character&quot; is like a female even if your body is XY. A whole city, like Portland, might agree to go with that convention, that regardless of your body&#39;s XX or XY, you have a right to define a home base character of any gender.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#39;s like a fleeting and fragile overlay in a subculture, like Vienna being sensitive to a special music. Outsiders are just gonna see it as weird, take offense, and think Portland is trying to export its idea of &quot;life as theater&quot; to the world (whereas in fact Portland is inward-turned and sometimes forgets there&#39;s &quot;a world&quot; out there).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8583922269345905583'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/8583922269345905583'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/01/more-remarks-on-race-revised-extended.html' title='More Remarks on Race, Revised &amp; Extended'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-444941605807987640</id><published>2020-12-29T11:28:00.004-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-29T11:30:25.089-08:00</updated><title type='text'>In Defense of Public Medicine</title><content type='html'>Dr. Fauci gets a lot of criticism for &quot;lying&quot; and &quot;moving the goalposts&quot; etc. however let&#39;s think about medical practice more generally.&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;I may wish the doctor to only address my rational ego, to enlist the support of the persona I might imagine myself to be, and yes, that&#39;s important, but long practice has taught the doctor it&#39;s also a good idea to scare the bejeezus out of me a little, hit a button.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flip side: the doctor knows I might live longer and more happily if I don&#39;t get the full &quot;benefit&quot; of knowing in detail all that could go wrong, given whatever condition.

Our front liners will have to do what they&#39;re doing now, reuse surgical masks for days, like in Haiti. I know you. You&#39;ll break your promises in a heartbeat when confronted with the actual situation.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#39;s great about Dr. Fauci is he comes out later and reveals his technique, like a magician explaining his trick.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or he&#39;ll even tell you at the same time as he&#39;s &quot;lying&quot;: &quot;yes, I&#39;m moving the goalposts because if you&#39;re tantalized by the prospect of &#39;herd immunity&#39; you might start acting even dumber, idiot human that you be&quot; (that&#39;s &quot;honest Dr. Fauci&quot; again).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, the medical profession includes psychology, and much as we like to imagine ourselves as rational beings, the model must be developed empirically, not just on wishful thinking. &lt;br /&gt;Doctors as a part of their professionalism are not allowed to take our so-called &quot;rational selves&quot; too seriously.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;Advertising, for better or worse, also includes psychology, and the lesson there is the same: if you want to induce a specific behavior pattern, it&#39;s more effective to bypass the rational &quot;talk to me&quot; earnest individual who erroneously regards itself as an in control sole proprietor of its psyche. Better to talk to the subconscious demon who actually runs the place. Politics 101.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes we get lonely, we rational cogitos, so well educated and introspective, because none of the institutions are really wanting to communicate with us as reasoning brainiacs. They&#39;re all too busy manipulating us to give us that courtesy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;But hey, that&#39;s a strategy based on results, and not entirely misguided. I&#39;m for cutting public medicine (its practice) some slack.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/444941605807987640'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/444941605807987640'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2020/12/in-defense-of-public-medicine.html' title='In Defense of Public Medicine'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2462734965346423255</id><published>2020-12-24T00:09:00.007-08:00</published><updated>2020-12-24T00:25:58.328-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Great Unraveling</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oQwuxGSTwj0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; quickly jumped on Cozy Bear as a culprit, in connection with the SolarWinds narrative, undermines Russiagate.&amp;nbsp; The evidence-free fingering of the GRU makes the CrowdStrike story inside the Mueller Report less credible.

It goes directly to the imagination and fills your head. Cartesian coordinates are welcome (but we glance at Quadrays for a different perspective).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get comfortable with these geometric concepts early (in connection with natural and human designed architectures) and that means you get the history too: this bold futurist (tons of materials) returned from obscurity, thanks to his invisible army (fans, colluders, many of them Chinese speakers), and now it&#39;s not all doom and gloom, even though peak oil and climate change are still real (not denied). That bold futurism has returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it would take is like a cooking show with polyhedron measuring bowls and some cartoons (animations). Given Youtube, you don&#39;t even need to wait for the classroom teachers to get on board (they tend to be extensions of big publishers -- I used to work at McGraw-Hill and saw it from that angle). But you do need to give kids some clues. Needles in haystacks take a long time to find (especially if you&#39;re not even looking for them).&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re one popular program away (like Sesame Street) from kids being fluent enough to know of their Dymaxion Map (Fuller Projection) and all those other conceptual tools he bequeathed to them, that the &quot;corporate personae&quot; (the liability limiting master controller pseudo adults) are now sitting on, withholding, deliberately suppressing, precisely because our American heritage is not consistent with the Great Tragedy scenarios they have in store for us humans (endless war, misery for the many, unfettered greed for the few --- we&#39;ve already been herded around their block a few times, sacrificing the kids instead of teaching them).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;(from somewhere on Facebook)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5423792877414930681'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5423792877414930681'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2020/12/withholding-more-than-taxes.html' title='Withholding More Than Taxes'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjs8axAnMw_v92131For4VTqxLuBN6NpU4-tQojR4Em_ZH6Oh1K1hkbm8EDB3fXJGs5v84jY3ddPmEwGdPB6RqMzxOzi1kDbCOkndqwvjpkyBwVR337y0ntXrWyFlg1w26vU5XJ/s72-c/smhierarchyanim.gif" height="72" width="72"/></entry></feed>
