&lt;i&gt;calculator of tomorrow: government issue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I try to imagine civilian socialism, versus the corporate military socialism we have now, I think of &lt;b&gt;government issue&lt;/b&gt; smartphones and laptops to any students who don&#39;t have them. Use them from home. Other &lt;b&gt;GI&lt;/b&gt; swag includes backpack and water bottle, first aid kits. Be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Free education will show you how to use both, fight off malware and spyware.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The laptop comes with lots of great free open source stuff like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.computerworld.com/article/2494665/python-gets-a-big-data-boost-from-darpa.html&quot;&gt;DARPA supported&lt;/a&gt; Anaconda. You won&#39;t need a calculator now that you have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/&quot;&gt;one of these&lt;/a&gt;. Calculators aren&#39;t forbidden of course, slide rules either (learn about logs).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The GI smartphones come with the apps you need to navigate government bureaucracies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Socialist bars charge only $3 a pint with no tips expected.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Asylum cities, waystations for refugees, dot the globe, thanks to world organization.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do we still have a private sector? Of course. Mom and pop businesses, private banks, airlines, restaurant chains. We&#39;re less of a ghetto though, thanks to a lot of the smartest most compassionate people wanting to work in government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine a school that actually sets aside time to share about specific smartphone apps. The school&#39;s crypto-currency, good inside school, used by alumni too, works thanks to specific apps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Various games (language games) pay out, in credits good against several catalogs.&amp;nbsp; Academic work has its immediate rewards, perhaps in the form of more time on the internet, slacking, exploring, checking out stuff.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This talk was helpful in that it took me back to my &quot;thick client&quot; early days, pre web browser, when my Visual FoxPro stack, ODBC to big servers, was dealing in read-only health procedure data from the Cath Labs and operating rooms (CVOR).  My RDBMS tables mapped every artery of every patient affected by stenosis or other coronary pathology.  Complications led to procedures and their outcomes, some of which might be the inherited complications of a next procedure and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scene has changed since those days, as data turned into big data, and as analysis tools started combing over larger server farms, using map-reduce (Hadoop) and a host of Apache projects (&lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://flink.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Flink&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Kafka&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp; The speaker takes us from those old days to how we do things today, assuming the need to scale up without falling over.&amp;nbsp; How does one deal with the pressure to grow?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s like sails to the wind if you have a seaworthy craft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other revolution in cloud native ecology is the growth of containerized microservices ala &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.docker.com/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Get a lot of producers and subscribers messaging one another, in response to the streamed data onslaught.&amp;nbsp; Push all the end user rendering cosmetics to the clients, with their web browsers and visualization tools.&amp;nbsp; Customize their dashboards.&amp;nbsp; Some workstations monitor, some upload new data, some report on trends and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I go around with my little laptop, like a guitar, and strum my sound, these days involving visualizing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/4dsolutions/School_of_Tomorrow/blob/master/Flextegrity_Lattice.ipynb&quot;&gt;Flextegrity in a Jupyter Notebook&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I learn about cloud native environments from &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/search?q=OSCON&quot;&gt;OSCON&lt;/a&gt; proposals and Youtubes, and O&#39;Reilly Safari Online when I can afford it.&amp;nbsp; What would be &lt;a href=&quot;https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Clients#Clients-Python&quot;&gt;the Python API to Kafka&lt;/a&gt; for example?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A long gone mental hospital, run by one Dr. Hawthorne, is now memorialized by a food pod, a set of food carts, named Hawthorne Asylum. I focus on those local geographic and historical details for awhile, before jumping into a discussion of Man X, seemingly dodged by Joe Rogan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Towards the end I mention my Quaker heritage, as I&#39;m linking general systems theory (GST), a sometime subject in Quakernomics circles, with American Transcendentalism, a literary movement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although Edgar Allen Poe pooh poohed transcendentalism, lets not forget his Eureka essay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I weave in Col. Prouty in other videos as well, as well as the war in Southeast Asia, around the start of which the OSS found itself supporting the resistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;ll find more high school level American literature memes championed throughout my channel.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VynL70eAd94&quot; width=&quot;459&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The embedded Youtube is Part 4 of a five part series, which I&#39;ve watched before, and viewed again yesterday, before sharing it to Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fuller is adroit in thinking metaphorically, but for most of us, science is a literalist affair, with the true grounded meanings. Metaphors are for embellishment, not for supporting weight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, Fuller&#39;s Universe is light and airy, highly tensile, remarkably devoid of brute force strength or forcing more generally.&amp;nbsp; He flits about, always resecuring his own technology, a synergetic language as dense as Heidegger&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; Equilibrium is the name of the game, but in a Universe intent upon success for its humans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been endeavoring to shed some light on what Fuller branded as &quot;the geometry of nature&quot;, a claim for which he takes flak. Does XYZ ever make such a claim?&amp;nbsp; Is the counter-position that geometry is merely a human invention?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His scaffolding is the IVM (&quot;octet truss&quot;), a pattern found in nature for sure (CCP, FCC), with volumes 1 and 4 respectively.&amp;nbsp; Rectilinear patterns don&#39;t go away, as we&#39;ve seen in C6XTY (another IVM-related space-frame design). His paradigm cubes have volume 3.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By some reckonings, synergetics offers but a small tweak at first, with this shift to tetravolumes, resulting in some simplifications (more whole number volumes).&amp;nbsp; Where that leads next is the next question.&amp;nbsp; Fuller points to intuition, but has intuition served him well?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does 90 degree precession really pick up where 180 degree gravity ends?&amp;nbsp; He seems to think the Earth&#39;s orbiting and axially rotating are resultant behaviors given the Sun&#39;s pull.&amp;nbsp; Textbooks suggest a primordial kineticism for which &quot;gravity&quot; should not be blamed.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Critical proximity&quot; is where the changeover occurs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stuff &quot;falling in&quot; is not the usual thing with gravity, according to Fuller, as the whole-unpredicted-by-the-parts is more like stuff &quot;wandering&quot; (not &quot;falling in&quot;).&amp;nbsp; The effect of bodies in motion on other bodies in motion seems chaotic and complex.&amp;nbsp; Is he seriously questioning Newtonian dogmas?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I get the tetravolumes meme and have taken that to heart, and when it comes to &quot;metaphysical gravity&quot; I see &quot;precession&quot; as Bucky means it.&amp;nbsp; Metaphysical == Metaphorical?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dives into speaking very specifically about literal gyroscopes.&amp;nbsp; When you tug a pole towards you, it yields in a different direction, thanks to its spinning disk.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s precession for you, I agree.&amp;nbsp; But the initial spinning did not result from the tugging, right?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In always shying away from &quot;cult leader&quot; status, Fuller is free to exercise and share his private language, fact-laced and interdisciplinary.&amp;nbsp; His relative success as an inventor, his track record, becomes his evidence that his thinking outside the box (which takes courage) is what more of us might want to try.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Come on in, the water&#39;s fine&quot; is what echoes between the lines.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GeE5WnTUsF8&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris pooh poohs that technology will save us, deus ex machina style. I agree technocracy sounds hollow if the only mantra is &quot;learn to code&quot; in the face of lifestyles vanishing.&amp;nbsp; A work/study lifestyle might have some coding in it, and you&#39;re not taking charity (sitting idle) by studying hard.&amp;nbsp; We need more serious students, not addicted to fantasy genres.&amp;nbsp; Like forget about coding.&amp;nbsp; Read Chris&#39;s books.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A safety net that features study (and not amassing huge debts in the process) is about taking care of a population and cultivating diverse skills.&amp;nbsp; Study includes places to practice, to develop technique.&amp;nbsp; My friend Glenn has all the makings of a makerspace (a term he despises) yet real estate is so dear in this town, there&#39;s no room left for &quot;creatives&quot; (spaces in which to create).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Bucky Fuller pointed out, if you take away the technology, you have mass starvation and uncontrolled outbreaks of disease within days.&amp;nbsp; Civilization grinds to a halt.&amp;nbsp; Technology currently sustains a population of billions.&amp;nbsp; Take away the politicians (&quot;send them around the moon in a spaceship&quot;), as during the recent government shutdown, and the crisis is relatively less dire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris has been a war correspondent in Mesopotamia and in the Balkans. He shares a bleak view.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s not in the habit of turning towards American Transcendentalism and seems relatively oblivious to Bucky Fuller&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/12/thinking-globally.html&quot;&gt;teleological post-nationalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fuller is always quoting Einstein to the effect that human psychology boils down to a fear versus longing axis.&amp;nbsp; Chris&#39;s audience is wondering about hope, longing for a brighter view of the future.&amp;nbsp; Hedges is focused on ending tyranny by inspiring fear among the would-be tyrants. He has little patience for what he considers &quot;hope mania&quot; minus concerted resistance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2020/02/midsummers-dream-in-portland.html&quot;&gt;positive future vision&lt;/a&gt; after that?&amp;nbsp; What would winning mean? Where&#39;s the science fiction?&amp;nbsp; A clear view of a more positive, yet attainable, future is ultimately subversive vis-a-vis any status quo dystopia, especially when the pathway forward is nonviolent.&lt;/div&gt;

Changing the headlamp of a car is not supposed to be difficult.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s a consumer vehicle.&amp;nbsp; Simple repairs, like changing a light bulb, don&#39;t require a mechanic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was my experience today, though it wasn&#39;t the headlamp, but the front turn signal, underneath. I knew that, but tackled the wrong bulb in any case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But then it looked like it might&#39;ve needed changing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I rationalized the two trips to O&#39;Reilly auto parts (not be be confused with the O&#39;Reilly School I used to work at).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier in the day, Flickr was down and my Youtube was a lot about that, figuring out it wasn&#39;t &quot;just me&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Then service was restored and I was back to taking it for granted.&amp;nbsp; By the end&amp;nbsp; of the day, I&#39;d decided to give up on that Youtube.&amp;nbsp; No longer relevant enough to be worth all the post production.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made it to El Mercado, where I went with Dr. D. for Solar New Years.&amp;nbsp; Last night, a went to Laurelhurst and saw &lt;i&gt;Knives Out&lt;/i&gt; with Dr. T., but I&#39;ve not reviewed it yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yesterday I tested out the collision detection exhibit &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/rpAE_ogXKcE&quot;&gt;I yakked about in the Youtube&lt;/a&gt; from a day earlier.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll likely use it again tomorrow as the curriculum is pretty much the same across the two zones (regional and anywhere).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
At the end of this one, I wish people Happy New Year on the &quot;AD/BC calendar&quot;, an idiosyncratic name for the proleptic Gregorian.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I look ahead to &quot;Chinese New Year&quot; (now sometimes referred to as the Lunar New Year), which has since passed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m linking here to &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2020/01/occupy-history.html&quot;&gt;a Chinese New Year video&lt;/a&gt; (scroll to end, after fanciful history).&lt;/div&gt;

If you&#39;re paying to get your American Heritage, all the more reason to not bleep over &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt;, for which Bucky Fuller received a Medal of Freedom from president Ronald Reagan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you don&#39;t know that piece of history by now, consider yourself pretty clueless when it comes to American History and/or Literature.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our high school teachers will make sure you&#39;re not left in the dark.

I&#39;m going back to thermodynamics with its energy and power concepts, along with syntropy and entropy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These conversations deserve more than fleeting attention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2019/07/energy-slaves.html&quot;&gt;so I spiral back to them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

The news story about the intel community using AWS type services for intel work is not surprising, as the &quot;elastic desktop&quot; has become the new normal.&amp;nbsp; Your front end API is to what back end?&amp;nbsp; The answer may change from hour to hour.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &quot;code is law&quot; movement, such as it is, may have its roots in operating system design, as preventing users from sabotaging the kernel, or each other, is really the responsibility of the design itself.&amp;nbsp; The model anticipates bad actors, misbehavers.&amp;nbsp; However the operating system boots with a decisive advantage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even with root access, your new powers may not give you an ability to damage hardware.&amp;nbsp; Once you&#39;ve deleted all the files and reduced the software to unrunnable, an external procedure, involving reinstalling a fresh copy of the OS, may restore everything to normal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the DIY studios at the schools, take Free Geek for example (Portland campus), students are in a position to safely explore root powers and to otherwise practice in a sandbox.&amp;nbsp; The hardware has just been rescued from the dumpster in any case, and the OS, if it runs, is now running in an educational context, like in a college.&amp;nbsp; A FreekBox starts out like a corpse in a medical school, and is reanimated for students and then for the general public (if and when it passes all the tests).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The job of the OS is to protect the integrity of running processes, and the memory they expect (have reserved on their behalf).&amp;nbsp; In user space, the users expect their own files to not be world readable unless they want them to be.&amp;nbsp; One has degrees of protection.&amp;nbsp; However, if the root is compromised, what might that mean?&amp;nbsp; Risk assessment, with respect to cyber events, features in a growing set of roles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of roles, I&#39;ve seen the roleplay and cosplay communities converging in various places around Portland.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;silly job title&quot; trend is sometimes dismissed by the suits, but that&#39;s exactly the point:&amp;nbsp; we&#39;re in the process of freeing ourselves from the suits.&amp;nbsp; Owning the dress code is a first step.&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;d call these a Two Part video, although it continues themes from before and after (regarding the war in Vietnam for example).&lt;br /&gt;

This series of three shows a process for making a meme, using side-by-side images in this case, and suggesting Before and After.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we find out in Part 3, the Before side is actually flawed, and it&#39;s in attempting to reconcile the two tables (exercising a conversion constant), that I discover and repair the Before side error.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cRX5D6VHgY&quot; width=&quot;459&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we approach a roll-over from 2019 to 2020, it&#39;s customary to make forecasts or suggestions, regarding what we plan to take on in the coming orbit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;America in Philosophy&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;sounds interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The whole idea of a &quot;new world&quot; was quite revolutionary.&amp;nbsp; Some people imagined striking it rich.&amp;nbsp; Others fantasized about utopian communities, including idyllic company towns or campuses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QJCil1U8DQ&quot; width=&quot;459&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of that same kind of brainstorming goes on here.&amp;nbsp; Could we have public schools that are also (A) boarding and (B) same-sex in addition to co-ed?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These options abound in the private sector, but what if you&#39;re training to become functional in democracy?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My science fiction speculations are against a background of no public schools, given the American Transcendentalism I&#39;m showing here is Verboten Math as far as the administrators are concerned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, when it comes to art history and schools of thought in architecture, for starters, there&#39;s less censorship (strict editing) to contend with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;344&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EoHulR06PAU&quot; width=&quot;459&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That I&#39;m casting this curriculum as &quot;high school level&quot; makes sense, but let&#39;s remember that level is incorporated within higher level mindsets.&amp;nbsp; To introduce the &quot;concentric hierarchy&quot; at the high school level is to make changes in a parent or superclass, to employ and object oriented analogy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ways to carry the momentum forward through university level studies, such as in philosophy and engineering (e.g. tensegrity, flextegrity...), or even in a philosophy &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt; engineering (cite Bristol, ISEPP), were pioneered in previous chapters, making it easier to work backwards, laying track coming from a future syllabus.&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;ve been studying WW2 again and see Hilter spared Britain because he found the British adorable (me too) and wanted to split the world with them, not wipe them out. A lot of his military advisers knew hesitancy and all out war are incompatible, but then Hitler saw himself more in the hearts and minds business; he was hoping to win with propaganda. His court psychologists were promising the moon at the time.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px;&quot;&gt;
An eye-opener awhile ago was Dr. Seuss&#39;s role, as an American propag&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot; style=&quot;display: inline; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;andist (an effective one I&#39;m told, right up there with Charlie Chaplin). More recently, I&#39;ve been back to Disney&#39;s role during wartime: the army was poised to seize his frivolous and inessential cartoon studios, but he convinced the military the rank and file would respond to cartoons, let Donald Duck star in training films.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot; style=&quot;display: inline; font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: inherit; margin-bottom: 6px;&quot;&gt;
Even more seriously, Disney adapted a military strategy book about projecting air power, and turned it into an animation, narrated by the book&#39;s author. The story is Churchill saw it first, convinced Roosevelt to watch it, and a new approach to war in the Pacific was developed. I&#39;m no West Point academy grad, so correct me at will on the details of this narrative.&lt;/div&gt;

They both wanted to break into the adult world big time with their forms of art. Lo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;oking back, I&#39;d agree that stereotyping these media to &quot;children and childhood&quot; was a mostly Brit Victorian invention (where a lot of the &quot;childhood&quot; concepts come from -- not being critical, a great invention).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I found this to be a really fine documentary.  Haven&#39;t I seen it before?  Some scenes seem quite familiar, and yet as a whole, I didn&#39;t recognize it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over on Facebook, I&#39;m taking this opportunity to meditate on my own mortality.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m but a year younger than when Wittgenstein passed, plus I&#39;ve been watching lots about Walt Disney and Jim Henson, both of whom went rather suddenly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They say our culture is in denial about death, doesn&#39;t handle it well.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a cliche in a way.&amp;nbsp; Why not turn the Halloween season into a time for embracing mortality.&amp;nbsp; To say it &quot;sugar coats&quot; death is an obvious truism.&amp;nbsp; What better excuse then, to add a dimension?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding Wittgenstein&#39;s biography (above), I&#39;m sure it seems dreary to many, given is ongoing depression, loneliness and suicidal proclivities.&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, he lived through two world wars. The world itself was objectively a dreary one.&amp;nbsp; He worked hard to make a serious contribution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His story has finally come together in my mind.&amp;nbsp; The fact that he became a recluse in Norway &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the outbreak of WW1, is a detail I&#39;ve always needed to pin down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve gone back to my Princeton days in some ways, when I focused on his later philosophy and wrote a senior thesis about it.&amp;nbsp; I dashed out a kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/on-wittgensteins-later-philosophy-1503dd3355ea&quot;&gt;recapitulation of my thinking&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Medium&lt;/i&gt; this afternoon.&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;ve been spending some hours in Lattice Gallery, as an apprentice to the maestro, Sam Lanahan, who is orchestrating a whole series of happenings and events.&amp;nbsp; Flextegrity is the focus.&amp;nbsp; My curriculum content has for some years capitalized on my having access to Flextegrity, in its various iterations, as an educational supply.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll find lots on Flickr, as well as Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn has an amazing collection of books, many of them on matters mythological and archeological.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s well versed in a lot of this material, and admires Sumeria especially.&amp;nbsp; Therefore I&#39;m smart to consult him as I continue to explore specific stories, looking for raw material for contemporary storytelling.&amp;nbsp; These days I&#39;m focused on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(mythology)&quot;&gt;Pythians of Pytho&lt;/a&gt; (later Delphi).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New to Glenn&#39;s collection: an amazing science museum gift shop type tome, featuring a plastic tarantula presented in layers.&amp;nbsp; As one turns the pages, the central spider is built, plastic parts fitting ingeniously into place, held to the pages by plastic.&amp;nbsp; The whole thing is somewhat delicate.&amp;nbsp; A rowdy kid, prone to throwing things or stepping on them, might soon destroy this work of art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding tarantula anatomy, I don&#39;t want to call it &quot;simple&quot; exactly, but it&#39;s a fine on ramp to the human system in any case.&amp;nbsp; The heart is single chamber of that pushes blood by peristalsis (the way I think of it), whereas the lungs simply interleave hemolymph with surrounding air. The transport of oxygen is accomplished using a protein that&#39;s copper-based, instead of hemoglobin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may be wondering at my choice of topics here, a seeming blizzard of non-sequiturs.&amp;nbsp; But then that&#39;s what hyperlinks are all about: providing context, where it might be needed.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been looking at protein folding lately, rejoining the Linus Pauling generation in terms of my narrative.&amp;nbsp; J. D. Bernal was a focus across two Youtubes.&amp;nbsp; His lab was about using the techniques of crystallography to make headway on the problem of folded proteins (how does it work, what does it do?).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How I get to crystallography is through these &quot;lattice meditations&quot; (lattice in the sense of matrix and/or honeycomb) and all that somewhat Platonic geometry stuff I&#39;m into.&amp;nbsp; My work with Flextegrity is symptomatic of these fascinations.&lt;/div&gt;
