&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: reviewing OSCON 2005 ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likely it&#39;s similar in Hollywood:  people gather in small groups to watch little known pilots, not ready for prime time in many cases, but take note of this or that actor, screenwriter, director.  You&#39;re looking for talent, even in failed projects.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been frustrated with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6778235&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;the math teachers&lt;/a&gt; a lot, because they deliberately confine themselves to talking about baby math, i.e. arithmetic, all that abacus stuff (place value), the stuff &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3195670892/&quot;&gt;in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Midhat Gazale.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So where do &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/fractals.html&quot;&gt;fractals&lt;/a&gt; fit in?  Will they ever answer that question?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not likely, as the authors &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=206&amp;amp;threadID=1924406&amp;amp;messageID=6689474&quot;&gt;of trade books&lt;/a&gt;, who try to answer such questions for the intelligent reader (e.g. Glenn is going through a new one on the four color map theorem), are not the same ones writing textbooks according to well worn formulae, the so called &quot;Standards for Pabulum&quot; used in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/span&gt; (i.e. in this mindless machine we call... well, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Matrix&lt;/span&gt; is as good a name as any (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/day-earth-stood-still-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;no one is Neo&lt;/a&gt; though)).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believe my case is well made:  the gulag professoriate had no intention of taking our &quot;hacker math&quot; seriously, especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/res-extensa.html&quot;&gt;the lumpy bits&lt;/a&gt;, had a &quot;three wise monkeys&quot; policy of not responding to challenges (similar to the know-nothing approach to Al Qaeda, never deigning to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3298022971/&quot;&gt;crack a book cover&lt;/a&gt;, one of Mark Scheuer&#39;s pet peeves).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How do you make progress in debates when the other side refuses to prepare?  You need to find other partners, i.e. one needs to move on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/yar.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our response&lt;/a&gt; was therefore justified:  to build our own ranking system, in many ways stealing from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/hp4e.html&quot;&gt;already operative models&lt;/a&gt;, and starting wheels turning to revamp the degree system.  More pair teaching and more double majoring, including at the PhD level, would be among our proposals,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/04/last-isepp-lecture-2005.html&quot;&gt;Donald Knuth a role model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Portland&#39;s newest roller coaster, i.e. &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6777885&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;a digital math track option&lt;/a&gt; through high school, looks ready to take riders.  I&#39;m not saying we have all the kinks worked out yet, but we&#39;re not talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/09/powells-on-hawthorne.html&quot;&gt;a literal roller coaster&lt;/a&gt; either, although that OMSI simulator might someday play a role.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/location-scouting.html&quot;&gt;Speaking of OMSI&lt;/a&gt;, I haven&#39;t given up on showcasing futuristic American livingry from that property, per the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/live-in-your-tv.html&quot;&gt;Monsanto house demo&lt;/a&gt; of long ago.  &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3209160306/in/set-72157619014256516/&quot;&gt;EPCOT West&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is taking the strain in the meantime, where we take tourists to see the current state of our American Dream (our &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/08/affordable-utopias.html&quot;&gt;outdoor Ikea&lt;/a&gt;&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know it&#39;s weaponry Americans seem hell bent on showing, anywhere and everywhere, no matter how inappropriate (kinda like Afghanis in that way, Wild West and &quot;old cowboy&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s a maturation phase that goes with any culture.  Sometimes the boy scouts get control from the girl scouts.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Portlandia&lt;/span&gt; doesn&#39;t usually lean that way though, so we&#39;re understandably staying with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/shovel-ready.html&quot;&gt;businesses we know&lt;/a&gt;, such as shoes, surgery and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/more-tech-talk.html&quot;&gt;advertising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of surgeons, I was happy to hear from Dr. Furnary recently, one of my coding buddies back in Heart Institute days.  We were cutting edge, no pun intended.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2095939429457597129'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2095939429457597129'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/screen-tests.html' title='Screen Tests'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/4TQ0E8GMwRo/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-607676484119261160</id><published>2009-07-05T20:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-09T18:04:55.552-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Laila&#39;s Birthday (movie review)</title><content type='html'>This turned into a family event, which I was happy about, and both Tara and Carol expressed some satisfaction in getting to join in, meet some new people.  Our venue:  NW Film Center, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Whitsell Auditorium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Higgins&lt;/span&gt; beforehand, for appetizers (and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/independence-day-weekend.html&quot;&gt;no beer&lt;/a&gt; for me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although a bunch of us in the audience were from Ramallah &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/eighth-grade.html&quot;&gt;or had visited&lt;/a&gt;, the sprawling backdrop was hardly recognizable and indeed the movie does nothing to defend the geography, lets it spill over into the imagination, might as well be &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/favela-rising-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;favelas around Rio&lt;/a&gt;.  I coulda sworn the opening vista included an ocean, but that was before he even woke up (loud noise) so this might&#39;ve been in his dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Existentially, it&#39;s a high hassle environment with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/about-secularism.html&quot;&gt;lots of crazy characters&lt;/a&gt;.  Our protagonist is a man of dignity and fair play who adores his family.  He represents Everyman, not uncommonly brave, nor slow, just a kindly gentleman who would prefer if people didn&#39;t smoke in his cab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene in the Justice Ministry is truly Kafkaesque and beautifully executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My worry was his righteous indignation would get in the way of his having a workable solution, and that he&#39;d spin out of control, which he does, but only for a short period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, he demonstrates what &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/reinventing-sacred.html&quot;&gt;Stuart Kauffman&lt;/a&gt; calls &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/mathsummit.html&quot;&gt;exaptations&lt;/a&gt;&quot; i.e. the ability to repurpose.  His resourcefulness keeps him from being a tragic victim.  We empathize without seeing him as a hopeless case, although one of his peer drivers is pretty sure the story has unraveled (and indeed, things were looking somewhat bleak at that point).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our family man was fortunate to have this home life to return to, whereas &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/wendy-and-lucy-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;our protagonist Wendy&lt;/a&gt; has a lonelier row to hoe as that movie ends.  She too is resourceful.  Sometimes it&#39;s more the hand you&#39;re dealt than how skilled a player i.e. let us not judge too harshly, if we must judge at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara is admitted free to the Art Museum until age 18, is looking forward to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/markingportland&quot;&gt;the tattoos exhibit&lt;/a&gt;, as am I, though I don&#39;t qualify for any discounts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3655785298/&quot;&gt;yet&lt;/a&gt;).  We also wanna make the M.C. Escher exhibit, which Tag was exulting about.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/607676484119261160'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/607676484119261160'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/lailas-birthday-movie-review.html' title='Laila&#39;s Birthday (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7950864561467274108</id><published>2009-07-02T14:51:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-07-02T15:04:02.404-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Public Debate</title><content type='html'>Replying to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Truthout&lt;/span&gt; article &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truthout.org/070209J?n&quot;&gt;Iraq Vote Could Oust US Troops Early&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(02 July 2009) by Maya Schenwar (typos fixed):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Keep in mind that as currently structured, it&#39;s not a violation of the terms to have US troops in combat gear, ready for action, in major (or minor) metropolitan areas, provided they&#39;re dutifully under the command of a senior Iraqi military officer and under strict orders to comply with Iraqi chain of command rules of engagement.  Of course there&#39;s political pressure to not need any US combat forces, merely pointing out the fact that you can&#39;t assume, just because you see US troops patrolling in an Iraqi town, that a violation has occurred.  You&#39;ll need to do more investigative journalism -- as it &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;might&lt;/span&gt; be a violation, just have to dig.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Replying to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Truthout&lt;/span&gt; article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truthout.org/070209A?n&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Kill the Indian.

Of course if we could get one of those new Swedish policies... or maybe those are illegal if you&#39;re a USAer, can&#39;t remember all the details right now. A pipe dream at the moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s too late for &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/04/spring-cleaning.html&quot;&gt;spring cleaning&lt;/a&gt;, yet that work proceeds apace, albeit slowly. I did the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/doing-nothing.html&quot;&gt;Edward Scissorhands thing&lt;/a&gt; a few times around the yard, making it all a tad less gothic, though in Portland that tends to be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3492234048/in/set-72157617563312284/&quot;&gt;an accepted style&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pied Cow&lt;/span&gt; a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3239528251/&quot;&gt;good example&lt;/a&gt;).  We had an all clear dining room table last night, less like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/span&gt; than usual (no mice skittering, no pythons chasing &#39;em (Barry lives in a snake aquarium)): catfish for Carol and I and yes, corn on the cob for all of us, now that Tara has a &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/11/halloween-2006.html&quot;&gt;Dr. Joe brand&lt;/a&gt; smile, an excellent outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 4 plans are somewhat up in the air, as to details (not in broad outline), plus this week is already being busy. Portland doesn&#39;t really slow down much in summer, though it &quot;shifts gears&quot; I would say. We&#39;re happy about our &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Blues Festival&lt;/span&gt; coming around again, a signature aspect of our American heritage, just the right notes for an Independence Day bash. Maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nskstate.com/state/index.php&quot;&gt;NSK&lt;/a&gt; will send us a card or something.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/usia/&quot;&gt;USIA&lt;/a&gt; could respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been talking up &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/columbia-gorge-recent-history.html&quot;&gt;place based education&lt;/a&gt;&quot; again, all the rage &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6770390&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;among charters&lt;/a&gt;, has to do with customizing curriculum content to reflect local time and place, for example who are your neighborhood association presidents, your school board members, what voting districts do we have, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/bridge-pedal-in-rear-view-mirror.html&quot;&gt;who represents&lt;/a&gt; each one and so on. This might cycle by on an LCD somewhere, along with student placed ads to buy/sell/trade bicycles. Additionally, we want to show about infrastructure, such as Bull Run and the tank system it feeds, but that could be more &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/03/human-subjects.html&quot;&gt;an OMSI experience&lt;/a&gt; and might involve actually going to the place, e.g. Joe Miller&#39;s, overlooking said reservoir (lots of history attaching).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing we&#39;d do is spend a lot of time flying over the earth using one of those &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/more-from-oscon.html&quot;&gt;KH-derived&lt;/a&gt; Virtual Earth services, especially locally, as young teens are interested in getting around, should know north from south, east from west, west from north... and so on.  It&#39;s embarrassing when tourists come around going &quot;where&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Atwaters&lt;/span&gt;?&quot; and the guy at the bar goes &quot;no such animal&quot; and yet it&#39;s right in the neighborhood.  That&#39;s because news of change needs to propagate, and the schools don&#39;t engage in that enough, thinking &quot;the local scene&quot; is for somebody else to teach about, and then they complain when the kids tune out.  Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3676113279/&quot; title=&quot;Place Based Education by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2633/3676113279_c378fb7429_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Place Based Education&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/880767761350607954'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/880767761350607954'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/place-based.html' title='Place Based Education'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2474/3682024559_1fcab84dd2_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3514984049622102620</id><published>2009-06-27T18:06:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-27T18:32:18.908-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Facebook Quotes</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3666744642/&quot;&gt;to Facebook&lt;/a&gt; regarding infidelity, in the wake of more news cycles involving yet another politician caught cheating, followed by calls for resignation etc. (hyperlinks added):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I hope we have a single woman as USA president someday, and more singles in office generally, as we waste waaaaay too much time on this infidelity business, not just talking about Clintons.

&lt;br /&gt;
Cyberspace has made &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6767259&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;political lobbying&lt;/a&gt; a whole lot easier.  The last time I was in Salem for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/sao-meeting.html&quot;&gt;something official&lt;/a&gt;, it was to help &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mathfuture/GszzTxcxEoE/ufa3Y3pHXCYJ&quot;&gt;Captain Haddock&lt;/a&gt;&quot; renew his boat license, and no, I don&#39;t see myself as a &quot;Tin Tin&quot; (too much a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/prisoners-for-pelau.html&quot;&gt;bwana type&lt;/a&gt;), enjoyed his adventures though, had a crush on Snowy maybe (takes some years on the couch to get to those).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick zapped me just the right geochemistry info to crystallize a mini-lesson on &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/avogadros-number.html&quot;&gt;Avogadro&#39;s Number&lt;/a&gt;, easy to &quot;crunchify&quot; -- love that nutty goodness.  Lindsey, another &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/workflow.html&quot;&gt;drinking buddy&lt;/a&gt;, is headed to Gay Pride in SF, a fun event for any &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/09/nation-of-writers.html&quot;&gt;WV refugee&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;d suppose.  Daniel posted this great Pythonic math link to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/%7Ejhw/spirals/index.html&quot;&gt;a resource on Ulam&#39;s Spiral&lt;/a&gt;, one of Trevor&#39;s fascinations, good deal.  And last but not least, the father-son Sandes team delivered &lt;a href=&quot;http://watch.ctv.ca/news/clip186877#clip186877&quot;&gt;a primetime performance&lt;/a&gt; regarding their new &quot;how to program&quot; book.  Most excellent (and yummy &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/10/alternatives-to-violence-avp.html&quot;&gt;AVP ammo&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I worked for &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/04/todays-networking.html&quot;&gt;Associated Oregon Industries&lt;/a&gt; it was different, as the VPN wasn&#39;t reliable and besides, there&#39;d be complicated requests, too hard to do over the phone, though yes, minor fixes to a VFP project, followed by a build, means simply shipping a binary, none of this &quot;open source&quot; nonsense (AOI was &quot;no nonsense&quot; about open source, and I do my best to uphold the standards of my client, not my place to proselytize, although within such a broad spectrum organization, you&#39;d expect a healthy variety of views -- mirroring those in the legislature across the street).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The asynchronous nature of cybermedia is highly convenient, like a Library of Congress on steroids.  She checks in, I check out right away.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6766891&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;I check in&lt;/a&gt;, they each grab a copy.  And so on, like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mercurial&lt;/span&gt; (hg) in a nutshell (talking about the Python platform).  I&#39;ll get this &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6766649&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;little cabal&lt;/a&gt; looking over my shoulder, no need to reveal itself, then the next thing you know, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157608139268797/&quot;&gt;some cocktail party&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/bird-of-prey.html&quot;&gt;slinky XX&lt;/a&gt; will sidle up to me and say she&#39;s been reading my blog.  I have to be careful if on chauffeur duty for some &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/metropolitan-talk.html&quot;&gt;MVP out-of-towner&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#39;s unprofessional to succumb to flattery at the drop of a hat.  I&#39;m working on my &quot;beefeater catatonia&quot; reflex, a sort of grin and bear it aspect, while secretly enjoying the attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I started filling out a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/02/scratchpad.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lewis &amp;amp; Clark&lt;/span&gt; application&lt;/a&gt; today, can&#39;t live on lobbying or chauffeuring alone (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/more-lore.html&quot;&gt;other clients&lt;/a&gt; all satisfied at the moment).  EuroPython is happening without me in Birmingham, which is OK, as I&#39;m pretty sure the UK has already studied my open source briefings, reached its own conclusions.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve made a big secret of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/cywar-in-cyberia.html&quot;&gt;our world domination plans&lt;/a&gt; or anything.  What&#39;s UniBasic I wonder?  Live and learn.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/recap.html&quot;&gt;No bizmo&lt;/a&gt; in time for the Missoula, Montana (NPYM meeting) looks like, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/12/trip-prep.html&quot;&gt;PKL&lt;/a&gt; needing more of a posse I&#39;m thinking.  Woulda had to fit mom and her walker, but that&#39;s hardly a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;

This weeks &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Asian Reporter&lt;/span&gt; (June 23, 2009 Vol. 19 #24) has an interesting article by Tomoko A. Hosaka, about Palauans maybe agreeing to accept some prisoners from Gitmo, Chinese Uighurs in particular, although it&#39;s not explained where this terrifying subspecies fits in to the confusing 911 debacle, with fogs of war still swirling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those not familiar with Palau, it was considered a US Protectorate, something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/10/tribal-sovereignty.html&quot;&gt;a tribal sovereignty&lt;/a&gt;, where an imperial patriarchy is assumed &quot;in control&quot;, an historical fait accompli accomplished through generous payments for civic works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The AP article uses the transparent &quot;nod nod wink wink&quot; style of international diplomacy via journalism.  Monty Python should feel proud.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hammering out the Compact of Free Association took like seven plebiscites to get right (the women kept voting for more independence, tired of colonial patterns).  As senior analyst &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/06/yesterday.html&quot;&gt;for AFSC&lt;/a&gt;, succeeding Paulette Wittwer at &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/05/more-basement-archeology.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Asian-Pacific Issues News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I spent quite a lot of time researching the place and its history.  I actually got to Truk, Kwajalein, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohnpei&quot;&gt;Ponape&lt;/a&gt; and the Marshall Islands (and Guam), but never to Palau itself, I&#39;m sorry to say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pattern goes back to the Indian Wars in that the subjugated party is assumed to be slow and unworldly (&quot;stupid Indians&quot;), while Uncle Sam goes &quot;tsk tsk&quot; about all the mismanged funds:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Koshiba acknowledged Palau&#39;s financial missteps, saying, &quot;with so much economic aid (the U.S.) gave us, I guess we were not that good at implementing them right.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;We did spend the money, but we spent [it] on things that were not essential to the growth of the economy, &quot; he said, citing the construction of traditional meeting houses -- or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;abais&lt;/span&gt; -- that boosted cultural pride but are not used.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Of course you have to say they&#39;re &quot;not used&quot;, as the thought of Palauans actually meeting behind their masters&#39; backs would make &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/wmbs-satire.html&quot;&gt;the bwanas&lt;/a&gt; uncomfortable (sounds almost undemocratic somehow, to be excluded from any meetings), and we all know &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/01/other-news-blips.html&quot;&gt;Banana Republicans&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/wall-e-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;their comfort&lt;/a&gt;.  So why rock the boat and risk sounding defiant?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Gitmo prisoners won&#39;t go off radar though.  Many a university is chomping at the bit to send field workers, to get their story in academically rigorous detail, properly translated.  Better access for oral history takers is an integral part of the new agreement I understand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Palau will likely insist on humane treatment for any Gitmo survivors, with Amnesty International, Red Cross etc. given full visiting rights, lest world tourists, important financially, incorrectly suppose the assholiness of the DC mainlanders has spoiled yet another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2559430311/in/set-72157605485853546/&quot;&gt;Pacific oasis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

Our groupies, though XXL in some cases, were kind to one another and no one got hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gem&lt;/span&gt;, star of the second set, sang soulful guitar songs, a mix of hers and well-known favorites, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/06/summer-retreat-2008.html&quot;&gt;including &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mad World&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a song Tara and I consider one of the more melancholy.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6PQFOCGYdI&quot;&gt;Also &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Halleluja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which took me back to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3161813600/in/set-72157612025462473/&quot;&gt;my young Friends&lt;/a&gt; in Camp Myrtlewood (land for sale in that area, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/xrl-in-switzerland.html&quot;&gt;XRL anyone&lt;/a&gt;?  Joe is our banker).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Indie Anna Joan&lt;/span&gt;, first set, has excellent stage presence mixed with plenty of raw youthful energy of the kind people turn out for.  Her lyrics are &quot;naughty&quot; by folk music standards, but those aren&#39;t the standards.  This is Portland, not the Deep South.  &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Everyone is stupid!&lt;/span&gt;&quot; was one refrain this audience could relate to (a guitar decal later:  &quot;America eats its young&quot; -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_Eats_Its_Young&quot;&gt;a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Funkadelic &lt;/span&gt;allusion&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, she brought a West Virginia folksiness and friendliness to her gig that set the house at ease.  She set Duke&#39;s chew toy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/hexa-wuh.html&quot;&gt;a buckyball&lt;/a&gt;, on her Yamaha and started bantering with me when I finally arrived, cursing me out (in a friendly tone) for missing her &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;R2D2&lt;/span&gt; song, which I was indeed sorry to miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d been geeking out, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1958868&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;posting to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Math Forum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, assuming musicians always start late, didn&#39;t yet know about the 11 PM curfew.  This was after a productive three day open source un/conference representing &lt;a href=&quot;http://myspace.com/4dstudios&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;4D Studios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a DWA spin-off (hypertoons etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given my status as &quot;body guard&quot;, Indie could play &quot;Savannah style&quot; (drinking while playing, later &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing&quot;&gt;slam dance&lt;/a&gt;) without worrying about driving home with her equipment.  Some of her other fans, including one from Germany, left right after her gig.  She already has a following, after just a few weeks in town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had another Quaker in the audience, much younger than I (we know each other from Multnomah Friends), good to catch up a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d recommend all three of these gigs: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/cuntagiousmusic&quot;&gt;Cuntagious&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Gem&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myspace.com/indieannajoan&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Indie Anna Joan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to people looking to sample the Portland music scene.  I also recommend Duke&#39;s on Belmont (around SE 27th) as an intimate setting that&#39;s nevertheless pleasing to performers, as they&#39;ve put some real thought into the stage and sound system.  It reminds me somewhat of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.somedaylounge.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Someday Lounge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, next to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.backspace.bz/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Back Space&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in NW (one of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://esozone.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Esozone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; venues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today I walked five kilometers for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;St. Andrew&#39;s Legal Clinic&lt;/span&gt;, a charity &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/sets/72157600269294969/&quot;&gt;Matt favors&lt;/a&gt;.

I introduced him to McMenamins, not far from the Hacker Lounge at the top of the Hilton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh works for ThoughtWorks in Chicago, which reminds me of Patrick&#39;s company in some ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His talk, on the Hack track, which I&#39;m attending, is about hooking to the bash and/or zsh shell and archiving one&#39;s command line history to the cloud &lt;a href=&quot;http://shell-sink.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;via shell-sync&lt;/a&gt; (the tool Josh created) implemented with Google App Engine.  We&#39;re talking about a Python application, in other words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Josh studied Italian and art history for awhile, lived in Rome, Italy for six months, not far from Termini (the train station downtown).  We enjoyed comparing notes.

I caught the end of &lt;a href=&quot;http://opensourcebridge.org/users/7&quot;&gt;the fonts talk&lt;/a&gt; (typography), again continuing an ISEPP conversation.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/reidab/3640252525/in/pool-osbridge&quot;&gt;Amber&lt;/a&gt; is here, Gabrielle was here earlier (I told her I&#39;d written up &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/os-bridge-conference.html&quot;&gt;her talk&lt;/a&gt;), plus I was pleased to follow up with Sara Ford before she took off.  Maybe Redmond keeps her on a short leash? I might -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/welcome-to-codeplex.html&quot;&gt;running CodePlex&lt;/a&gt; takes a lotta web wrangling I&#39;d think, gotta stay agile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention to Steve that Oregon Convention Center does a good job of making a small conference feel cozy.  I&#39;d been hyping the Marriott after Pycon, for the upcoming Django conference in the fall, mainly based on fond memories of early OSCONs in that venue, close to RiverPlace.  Anyway, I&#39;m not on the arrangements committee -- hard to go wrong in Portland if working &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/gift-shop-ideas.html&quot;&gt;with pros&lt;/a&gt;, lots of ways to play your cards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s this geek, Dave Rauchwerk, telling hilarious stories, about making a fool of himself in all these cool ways.  He knows a lot of lore, and lore is important.  Richard Feynman is a hero, not just Richard Stallman or that Oracle guy.  Other speakers brought in boxes full of stuffed dragons, a lava lamp, other swag.  I obviously missed a good talk.  I also missed &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Assholes are Killing Your Project&lt;/span&gt; (so true, why that backspace button is so important (alluding to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/os-bridge-begins.html&quot;&gt;Amber&#39;s keynote&lt;/a&gt;)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#39;m in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Open Source: the Dark Side&lt;/span&gt;, about our tribes, cults, dictatorships, fiefdoms, other anthropology. Jennifer Redmond is taking on the word &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/regarding-objectifying.html&quot;&gt;objectify&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, in particular with regard to women (&quot;or even men as well&quot;, she adds).  &quot;Has anyone here read &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Second Sex&lt;/span&gt;?&quot; she wants to know.

She took off for Africa (e.g. Madagascar) after the dot com bust, returning during the web framework bonanza (PHP, Python...) run by these &quot;rock star&quot;  script kiddies who were/are actually somewhat immature, more amateurs really, doing a lot of non-scalable stuff, somewhat selfishly self-enamored. They&#39;ve not been mentored in pro shops, come straight from hacking on some Linux box in the basement.  How to address this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her answer is, appropriately, anthropological:  we need more taboos.  &quot;Smack talk&quot; on mailing lists turns people off, mostly guys being rude and crude in tiresome ways.  Lots of corporate cultures just aren&#39;t that fun, kinda screwy, lotsa jerks.  Language communities might get this way too, what to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Professionalism&lt;/span&gt;:  dealing with people in a way that&#39;s not personal in a lot of ways, thinking more in a macro way, realizing you don&#39;t know everything, learning the basics, understanding your silo isn&#39;t the only one, has a half life.  Respecting elders might be a part of it, understanding that experience counts for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ask a silly question, and get a nasty answer, that might scar you for life. This seems a lot like the same dark side we get in the closed source world -- not surprising I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s agree that FOSS has definitely lowered barriers to entry, so you&#39;ll get this &quot;bratfinks with power tools&quot; syndrome (could be in suits).  True, we may have disproportionately fewer professionals as a result, but that&#39;s a welcome cost of democratization, plus cultures have their ways of adapting (this conference is a sign of that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/personal-tutor-model.html&quot;&gt;personal tutoring model&lt;/a&gt; is maybe making a comeback, and this might help raise standards and/or keep standards high.  Different subcultures will handle the challenges differently, so mono-culture and/or &quot;one size fits all&quot; isn&#39;t the answer either.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/os-bridge-conference.html&quot;&gt;FOSS covens&lt;/a&gt; will have their own ways of mentoring new practitioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to meetup with Audrey&#39;s mom between talks, turns out we were coworkers for the ESD (Portland Public), working with TAG kids at that place on Marine Drive.

This isn&#39;t Marxism or Christianity so much as a clear eyed indigenous movement borne of pain and suffering, and therefore brilliant, perfect for its time and place.  The film makers do a magnificent job with this, another political film that&#39;s likewise an art film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A chief characteristic of the AfroRegge political analysis is not waiting for external authorities to solve the problem, although international investment certainly helps big time.  The biggest temptation, leading to the longest detour, is to give in to revenge as a primary motive.  You&#39;ll find people on all sides ready to stop and reconsider, and that&#39;s what&#39;s most hopeful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People living in dire poverty can&#39;t be blamed for needing and wanting to self medicate, just like &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/random-zine-covers.html&quot;&gt;Iraqi troops&lt;/a&gt; and civilians alike are heavy into Prozac, plus those Rio police obviously get stoked (the guns themselves are an addictive drug, a symbol of power where people feel powerless -- druglords and cops form a seamless business, is one of the ecological facts on the ground).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poetically, the medical profession steps in at a very high level to apply a fix, pulls a miracle out of the hat, great when that happens.  The DVD itself is destined to fuel &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/charter-schools.html&quot;&gt;our Music Millennium&lt;/a&gt; going forward, which is something to celebrate.  AfroRegge is highly reputable and professional, another group to win games for when our &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Coffee Shops Network&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hits the ground running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after viewing this film, I found myself with Carol (my mom) interviewing Keiko regarding her personal experiences with favelas in Brazil.  That fear of getting lost between the airport and downtown Rio was palpable through her story, even though she&#39;s fluent and a veteran of São Paolo and LA.  Many USA zip codes inspire similar feelings of dread, confront pretty much the same issues.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3100305809558809483'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3100305809558809483'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/favela-rising-movie-review.html' title='Favela Rising (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-4711850424714375250</id><published>2009-06-06T11:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-25T17:45:44.292-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Saving Trees</title><content type='html'>Forest-loving Portlanders have a problem with wasting trees, even if we recognize legitimate uses for lumber.

Sometimes these are Wanderers, other times, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyzy and I walked down to that coffee shop and back in Ladd&#39;s, without Josie this time.  That&#39;d be typical, with no Mr. Spocks going &quot;fascinating captain&quot; (OK, maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotto_voce&quot;&gt;sotto voce&lt;/a&gt; they do that i.e. in a voice imagined &quot;in the head&quot; (the approved metaphoric location for &quot;hearing voices&quot; in western civ -- as long is it&#39;s your own, plus you&#39;re supposed to have just the one, by convention (plus an &quot;indoor voice&quot; for speaking quietly))).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What many Portlanders take for granted, not having lived in other cities, is that adults are free to go about their business &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;without&lt;/span&gt; almost every movement considered potentially scandalous and incendiary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;re &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; answerable to busybodies, whose business is to know your business.  We don&#39;t employ those types of people.  We&#39;re each seen in the company of others, in all kinds of social and business situations, ethnically diverse, monoculture, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then, this is just &quot;life in the big city&quot; to some, i.e. we get &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/gym-meditation.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; privacy&lt;/a&gt;, not less, and like it that way.  Dawn and I took this mostly for granted as well.  I never had to worry about reports she&#39;d been &quot;seen with strange men&quot; (like duh, what other kind is there?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no gossip, but that the various &quot;scenes&quot; stay somewhat isolated, as no one outside the circle really knows &quot;what to make of it&quot;.  This cuts down on &quot;mob psychology&quot;, the kind you get &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/batman-begins-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;in batman&#39;s Gotham&lt;/a&gt;, where everyone goes crazy in the same way at the same time.  Here, we spread it out a lot more, plus pace ourselves seasonally (this is Rose Festival and graduation season, looking forward to some festivities).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that being said, celebrities still make a business out being seen together or apart, estranged and/or with someone else i.e. it&#39;s not like we don&#39;t have our entertainment pages.

This first appeared at the Math Forum, immediately following a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1946718&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;post against centralizing math standards&lt;/a&gt; to protect lazy publishers from biodiversity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The threads I&#39;m pursuing with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isepp.org/&quot;&gt;ISEPP list&lt;/a&gt;, a private archive, involve unfolding this map I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1944282&amp;amp;tstart=15&quot;&gt;explaining to Richard&lt;/a&gt;, about some states wanting to try a &quot;digital math track&quot; in parallel to the standard one.  You don&#39;t want to switch everyone all at once, may want to achieve a hybrid down the road, but for PowerPoint purposes, making sense to the state lobbyists, we just have to keep it simple and talk about two tracks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have two tracks side by side, there&#39;s the question of how to jump across, like if you&#39;re teaching &quot;analog math&quot; (featuring real numbers, perfect continuity, all that ghostly greek metaphysics about infinite planes, infinitesimal points) and want to test the waters on our side for a change, how would you do it?  You could read Karl Menger on his &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/res-extensa.html&quot;&gt;geometry of lumps&lt;/a&gt;&quot; as prep for class, but the hands on would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pymath.html&quot;&gt;more about ray tracing&lt;/a&gt; than clay, as we sculpt with light and pure geometry (not forgetting about textures).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We talk a lot about &quot;the observer&quot; in digital math, more like artists than traditional scientists, who think (0,0,0) is the only important position, i.e. one&#39;s &quot;point of view&quot; is less often discussed (called &quot;objective&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;pretend there&#39;s no subject&quot;).  We advertise this approach as both more engineer &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; female friendly, bleeping over how that works for right now (trying to stay on topic: recruiting from the rank and file).  We have a (0,0,0,0) to tell some stories about as well, with links to some of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/quaker-geometry.html&quot;&gt;the Lakota lore&lt;/a&gt; (again, I wander off topic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqHw9VXIXfz5FRsumP0ofyRUUT6O4_0ZJ8C0HMAYByTrpAmkLu1SaY91gQ0pB1RSmr-udO398PBZNGm4LqU62RYHvhhcr8ZH4pVaqm9dRBmjsZW4nCPCbpzP6qlg5YysBx5DxK/s1600-h/quadray.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 175px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqHw9VXIXfz5FRsumP0ofyRUUT6O4_0ZJ8C0HMAYByTrpAmkLu1SaY91gQ0pB1RSmr-udO398PBZNGm4LqU62RYHvhhcr8ZH4pVaqm9dRBmjsZW4nCPCbpzP6qlg5YysBx5DxK/s200/quadray.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5342854027833075986&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is where the practice of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/pair-teaching.html&quot;&gt;pair teaching&lt;/a&gt; comes in. We&#39;ll pair you up with a geek, maybe an engineer from one of our companies (Silicon Forest, formed in my very neighborhood), and you&#39;ll co-teach a few segments. That&#39;ll get you entre into one of our math labs.  You might have different students.  But you won&#39;t be alone. Training will happen, and you&#39;ll be one step closer to maybe getting a merit pay position in the math teaching vanguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those digging through my detailed posts find out there&#39;s an international component, which I could explain if someone cares to know.  Contrary to this hypothesis of 46 states agreeing to standardize on some non-existent &quot;global standard&quot;, I would suggest that other countries will be implementing a digital math track, even if we don&#39;t, so think about that, next time you want to speak with authority about Singapore or the Philippines.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3898840512763017203'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3898840512763017203'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/isepp-thread.html' title='ISEPP Thread...'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqHw9VXIXfz5FRsumP0ofyRUUT6O4_0ZJ8C0HMAYByTrpAmkLu1SaY91gQ0pB1RSmr-udO398PBZNGm4LqU62RYHvhhcr8ZH4pVaqm9dRBmjsZW4nCPCbpzP6qlg5YysBx5DxK/s72-c/quadray.gif" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7693455069099348714</id><published>2009-06-01T10:24:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-02T14:28:05.182-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Jackalope Down</title><content type='html'>The workhorse laptop wouldn&#39;t boot this morning, I have a number of theories, mostly revolving around hardware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a blow, a set back, and partly accounts for my rant this morning, yakking with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/big-science.html&quot;&gt;my friend Barbara&lt;/a&gt;, a Wanderer in California, looking after her mom.  This is a slightly edited version, compared to the one that went out to subscribers.  Sounds like I&#39;m giving up, but more I&#39;m just venting, cop to feeling demoralized after a lot of uphill.  Daddy bear (see below) needs a walrus (not!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#39;t tried booting off the CD yet, other tricks I should try.  Right now, I&#39;m supposed to be driving people around though, don&#39;t have time to obsess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 51, 0);&quot;&gt;I agree with all you said, totally.  Not sure why desert is your choice of teaching environment, except that few distractions and great sense of space.  Make it desert in winter, not high summer, though.  I assume you mean high Oregon desert, but it still gets scorching there.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 51, 0);&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 51, 0);&quot;&gt; And, of course, solids, shapes, graphic, geometric play.  And always look to nature for elegant solutions to questions of form and function. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah the desert part is maybe not required, just thinking about the XRL (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/shovel-ready.html&quot;&gt;extreme remote livingry&lt;/a&gt;) I want to see developed, lots in my blogs, with a focus on the Crooked River (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/03/high-desert.html&quot;&gt;dramatic site&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the storyboard should be some private sector contractors collaborating with the feds on building something futuristic, the idea being that the feds still do futuristic stuff that&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;civilian&lt;/span&gt; i.e. this isn&#39;t a pork barrel project for Blackwater or other mindless thugs who just want to run the USA into the ground as a mercenary state, which is close to all its become of late, nothing admirable, can&#39;t even think about torture coherently (embarrassing to watch pundits, hard to stomach any TV with Washington DC thinking behind it, so pukey and awful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The goal is to get some freedom to develop a different way of educating our young that&#39;s more generous with technology, explaining how things work, and more positive about where we might be going, i.e. isn&#39;t just global warming or war on terror 24/7, i.e. isn&#39;t so devoutly fear-based or pessimism-driven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s partly my motivation for having a large international component, sharing the desert facilities, other places, with overseas students.  It&#39;d be &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/08/new-kind-of-charter.html&quot;&gt;good PR&lt;/a&gt; for the USA, show we still have a brain of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the fact that &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/08/escaping-light-pollution.html&quot;&gt;it&#39;s all in storyboard&lt;/a&gt; and I&#39;m this single dad in Portland trying to lobby a new education system that pays at least some attention to my Medal of Freedom winning hero&#39;s approach to spatial geometry is more what&#39;s true on the ground, i.e. it&#39;s more last ditch and hopeless-seeming at the moment, given Washington DC still monopolizes TV with its drivel, making Americans look foolish and stupid for all the world to see (not talking about Obama, just about all the pundits who use that characteristic &quot;know it all&quot; authoritative TV voice but actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/mite-fight.html&quot;&gt;don&#39;t even know what A&amp;amp;B modules are&lt;/a&gt;, ergo don&#39;t know shit from my perspective, so shouldn&#39;t be speaking for anyone but themselves -- but of course that&#39;s just my bias against other think tanks that suck, dime a dozen, spoiled brats from hell etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mostly who gets the cool retreat centers in exotic remote locations are these fanatical religious groups, who collect private donations and then have a place to send their kids for higher level brainwashing.  Then they go out and proselytize overseas.  Or they go to mercenary camp and learn how to defend and offend against heathen who probably won&#39;t convert -- so OK to kill &#39;em then, the American way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s an ugly civilization and probably too late to turn it around, but I thought Oregon might make a last stand of some kind, before we sink into the slime of this dark ages forever.  We had a fighting chance. I just want to leave that on the record, in case anyone thinks our fate was inevitable.   We chose it, whatever it was.  Looking back, we&#39;ll see what we chose.  Unlike Brian, I don&#39;t think failure is foredoomed, just somewhat likely, given no 9th grader in Portland is learning anything about the geometry I care about (and a lot of other people too).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7693455069099348714'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7693455069099348714'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/jackalope-down.html' title='Jackalope Down'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2850500759735961933</id><published>2009-05-31T10:30:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-02T14:30:00.873-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Earth (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3580281169/&quot; title=&quot;Water Tower by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3580281169_97de495418_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Water Tower&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Disneynature launched its new brand around this nature film and treats it as a flagship.  I saw it as it was meant to be seen, with children present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theme is family teams aboard a swiftly tilting planet, lots of single moms especially, struggling to make ends meet, dad off taking stupid risks somewhere, ends up in walrus hell (in the one case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I chose to disbelieve the narrator, James Earl Jones, who really sounds like he knows what he&#39;s talking about, has the music on his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the funny parts I agreed with, but when he made it seem this huge ordeal, to trek thousands of miles or whatever, I&#39;m thinking what else would one do with a gorgeous bod like that, if not take it for a spin, a real workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature doesn&#39;t hatch these gorgeous specimens just to have them sit idle.  She really goes for the gusto, tests herself mightily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom and baby whale seem to have the best life.  It&#39;s a long way (well duh) and mom is &quot;ravenous&quot; but when they flap their arms in the storm like that, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that scary, not an economic crisis.  They&#39;re just goofing off, enjoying the stormy weather. Maybe they&#39;re just waving at the silly helicopter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you&#39;re really equipped to fly right over the Himalayas like that, then hey, why the hell not?  It&#39;s a privilege, an adventure.  Your instinct is to school with a huge peer group and take on the world, follow the good weather to greener pastures.  So listen to that urge, use the force.  It&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/cywar-in-cyberia.html&quot;&gt;what geeks do too&lt;/a&gt;, using engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nature films always make it sound like the animals hate their day jobs, get dragged through life kicking and screaming the whole way instead of just towards the end (and even then, some go peacefully). Left to their own devices in the wild, most animals are actually quite professional, know what they&#39;re doing, although those birds of paradise looked pretty crazy doing it and the lynx just seemed lonely (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/12/winter-art.html&quot;&gt;and beautiful&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given I&#39;m always thinking about the peekaboo invisible camera, the faux &quot;3rd person&quot; of novelesque origins (knows what everyone&#39;s thinking, some spy on steroids, every gossip&#39;s dream vantage point), I was gratified to see some of those &quot;dork outtakes&quot; at the end, reminding us that humans are making this show, and we push to extremes as well, just to get this film in the can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But pushing the envelope in the human sphere is not like what that cheetah does, so slender and graceful.  When it comes to outward athletics, we&#39;re more like that gazelle, one long slow fumble, very NFL -- and so then onward to something new? (or repeat the same level? -- no I&#39;m not an authority here, go ask someone with a badge maybe)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to mom and calf whale (not sure &quot;calf&quot; was a good name for those), we&#39;ve generally moved from semi-happy camper family to possible predator in the wings, so when the water starts boiling and our storyteller turns ominous, I&#39;m thinking &quot;oh no,  what now? -- whalers in submarines?&quot; (only half joking).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, humans don&#39;t star as vicious predators in this movie (not &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fast Food Nation&lt;/span&gt;), more just as uber-voyeurs (what they&#39;re best at -- spectating), watching papa bear die without any friends, instead of throwing him a TV dinner or something, &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/04/ongoing-campaign.html&quot;&gt;some government program&lt;/a&gt;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, not whalers, and actually it&#39;s bait and switch, because what gets eaten in the end is an innocent seal, just swimming along minding his own business.  Maybe watch &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7sbkKsMo9s&quot;&gt;the Youtube trailer&lt;/a&gt; (46th second), or don&#39;t let me spoil it for ya and see the whole movie, on a big screen with children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any little ones, their first time to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/march-of-penguins-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;a nature film&lt;/a&gt;, and who thought Planet Earth was an entirely safe ship, won&#39;t think that upon leaving (or so we hope). The world &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a dangerous place. That&#39;s what Disney always does so well:  professionally scares children -- including those inner ones adults cling to -- all while keeping that golden G rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mother Nature:  having some no kidding &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/edgefield-home-of-black-rabbit.html&quot;&gt;fun in the sun&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2850500759735961933'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2850500759735961933'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/earth-movie-review.html' title='Earth (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3639/3580281169_97de495418_t.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-8400153261049718136</id><published>2009-05-30T08:48:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2009-05-30T08:53:08.621-07:00</updated><title type='text'>A Coke and a Smile</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;

I think we&#39;ll try marketing XYZ as &quot;old fart math&quot; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/more-dimension-talk.html&quot;&gt;hypercross version&lt;/a&gt; as &quot;XYZ on steroids&quot; ergo by the transitive property &quot;old fart math on steroids&quot;.  Of course this is somewhat juvenile, but we go with the army we&#39;ve got in the summer (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/stupid-summer-movie.html&quot;&gt;not the most serious krew&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What we need for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/span&gt; is: (a) trig (b) &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/more-about-bizmos.html&quot;&gt;GIS/GPS&lt;/a&gt; (c) &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-May/009368.html&quot;&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt; (d) some topology (e) some chemistry and (f) some physics. We&#39;re free to mix physics and chemistry as a higher level brew called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/virus.html&quot;&gt;biology&lt;/a&gt;, use &quot;biomass&quot; as an entry point to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wikieducator.org/GST&quot;&gt;general systems theory basis&lt;/a&gt; for Home Economics (high school subject in Pleasantville USA, home of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/mining-cartoons.html&quot;&gt;Square and Qyoobist Authoritarians&lt;/a&gt; aka &quot;old farts&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These manga ideas go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/mapping-gnu-math.html&quot;&gt;some of the others&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve been storyboarding, blogging about, including a certain castle with a moat and everything, httpRequest and httpResponse suitcases traveling too and from (a kind of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/span&gt; scene, like where they come on the boat).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the core of the castle is our SQL &quot;keep&quot;, or maybe it&#39;s a CouchDB thing for a throne, but either way, the client wants to visualize, which is where the guilds come in, the templaters and boilerplaters (hammer men).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Django we &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/mvc-arcana.html&quot;&gt;talk about MVT&lt;/a&gt;, which is really just MVC but toning down on &quot;controller&quot; (more just passive switchboarding).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/04/mapping-gnu-math.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These castles appear in my posts &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/boosting-bandwidth.html&quot;&gt;about &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Boosting Bandwidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; e.g. giving students more continuity in terms of a place based education, mixing fantasy worlds with their more immediate environment (not willy nilly, but in a constructive way i.e. simulations impart real skills). &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Supermarket Math&lt;/span&gt; has to do with that biomass, sun-powered and dirt fed, water cooled, ending up as food groups with lots of vital stats on the label. Kids learn their arithmetic less in terms of dollars and cents and more in terms of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/burning-calories.html&quot;&gt;calories and amino acids&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Focusing on food without feeding them would be cruel of course, so that&#39;s considered criminal, out of bounds (not a real school, more a prison &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/starvation-torture.html&quot;&gt;or torture chamber&lt;/a&gt; in design -- or an under-served hospital).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/advice-to-synergetics-teachers.html&quot;&gt;the Synergetics&lt;/a&gt; comes in is where you&#39;d expect in many cases, and we have ways of attributing to Conway and Guy where they think Synergetics is too subversive, certain zip codes in Massachusetts maybe? The &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1915468&amp;amp;tstart=225&quot;&gt;uphill battle in Lower48&lt;/a&gt; is around NCLB, as teachers don&#39;t want to do much &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/mathcasting-about-phi.html&quot;&gt;around Phi&lt;/a&gt; or &quot;golden cuboid&quot; and yet this is critical to higher order thinking, not to mention reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/welcome-to-reality.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Da Vinci Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (or see da movie with Tom Hanks).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html&quot;&gt;NCLB Polynomial&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/10/nclb-polyhedron-memo.html&quot;&gt;NCLB Polyhedron&lt;/a&gt;&quot; were brushed aside as so much silliness, as those crazy teachers went on and on with their droning, teaching their Old Fart Math (OFM) and, in college, OFM on Steroids. Really stinks, to be so bigoted and non-inclusive of others all the time (but then hobbits are like that, both parochial &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; proud, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/from-rivendale.html&quot;&gt;Rivendale&lt;/a&gt; coulda told ya that).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So the solution was to say &quot;fuck Loser48&quot; and go with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1944196&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;the Anglophone Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, other places, and this is really paying off. What fun to work with people with some IQ for a change, plus it overlaps with the OLPC and AFSC work we&#39;re doing. I feel like one of those cypherpunks back when public key was verboten, pumping out PGP from New Zealand. Very hip hop, very &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2013/10/october-club-feature.html&quot;&gt;gangsta rap&lt;/a&gt;, very &quot;talk like a pirate&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Synergetics fits in other places too, but I&#39;m mostly just using it as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pymath.html&quot;&gt;a vehicle for Pythonic Math&lt;/a&gt;, helping to jump start interest in blander topics (e.g. &quot;casino math&quot; aka &quot;probability&quot; (= stats)) with the coolest eye candy on the block, bar none (&quot;we&#39;ve got the bling!&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Teachers in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/coyote-academy.html&quot;&gt;other schools&lt;/a&gt; don&#39;t do Watermans (really pretty), don&#39;t play with free and open source software (FOSS), have never heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/octet.html&quot;&gt;the octet-truss&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. Tomb of Ayatollah Khomeini, also &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/octet-truss.html&quot;&gt;Bell&#39;s stuff&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So our tech track feels faster, better, stronger, more packed with useful tips and tricks (e.g Django on SQL, Ruby on Rails... what ya need for that school intranet you&#39;re supposed to already have). We have &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/infrastructure-park.html&quot;&gt;better toyz&lt;/a&gt;, brighter vistas. Let them vote with their feet (where voting is permitted, not saying in your zip code, where you may be oppressed by know-nothings, the status quo in many a backward swamp -- maybe try to escape?).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5716570895930389251'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5716570895930389251'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/summer-marketing-campaign.html' title='A Summer Marketing Campaign'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1549543720267821100</id><published>2009-05-25T12:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-05-26T16:17:33.817-07:00</updated><title type='text'>After Life (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0165078/&quot;&gt;This exquisite film&lt;/a&gt; inherits from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Spirited Away&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Beetle Juice&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Defending Your Life&lt;/span&gt;... &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lost&lt;/span&gt;, or one could see it that way, though it&#39;s also plenty original and deftly executed, a highly competent work of art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every week a few more of the recently dead trickle through the facility, and the only goal for the staff is to assist these individuals in choosing that one memory to carry forward, with all else to be forgotten.  That one memory is to be staged in a short film, to be shown to the staff and guests, and those completing the process move on at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might imagine a dryly bureaucratic process like this would have a somewhat dreary building and a skillful staff that nevertheless has its own interpersonal dynamics, just like in a real hospital or school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You would be right in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Lots of mirrors&quot; would be an easy review, lots to think about in any case.  During the ensuing discussion, Nancy mentioned appreciating the gentleness of the process, whether successful or no.  I had to agree with her there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a close viewer (like a close reader), I think I followed the director&#39;s eye in falling in love with Shiori, a shining gem in a &quot;man&#39;s world&quot; of yawners.  What appears the great self-discovery of the guy she&#39;s tracking, proves somewhat a re-enactment of his earlier mistake I thought, so yeah, like &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Groundhog Day&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Kiss the girl dammit&quot; was all I could think of, from my death bed er chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The venue was fantastic.  The final meetup after a seven year run, with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3563214335/&quot;&gt;striking Jungian&lt;/a&gt; making this her own swan song, leading the discussion.  We met in a branch public library, at no cost, on a Memorial Day weekend.  Some of us had been to cemeteries recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy and I repaired to the McMenamins on Xavier, to speak more of the living and the dead, enjoying a bright Portland spring, feeling lucky to be here.  I wore my USPO &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/11/smiley-guy.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Marvin the Martian&lt;/span&gt; tie&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to blend with my toontown context.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1549543720267821100'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1549543720267821100'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/after-life-movie-review.html' title='After Life (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7494902745558471358</id><published>2009-05-23T09:57:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-06-30T17:53:17.427-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Show Me the Polyhedra!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0JoukX82P2W1cI5rjMQ4wi0gnhLI5rqtqRljL4YkKapdXDvlo05ChxWKPlqIxlH-QsXKtuvn_wjQU0P1swMlDN2yk2nfGZEtMz-0dUZN2jPbRWJAbpCVBNss9ykA0LyveYbL9/s1600-h/24trapcolorcoded.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 292px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0JoukX82P2W1cI5rjMQ4wi0gnhLI5rqtqRljL4YkKapdXDvlo05ChxWKPlqIxlH-QsXKtuvn_wjQU0P1swMlDN2yk2nfGZEtMz-0dUZN2jPbRWJAbpCVBNss9ykA0LyveYbL9/s320/24trapcolorcoded.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5339086393458938162&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;24-trapezoidal combo&lt;br /&gt;of 7.5 RT &amp;amp; 6 RD, color coded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;by David Koski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the PR around the concentric hierarchy we like to jazz about runs into resistance from skeptics, who say &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOYufRHQSms&quot;&gt;polyhedra&lt;/a&gt; are not all that relevant and maybe &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/news-article-satire.html&quot;&gt;lead to gayness&lt;/a&gt; to boot, so lets get back to algebra, easier on the eyes and our delicate constitutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~anthony/graphics/polyhedra/&quot;&gt;polyhedra&lt;/a&gt; are merely the canonical stand-ins for a non-virtual world of dogs, dishwashers and racoons, all with moving parts, all modeled with polyhedra in the virtual analogs (like in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/over-hedge-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Over the Hedge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  They&#39;re everywhere in other words, very hard to get away from them.  You&#39;re sitting in one, 24/7, if we might agree on that grammar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes in my 2nd or 3rd grade classes (following along with my daughter), I would have us think about V, F and E as distinguishable topological features in any scene or painting, also with tactile aspects e.g. an F is a flat surface, possibly smooth.  V + F = E + 2 makes more sense once you&#39;ve imbued it with all this &quot;surround sound&quot; and taken it out in the jungle as it were (edges = vines, good for swinging if you have a Tarzan complex, possibly short-lived).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pre-frequency versus frequency distinction we make in similar terms, of reality versus verisimilitude.  On low budget special effects, you&#39;ll simply substitute a model boat for a real one and splash it around, simulating a perfect storm.  Because of sliding scale powering rules, relating 1st, 2nd and 3rd powering according to topological aspects again (radials, areas, volumes), the physics changes as we range through the size spectrum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strategies that work for a real-sized praying mantis, wouldn&#39;t work at the Godzilla scale, but that doesn&#39;t keep the motion picture studios from messing with the physics.  They do it &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/star-trek-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Star Trek&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; all the time.  People pay good money to see reality distorted (good therapy, good escapism -- take your pick).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in pre-frequency, where we care only about shape (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/terms.html&quot;&gt;angle&lt;/a&gt;), we don&#39;t really have any physics to speak of, just pure geometry.  We might do some literary allusions, talk about cyber stuff, in keeping with the ethereal nature of this so-called &quot;Platonic realm&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/practicing-multiculturalism.html&quot;&gt;some cultures&lt;/a&gt; wouldn&#39;t call it that though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In frequency, we don our BS detectors and start smelling the fishy stuff.  Science is a lot like police work in that folks will dream up all kinds of moneymaking schemes, and yet the science just isn&#39;t there to back them up.  AI gets to be like this.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/posting-from-my-xo.html&quot;&gt;OLPC&lt;/a&gt; makes a lot more sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my own case, Isaac Asimov was an influence in that he harped on using credible science in his plot lines a lot, not just fantastic elements.  This gave his science fiction a satisfyingly didactic flavor in that you knew some of his speculations might be transferable to a real world context someday, i.e. you might use what you&#39;d learned, reading in the car, to pass a chemistry test down the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re fortunate in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/this-just-in.html&quot;&gt;the Fuller School&lt;/a&gt; in that our geometry works, checks out, and the literary stuff is of high quality, and furthermore the physical specimens, the domes and trusses, the house and the car, do a lot of credible load-bearing, i.e. there&#39;s nothing all that bogus on the M-side or the P-side in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/4d.html&quot;&gt;our U=MP&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That high level of metaphysical integrity means our curriculum is fairly easy to teach, compared to a lot of the competing material, which is far more obfuscatory and riddled with pitfalls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/product-placement.html&quot;&gt;poke around&lt;/a&gt;, see what you think after an hour or two.  We know a lot of you come back for more, sometimes as paying customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thank you for your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.europython.eu/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 229px; height: 71px;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgYzxEfzRF4yjN0uxpCtMr5soAZEL3SQPdGxnvNBRD8qaquPVI-gWh8uWXK__d79GOIuDRZraBx22KjYKcDcDPSNgpdFI0M1gXA9Dwj2jkOnlI6VuwInGiVl7WTanLuuv9eZ5rR/s320/europython_logo_2009.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5339073621484994546&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;EuroPython 2009 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;28th June to 4th July 2009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Birmingham, UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7494902745558471358'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7494902745558471358'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/05/show-me-polyhedra.html' title='Show Me the Polyhedra!'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj0JoukX82P2W1cI5rjMQ4wi0gnhLI5rqtqRljL4YkKapdXDvlo05ChxWKPlqIxlH-QsXKtuvn_wjQU0P1swMlDN2yk2nfGZEtMz-0dUZN2jPbRWJAbpCVBNss9ykA0LyveYbL9/s72-c/24trapcolorcoded.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-528411069429522499</id><published>2009-05-20T21:55:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-05-22T16:33:56.462-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Lost in Oregon</title><content type='html'>This was a time for the Swedish side of my family to converge, to a church in Cornelius.  Uncle Bill Lightfoot was there, and the Hancocks, Wilma and Howard, Bo, some of the July 4 circle, which overlaps &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/11/thanksgiving-2008.html&quot;&gt;the Thanksgiving circle&lt;/a&gt;.  We were there in support of the Person family, in memory of Martha Jane Person (April 1, 1943 - May 16, 2009).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a late start then got all turned around in a beautiful and bucolic scene, turned it into an opportunity for worship and communing with nature.  I got to thinking about dad, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-fragments.html&quot;&gt;his mother Esther Person&lt;/a&gt;, Carl... a continuing conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Hancock briefed me in on Humphrey Bogart&#39;s operations, Portland bars where they served you drinks from your own bottle, while you schmoozed with other customers.  Humphrey seemed always just coming or going, so you felt his presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill named two of the bars he&#39;d been at.  I&#39;d like to learn more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vis-a-vis Washington, Oregon was the more untamed state, less under the boot of the killjoys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exploring my heritage, recording what I find, is a big part of what I do.  Call me an historian in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Hancock used to be a nurse on long distance trains.  She taught herself to ski to keep up with Bill and they ran a dynamite ski school when not running the small business (surveying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/summer-of-2006.html&quot;&gt;Their daughter Alice&lt;/a&gt; has been living across &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/my-independence-day.html&quot;&gt;the lake&lt;/a&gt;, having lived in Hong Kong in an earlier chapter, and discovered the container shipping business, big in Seattle, even bigger than Boeing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the reception wound to a close, my relatives popped back into regular clothing.  Howard had his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3550840520/&quot;&gt;bib overalls again&lt;/a&gt;, just like always.  We were the informal family again, keeping on keeping on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uncle Bill, the maritime historian, is starting for Florida in the morning, caravaning along I-84 to I-80, then I forget how it goes, ending up on I-75 in a week or so.  He&#39;ll fly back, although I suggested he rent something and drive it a different way, take a month or so why not?  He said he&#39;d never thought of that, sounded intrigued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gordon and Susan had me over for lunch today.  Susan heading for yet another visit to the dentist, got a kick out of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOtMizMQ6oM&quot;&gt;Steve Martin&#39;s rendition&lt;/a&gt; of that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Little Shop of Horrors&lt;/span&gt; character, which she&#39;d not seen before.  It&#39;s fun being able to old movie scenes of the ether and share them, in addition to just telling old fashioned stories -- those still work wonders as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared an XO from the back of my car with Barbara &amp;amp; Bill as we prepared to disperse.  They&#39;d not seen one before, though were aware of the idea, and happy about it.
