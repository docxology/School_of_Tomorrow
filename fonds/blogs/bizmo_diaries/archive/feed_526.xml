I&#39;m hardly &lt;i&gt;The Martian&lt;/i&gt; (Matt Damon) in the degree of XRL (extreme remote livingry) I&#39;m using. For one thing, I&#39;m still on Planet Earth.&amp;nbsp; For another, I&#39;m not far from Hwy 97, running north-south through Central Oregon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve envisioned my international school headquarters somewhere in this area, thanks to Barbara and Ed Janoe, some Friends living right along Crooked River canyon.&amp;nbsp; Here was the dramatic landscape my school needed, along with the horses, alpacas, and obsidian flows.&amp;nbsp; Smith Rock is a world class rock climbers&#39; destination.&amp;nbsp; We could also teach bungee jumping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lew Frederick, Oregon State senator, was by the Linus Pauling House recently, on Hawthorne.&amp;nbsp; I shared with him my fear that &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/07/rajneeshpuram-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rajneesh Puram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might have poisoned the well (pun intended -- the group used to poison people) in terms of Oregonians accepting an international cast with a footprint in this rural paradise, outside Portland.&amp;nbsp; Xenophobia is sometimes born not of ignorance, but of real contact with an aggressor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another vision I shared with Lew, spelled out more in these blogs, is the whole concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/09/reality-tv.html&quot;&gt;off the grid camps&lt;/a&gt;, harvesting their own energy and food, ala &lt;i&gt;New Alchemy Institute&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Whole Earth Catalog&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ve come a long way since the 1960s, tech-wise if not in political maturity, and engineering firms need &lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/archives/41&quot;&gt;venues to showcase&lt;/a&gt; that inspire the public imagination, if seeking markets for their civilian lines.&amp;nbsp; They have war theater to showcase killingry and do so routinely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/07/epcot-west.html&quot;&gt;EPCOT West&lt;/a&gt;&quot; (a meme) was born out of &lt;i&gt;Dignity Village&lt;/i&gt;, near &lt;i&gt;PDX International&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Do you want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/xrl-in-switzerland.html&quot;&gt;experience XRL&lt;/a&gt; for real?&amp;nbsp; Instead of another make-shift shanty town, Portland would show off the new products and offer tours.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;MercyCorps&lt;/i&gt; has headquarters here.&amp;nbsp; Refugee camps around the world are looking to the Pacific Northwest to innovate.&amp;nbsp; The international school students will feed into our deployment crews, having trained with the equipment and taken in the bigger picture, of a world that works for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&#39;t come out here in a recruiting van, or bizmo.&amp;nbsp; The &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/09/art-car.html&quot;&gt;art car&lt;/a&gt; made it over the mountain.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve got my gear.&amp;nbsp; At the moment, I&#39;ve got WiFi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another Friend, Aime√© Ford Conner, helped me come up with a name for this project:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/project-earthala.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Project Earthala&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; That could also be the name of an eco-village established by the project, and featuring the latest in XRL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m looking ahead to a kind of international tourism that doubles as a kind of work-study. &amp;nbsp; However tourism has been taken over by military touring in large degree, in tandem with the rise of idiocracy, and that&#39;s tainting many brands, and frustrating the civilian markets.&amp;nbsp; We continue to experience high levels of squalor on Ghetto Planet.&lt;/div&gt;

Mobsters accusing mobsters of harboring a criminal element is a sight to behold.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re supposed to find a deep moral difference between &quot;Russian 1%&quot; and the others, whereas Occupy looked much the same in Moscow (a confrontation).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A criminal sphere embraces a more game-like lawful world, sometimes with crushing effectiveness, other times more divided and self recriminatory.&amp;nbsp; The latter phase is what we&#39;re in.&amp;nbsp; The mobsters are all outing each other as the onlookers grow more financially literate by the week.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Trampled underfoot is an old world order, somewhat forgotten, wherein the cyber-sphere seemed less tabloid. The action needed to be dumbed down a lot as we democratized more.&amp;nbsp; I sound &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/08/elitism.html&quot;&gt;elitist&lt;/a&gt; for saying that, but it&#39;s more &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/explaining-esoterica.html&quot;&gt;esoterica&lt;/a&gt; that I&#39;m into.&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;ve been chatting with investment fund types about what Quakers will or won&#39;t invest in.&amp;nbsp; Given a push towards improving infrastructure, ala China, there are moves afoot to contract with companies that build infrastructure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lunch meetup today, at a Chinese place, connected me back to the Hunger Project and Lynne Twist.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m listening to her CDs: &lt;i&gt;Unleashing the Soul of Money&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&#39;s a Bucky Fuller fan, like I am.&amp;nbsp; Bucky made a big difference throughout &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/12/some-storytelling.html&quot;&gt;the &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Has she read Graeber&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Debt: the First 5000 Years&lt;/i&gt; I wonder? She tells the myth that money was invented to rescue us from a &quot;barter economy&quot;, a thesis this debt book questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quoting &lt;a href=&quot;https://charleseisenstein.net/essays/a-review-of-graebers-debt-the-first-5000-years/&quot;&gt;a review by Charles Eisenstein&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Graeber ably and thoroughly debunks the commodity theory of money that 
holds sway in neo-classical economics, which says that money originated 
from early barter economies. This, as Graeber points out, is an 
imaginary history with no historical or anthropological evidence. 
Instead, it projects our own market-conditioned behavior onto primitive 
people, assuming that they, like we, were calculating maximizers of 
their own self-interest. A universe of competing, separate selves, 
interacting according to impersonal economic ‚Äúforces‚Äù, is the economic 
analog of the Newtonian physics that was so spectacularly successfully 
up until the 20th century. It is obsolete today, as quantum mechanics 
reveals the dubiousness of the subject-object distinction.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Do Quakers invest in Hollywood?&amp;nbsp; The military-infotainment complex depends a lot on turning theater into theater, i.e. the military saga into the blockbuster epic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/8dzstxE_5Rc&quot;&gt;or computer game&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Many Quakers &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; invest in Hollywood.&amp;nbsp; Whittier is close by.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, lots to think about.&amp;nbsp; I added this comment to &lt;i&gt;QuakerQuaker&lt;/i&gt; this morning, copied here:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
One reason Quakers are no 
longer strong in business, compared to late 1700s (a time of peak 
influence in the private sector), is it&#39;s hard to work in the US without
 being a part of its military-infotainment complex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Developing sprawling businesses that pointedly do not invest or 
contract with sociopathic institutions would be a huge challenge.&amp;nbsp; 
Meetings themselves, though businesses (if you believe the shoptalk), 
are not public enough to make a difference.&amp;nbsp; Schools, hotel chains, 
hospitals... if only.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
Speaking of fundraising, Multnomah Meeting was successful in getting enough donations and pledges to install the new temperature control system.  Thanks to our ad hoc committee for getting that organized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A 1980s family picture, Dawn&#39;s side: Sam (Dawn&#39;s brother), Glenys (mom), Carla (sister), Dawn. This was taken before Dawn and I met, she the new bookkeeper at Center for Urban Education, me just back from Bhutan.&lt;br /&gt;

I&#39;ve seen very little mention of the geodesic dome, featured as a part of the spooky castle above, where Rocky Horror Picture Show was originally filmed.&amp;nbsp; Much could be made of this link to another counter-cultural icon, from a domain of sexual mores breaking out of their bounding box, thanks to ETs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The point was to visit &lt;i&gt;Clinton Street Theater&lt;/i&gt; where teens, mas o meno, have been doing the audience participatory version of this cult film for some twenty odd years, starting midnight on Saturdays.&amp;nbsp; The torch gets passed, one generation to the next.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting picked as a cast member means knowing the right people, in addition to exhibiting some talent to entertain. Participating in a RHPS is something of a rite of passage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I went with a professor of gender studies and international development who&#39;d never seen the film, turned off by the word &quot;horror&quot;, a genre she doesn&#39;t enjoy.&amp;nbsp; The raucousness of the audience overwhelmed the soundtrack and she came away with a garbled version of the plot, but that&#39;s easily rectifiable with later study.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like pointing out that Tim Curry has a later role in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/kinsey-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;the movie &lt;i&gt;Kinsey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where I plays an ironically prudish professor. One of the best ways to study a culture is by delving in to its sex ed, but then don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking education == academia.&amp;nbsp; All media have an educational role.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My first induction into this cult came way back in my Princeton years, in the late 1970s, much closer to the time when this film, originally a stage play in England, where that castle is, first came out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The on-line course I&#39;m taking asked us to build a circuit of two push button switches, both of which need to be pressed for the LED to come on.  The Arduino motherboard is used only to power the breadboard, very not fancy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Note that a yellow LED on the motherboard itself, distinct from the always-on power light (green), is flashing intermittently.  This would have to do with some earlier-loaded blinking light program, unrelated to the current project.  The Arduino does retain the last loaded program, even when powered down.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;:: talks about CGI in the client / server context ::&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Retro Coding is where one deliberately dials back to an earlier point in time and uses tools at that time considered cutting edge, but since abandoned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A case in point:&amp;nbsp; &quot;Common Gateway Interface&quot; or &quot;CGI&quot; programming. &quot;Computer-generated Imagery&quot; is the more common decoding; a name collision (just get clear on the namespace, for less cognitive dissonance).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Python, we import the cgi module primarily for access to FieldStorage, an object that plays the role of sys.argv in some ways, the latter being a list object intermediary between &quot;__main__&quot; (the running namespace) and the shell command used to start a script.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example:&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;$ ./get_chem.py Au&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
passes Au as a string string element to the running get_chem.py, which finds it in sys.argv[1].&amp;nbsp; &#39;get_chem.py&#39; itself, the name of the running script, is what&#39;s in sys.argv[0].&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
Here&#39;s an example lookup operating, running the above lookup about gold (&quot;Au&quot;):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/35660955965/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Server and Client&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Server and Client&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4088/35660955965_fe6a05e5f0.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s Python&#39;s standard library CGI server in the background, plain vanilla.&amp;nbsp; The going rate is not included. This pared down database lists he abbreviation and longer name, number of protons, and atomic mass.&amp;nbsp; The long integer and KTU track when a user last touched the record, me in this case.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; num&lt;br /&gt;1493462392&lt;br /&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(num)&lt;br /&gt;datetime.datetime(2017, 4, 29, 3, 39, 52)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The invocation in the foreground triggers a little script to send an HTTP request to said server, with a chemical element symbol (e.g. Au for Gold), which, if all goes well, returns a JSON string which the little script converts, to a list.  Print to console.  We&#39;re done:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/35273815140/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;looking up an element through localhost&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;looking up an element through localhost&quot; height=&quot;493&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4217/35273815140_ed0a12c9f2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking a look at that script, we see the Python DBI in action. That could have been Oracle we were talking to, like in the good old days (mythological allusion).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/35273860470/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Serving Data&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Serving Data&quot; height=&quot;359&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4213/35273860470_8e24df2ba3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve changed the shebang line to /usr/bin/env python, which is fine if you&#39;re running Python3 or greater, and shared the two scripts &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/&quot;&gt;via Github&lt;/a&gt;, for educational use.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://workingit.com/&quot;&gt;WorkingIt&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The database table, periodic_table.db, is likewise available.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m continuing to evolve this little project, adding AJAX to the mix.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
The &lt;i&gt;Portland Blues Festival&lt;/i&gt; kicked off today and our Hawthorne bus 14 moved slowly across the bridge, stuck in traffic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was on my way to &lt;i&gt;Rogue Hall&lt;/i&gt; to meet up with Dr. Tagrid Khuri of Portland State University.&amp;nbsp; Our plan: to see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fruitfulfilms.com.au/films/tigris&quot;&gt;this award winning movie&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;i&gt;Clinton Street Theater&lt;/i&gt; (Tag was expecting outdoor live Arabic music, and I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect, but never mind).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The film is a work in ethnography, more specifically ethnomusicology. A lot of the folk music of Iraq traces to Iraqi Arab Jews, who knew?&amp;nbsp; They fled Iraq en masse, after some two thousand years by the Tigris, starting in the early 1950s, some looking for a new life in the newly established state of Israel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Ba&#39;athists seemed keen on erasing cultural memory, but music and memes are more powerful than mere politics.&amp;nbsp; Enforced ignorance doesn&#39;t last.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The film is the result of a collaboration between a Muslim Iraqi refugee, Majid Shokor, living in Australia, a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war, and an Ashkenazi Jewish woman, Marsha Emerman, with experience making documentary films.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The project took about ten years to complete.&amp;nbsp; This was not a first screening by any means, but was a strategic one, with Emerman joining by Skype from Victoria, British Columbia, fielding questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The film succeeds in conveying the respect musicians have for their music, in ways that transcend ethnicity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The opportunity to share memories, life stories, in a relatively safe environment, comforted by familiar tunes, brings out the best in people.&amp;nbsp; The film is uplifting, as well as informative.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One of the great joys in getting married is the merging of families that occurs.&amp;nbsp; In Dawn&#39;s case, I lucked out big time, with her brother Sam and partner Judy, musically minded creators of a new scene in Sisters, Camp Sherman more specifically, in the Metolius watershed.&amp;nbsp; I also met Elise and then Les, that wonderful family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dawn&#39;s extended family went to Indiana, Pennsylvania (a town).&amp;nbsp; We spread her ashes there in 2009, following a Chicago Pycon.&amp;nbsp; Tara and Alexia were with me then too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Compared to our city rat lifestyle, as non-profit hub managers (CUE and so on), Sam &amp;amp; Judy were the rustic true pioneers, living off the grid as year round caretakers of the lovely Dahl Ranch, in a time when the surrounding forest was lush.&amp;nbsp; They hewed their own firewood, kept the swimming pool operational.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later, Sam, a skilled indoor finish carpenter, built a house for the two of them.&amp;nbsp; Judy&#39;s mother joined them later.&amp;nbsp; She died in the same Partners in Care facility Sam did, same room.&amp;nbsp; That was on Gold Coach road, in a gorgeous patch of country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just an hour ago I headed over to Smith Rock for some memories.&amp;nbsp; The two sisters (Tara and Alexia) are exploring somewhere in the area.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Radio is important here, and music.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m listening to &lt;i&gt;Psychedelic Protest&lt;/i&gt; on KPOV FM, a show sometimes hosted by the Smith&#39;s friend Steven.&amp;nbsp; Mad Dog is hosting today. &lt;/div&gt;

When I teach about Python decorators, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/Abducted!.ipynb&quot;&gt;I often use&lt;/a&gt; the extended metaphor of &quot;being abducted by a UFO&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In science fiction, the abductee is subtly or not so subtly transformed by the abduction experience. What&#39;s important is they come back as still themselves, which parallels decorated callables retaining their original names.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the video below I&#39;m using the&amp;nbsp;@property decorator to show how a Circle type might update its inter-related attributes through setter method calls behind the scenes. &lt;br /&gt;

I wasn&#39;t planning on seeing this today. I&#39;d RSVPed on the Flying Circus meetup downtown. Then came a knock at the door and there was Lindsey Walker, whom I&#39;d not seen since last year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had tea on Division at our usual spot where she showed me pictures of her new place, austere and functional, in Kathmandu. Turned out she was curious about &lt;i&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/i&gt; also.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Probably the Bible families won&#39;t be too bent out of shape as the somewhat Bollywood style Greek mythology reiterates the &lt;i&gt;Paradise Lost&lt;/i&gt; theme of Lucifer, jealous of God&#39;s love for his homely creature, Man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aries (lets call him Mars) is a died-in-the-wool misanthropist, and what is War (a favorite form of theater) if not misanthropic?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wonder Woman is on the side of good as we slide back in time to the World War One era.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mars is having a field day and the job of these Amazon women is to defend humans, innately good, from his manipulating.&amp;nbsp; Or so the children are told.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Wonder Woman grows wiser she realizes Mars is a pretty good prosecuting attorney and humans somewhat deserve the fate they choose for themselves, and indeed they&#39;re somewhat loathsome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lindsey and I agreed it was all on the corny side, but then we&#39;re talking about a comic book after all.&amp;nbsp; Serious-minded theologians are not a primary audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re more into learning about puberty and putting our childhood toy stories to bed.&lt;/div&gt;

I haven&#39;t posted much about factoring quadratics, but would for one take a group theory approach if following the forking-off Lambda Calc track after Algebra, more vocational than Delta Calc (Calculus), in the sense of straight-to-job, minus college, for more trainees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;ve got the JS + HTML + CSS, what more could you need?  Of course plenty, and many will head back to college or code school or whatever, but the meaning of &quot;vocational&quot; still pertains.  You get some paid work as a front and back end developer, applying your high school degree, and afford college later, where you go into Physics, say.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where I&#39;d go with quadratics is full bore into History as I think it&#39;s a travesty how we try to tease apart maths from any cultural context.  Enough with the &quot;universal language&quot; already, if that means Greek metaphysics about infinite planes &quot;existing&quot;. That&#39;s philosophy, so any PhD will be able to defend these theses of plane geometry (Euclidean), but lets not pretend that they&#39;re not cultural, and that mathematics is not as multi-cultural as Manhattan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fierce &quot;game show&quot; competitions on the Italian peninsula, to factor polynomials in contest, complete with pro wrestler style champions and death bed secrets (algorithms) is all too much to pass up. Then we roll forward to Galois, who scribbles some final words on Galois Theory before defending his honor in some dark ages duel to the death.  Bleep over all that?  Not unless you&#39;re into &quot;history avoidance&quot; which math geeks are often guilty of, but not in my course, no way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like showing a Polynomial class in Python, complete with some Newton&#39;s Method type convergence algorithm for finding roots even when factoring is nigh impossible. I&#39;ve got this in my archive somewhere. [0]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At least lets tell them about the limits to factoring.  And don&#39;t wait until some bitter end to share the quadratic equation, making it some punch line after slogging through months of seeking roots by other means.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m into spending a lot more time with primes versus composites, Euclid&#39;s Method, because I&#39;m heading to RSA (public key crypto), like they do in &lt;i&gt;Mathematics for the Digital Age&lt;/i&gt; (Bob and I both like it, although I do class-oriented coding much earlier in the deck, see my Fraction [1]). RSA is a capstone &quot;thing to get&quot; in the aforementioned text, used at Phillips / Andover. I teach crypto too, had for years before I saw that book. [2]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why Euclid&#39;s Method to get the GCD over factoring into primes?  Because factoring fizzles long before EM. Then there&#39;s the extended version (EEM). Check Knuth.  These are the algorithms they&#39;re gonna need.  As a mammal to other mammals:  don&#39;t let them write that off as &quot;just computer science&quot; in their snobby mathy way.&lt;br /&gt;

In case you&#39;re a long time reader of this blog, or a relative newcomer with a Sherlock Holmes bent, wanting to piece it all together like a Russian novel of interweaving scenarios, let me look at some loose ends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pristine wood hull motor boat that featured often in blog posts and pictures, especially in warmer weather, is still with us, but under repair.&amp;nbsp; A boat seeing as much use as that one, way above average, incurs wear and tear. The only real question is whether anyone around is skilled enough and has the time. Don and Barry have been on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also speaking of Barry, his big project to keep himself in shape and amused was to convert a legacy motorcycle, a big one, into something two-wheeled yet enclosed.&amp;nbsp; The prototype has been test driven, however the loose end is I&#39;ve not been present to photo-document anything.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s front-heavy on steering and a next iteration is planned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Former housemates have been meeting among themselves, crossing paths at different times. Jen has moved to California with Yarrow, growing up.&amp;nbsp; Melody drove down there and visited.&amp;nbsp; Maybe Lindsey got there later?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not in her loop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Speaking of Lindsey&lt;/a&gt;, a looped through her music on Facebook again, spiraling through some of her showtime posters.&amp;nbsp; She was a keyboardist / singer with a big love for her drum machine.&amp;nbsp; With me as chauffeur, she could pull off real gigs.&amp;nbsp; Archive.org has her at the Egyptian Room in Portland (long gone).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My two daughters are both working hard in their respective roles.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been sharing developments on email with Carol (mom) and my sister Julie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today we had some tense times downtown thanks to various rallies and counter-rallies.&amp;nbsp; We seem to be forgetting the past and dooming ourselves to its repetition but then history doesn&#39;t repeat, not really.&amp;nbsp; OK somewhat it does.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patrick bounced down there on foot, busing back.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re both yammering about Python this week, in a code school setting.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m studying his textbook, to which I contributed, plus we both learned from Steve Holden, author of an earlier curriculum we both used, when mentoring for O&#39;Reilly School (since closed).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of Steve Holden, you&#39;ll find where he bounced out to the West Coast for meetups and business, but he&#39;s a citizen of the UK and has lived there for some time.&amp;nbsp; We see each other on Facebook and like that.&lt;/div&gt;

Speaking of a dropping Portland IQ, lets focus on mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What does it say that I was fully cognizant up to some point, that I would not be needed in Lake Oswego today (because the course ended last week) but that I nevertheless dutifully drove to Laurelhurst, as if today were tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got all dressed up, in my collar shirt, smarty pants, and badge.&amp;nbsp; Fought traffic (was traffic). Finally figured it out.&amp;nbsp; The booby prize goes to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hey, we all make mistakes.&amp;nbsp; Today was the day.&amp;nbsp; Actually it&#39;s already tomorrow. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
But is that true?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One sign of a dropping collective IQ is the water system. &amp;nbsp;Portland had a variance exempting it from having to treat for a specific parasite, one that hadn&#39;t been a problem, until now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The city decided to take its working reservoir system and replace it with an underground one, following instructions from The District, the lowest IQ zone in the nation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The parasite has since been detected, the variance lost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Lloyd Center gutted itself of movie theaters at the Food Court level. &amp;nbsp;Concessions have left blank holes. &amp;nbsp;I guess the whole food court thing isn&#39;t making sense to people? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How can they shop until they drop?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let&#39;s hope I&#39;m wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carol spent the day at Lloyd Center, getting new glasses at &lt;i&gt;Lenscrafters&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The moment she got home, without dropping them, the lens fell out. &amp;nbsp;Then she noticed the frame was cracked, who knows for how long.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re driving back there now.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1103160048186116484'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1103160048186116484'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/05/dropping-iq-in-portland.html' title='Dropping IQ in Portland?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7201395886937607167</id><published>2017-05-22T11:01:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2017-05-22T12:07:25.793-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Pycon: Looking Back</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/05/pycon-begins.html&quot;&gt;Pycon&lt;/a&gt; was very sciency this time, and I&#39;m plenty glad about that. We&#39;re up to developing 3.7 around now, with a lot of emphasis on asynchronous capabilities. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s event loop programming, not unlike event-driven GUI programming, indeed it&#39;s the same (to some degree).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most the examples seem to focus on network probes, and how those might take forever. &amp;nbsp;An await state keeps something trying, working to fulfill some promise, complete some task, even while other coroutines get on with their business. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The paradigm of multi-threading is germane, it&#39;s just Python takes responsibility for expressing how the players should share, leaving the operating system to think in terms of a single process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the keynotes was an astronomer, another a nuclear physicist engineer, studying the complete fuel cycle, from cradle to grave. &amp;nbsp;We flashed on pictures of space telescopes, like the Hubble, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/04/python-gig.html&quot;&gt;the Hubble itself&lt;/a&gt; (still operational in 2017), and considered how Python is a boon to the scientific community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got to meet with the SciPy / Cuba guy, Olemis Lang. &amp;nbsp;He&#39;s facing some of the same logistics encountered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/albums/72157679832806496&quot;&gt;by Steve Holden&lt;/a&gt;, former PSF chairman and conference organizer (starting with Pycon itself). I&#39;d be his sidekick through some of these events, taking in the business in a more &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/09/my-character.html&quot;&gt;backseat driver role&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ed Leaf and I reminisced &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/reminiscing-about-conferencing-software.html&quot;&gt;about FoxPro&lt;/a&gt; quite a bit, another coding language community that went through phases. &amp;nbsp;&quot;Every language has its story&quot; I remind my &quot;Python radio&quot; audience (really more like TV).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jeff Elkner of edu-sig came through as well. &amp;nbsp;This was during booth and poster time. &amp;nbsp;CS is now well-established throughout the states, lets assume, at the level of standards (what Jeff has been helping with, in Virginia especially), but on-the-ground implementation is another story. &amp;nbsp;Urban versus rural: it makes a difference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bridging to the agricultural sector(s) is a big part of what open source is all about these days, because agriculture, bar none, is a science, from population genetics to pathology (we also compared notes with Sheri Dover, also a scientist by training, and code school insider), to business management.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If interested in the Cuba stuff specifically, remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-cuba&quot;&gt;python-cuba&lt;/a&gt; is an open archive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/edu-sig&quot;&gt;as is edu-sig&lt;/a&gt;. Some years ago, Pythonistas came to the realization the Cuba could be another Python hub, given proper care and nurturing by the various users already there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Python use is skyrocketing thanks to a vibrant ecosystem and ways of making science journal articles come alive with Jupyter Notebook versions. Share the data, share the process, with your peers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mostly I served as sidekick to Dr. Charles Crosse, a physicist by training, adventurous and risk-taking by temperament, with experiences as far off the beaten trail in Guyana as it&#39;s possible to get (a world of river rapids, crocodiles, anacondas...). &amp;nbsp;He&#39;d served in the Peace Corps in Kenya before that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His infrastructure for governing access to elective cyberspace, based on fulfilling requirements (buying time), was completely working as a prototype. &amp;nbsp;He&#39;d ported some puzzles from SugarLabs. Reading assignments complete with fill in the blank follow-up / recalls could be generated on the fly. We did one on Isaac Newton, as a test.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The gist: &amp;nbsp;a server in France provided &quot;bird feeder&quot; credits towards keeping the router open for other purposes. Developers, supported by consciously allocated subscriptions or purchases, build these life-giving games (we&#39;re talking about cyber-lives, time on the Internet, not miracle cures, not snake oil), whereby students net metered credits, the currency of &quot;staying on-line through this particular router&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course it&#39;s easy to bypass a router, a Raspberry Pi in this case, but that&#39;s all family politics. Once a given router is accepted as a valid player, according to whatever rules, one has incentive to rack up higher scores. &amp;nbsp;I see plenty of applications to Coffee Shops Network, which features charitable giving games, a casino to benefit the deserving recipients of winners&#39; winnings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The job fair booth people have to answer whether their place of work allows remoting in from places like San Antonio. &amp;nbsp;Do they have telecommuters? &amp;nbsp;I was tied to the poster, complete with working Pi and slaved tablets (representing metered clients), so took my job booth pictures mostly during setup, when I was free to roam. &amp;nbsp;I fetched Charles a couple turkey sandwiches before they all disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My transition to post conference mode involved taking the Max downtown with Charles for a hand off to Luciano outside the &lt;i&gt;Apple Store&lt;/i&gt;, after which I Maxed it back to maxi taxi and headed for the &lt;i&gt;FredMeyer&lt;/i&gt; rooftop parking slots. &amp;nbsp;David Koski was there on Hawthorne at &lt;i&gt;Fresh Pot&lt;/i&gt;, embedded in &lt;i&gt;Powells&lt;/i&gt;, across from &lt;i&gt;Bagdad&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;nbsp;He was touring in the area. &amp;nbsp;We walked backed to the car through Freddies, purchasing coffee and shaving cream.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7201395886937607167'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7201395886937607167'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/05/pycon-looking-back.html' title='Pycon: Looking Back'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7062947771641910229</id><published>2017-05-16T18:54:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2017-05-18T23:23:41.513-07:00</updated><title type='text'>As the World Turns</title><content type='html'>&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7r2qsEfU-s&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Coming back to a certain soap opera, yes, I remember when the president elect said he was completely in support of Flynn talking to Russians. As incoming National Security dude, that was his role, and he was ramping up in a conscientious fashion, as a key player on the transition team.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/russiagate.html&quot;&gt;Pizzagate&lt;/a&gt; got in the way, and Flynn came across as less than fully candid to the Veep, and Trump needed Pence, even more than Flynn, to stay on board. However Trump was forthcoming with the media, which he loathes as we know, that he didn&#39;t think Flynn&#39;s sin arose from his interaction with Russian counterparts. &amp;nbsp;That part was just a future National Security advisor doing his job.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now Trump is accused of being like Flynn, doing what Flynn himself was accused of. &amp;nbsp;The difference: Trump is president. &amp;nbsp;He gets to exercise his own judgement, and that&#39;s precisely where everyone wants to rein him in. &amp;nbsp;As president, he gets a national security team to defend the office. Flynn didn&#39;t have the home court advantage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the plot continues to thicken, everyone needs to second guess this rich uncle who has stumbled into the White House, to everyone&#39;s surprise, and now gets to pull the levers of power. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Democracy means you get a lot of back seat drivers. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However now that we&#39;re an oligarchy (according to many studies), mirroring Russia&#39;s (kleptocratic), those busybody back seaters may be safely ignored, at least for longer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So now, in that light, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/02/rabble-babble.html&quot;&gt;such history now remembered&lt;/a&gt;, we&#39;re hearing from the ex FBI Director that Trump really hoped this was not going to be a witch burning of his friend Flynn. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was right after the sacking. &amp;nbsp;Flynn had already paid a high price, and forfeited a job to which he had been much looking forward. &amp;nbsp;Had he sounded reassuring, even conciliatory on the phone? &amp;nbsp;We wanted more saber rattling? &amp;nbsp;And who are the &quot;we&quot; in this picture?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everything had turned to ashes for the guy already, so why make it worse?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A president is allowed to express (confess?) his loyalty and hopeful feelings, as if to a confidant. Maybe Comey would be that? &amp;nbsp;Too early to know, in those days. &amp;nbsp;He didn&#39;t want to pursue Hillary any further either, despite the large number of jackals in his own camp, happy to do just that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And now, lo these many months later, everyone is looking back at those episodes and thinking, aha, more proof of sneaky connivance, colluding or whatever. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The media hates Trump for all the insults he&#39;s heaped upon them. &amp;nbsp;He&#39;s not at all polite, like Obama was, except we call that being &quot;politically correct&quot; i.e. &quot;civil&quot; which to many ears sounds too insincere to pass muster. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hence Trump&#39;s win in the Electoral College (maybe with a little help from &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/02/the-best-democracy-money-can-buy-movie.html&quot;&gt;voter roll purges&lt;/a&gt;, the FBI is still looking into that right?).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
CNN especially has been the lap dog of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/04/girl-rising-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;monster GRUNCH&lt;/a&gt;, according to these anonymous sources. However we can&#39;t blame that on Ted Turner, an American oligarch, as he&#39;s a founder, not a daily operations guy by 2017. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nor does it make sense to blame Time-Warner, a literally soulless corporation, even if metaphorically &quot;a person&quot;&amp;nbsp;in anthropological literature (aka &quot;voodoo economics&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The soap opera is one of aggrieved parties seeking vengeance, each hoping to do the neighbor in. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s a certain awkwardness about fighting dinosaurs. &amp;nbsp;The ground trembles and it&#39;s all very dramatic. &amp;nbsp;That sells product, especially soap (politics &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/03/wading-around.html&quot;&gt;feels so unclean&lt;/a&gt; sometimes). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The economy cranks ahead, one day at a time, as the world turns.&lt;br /&gt;

The clouds really let loose while I sat looking out the window of &lt;i&gt;Common Grounds&lt;/i&gt;, here on Hawthorne Boulevard, Asylum District, Portland, Oregon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lightning flashed, and the power went out, twice. Thanks to some electrical issue in my Mac Air ‚Äî not the battery ‚Äî a power out entails a reboot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was productive anyway though: I plowed through several lectures on Arduino programming, continuing with the MOOC I&#39;m taking through &lt;i&gt;Coursera&lt;/i&gt;; submitted an invoice for recent work; edited &lt;i&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/i&gt;, adding how Python implements &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application#Implementations&quot;&gt;partial application of arguments&lt;/a&gt; to functions, resulting in new functions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/08/concurrency-again.html&quot;&gt;Fellow Wanderer Dr. DiNucci&lt;/a&gt; is here. I invited him to dinner at &lt;i&gt;Szechuan Chef&lt;/i&gt;, I&#39;m hoping with Alex.  We&#39;re always looking for excuses for Szechuan cuisine, and miss &lt;i&gt;Lucky Strike&lt;/i&gt; being so close by.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Alex confirms that was Yangsi Rinpoche I got to meet at &lt;i&gt;Dwaraka&lt;/i&gt; briefly, back in April. &amp;nbsp;He&#39;s like the headmaster at &lt;i&gt;Maitripa College&lt;/i&gt;, which I visited &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/05/buddhist-ghetto.html&quot;&gt;a week ago&lt;/a&gt; tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I need to get clearer on is how the Arduino IDE uses something like Processing to end up with C. &amp;nbsp;We tend to call Arduino programs &quot;sketches&quot;, the same word Shiffman uses when teaching about vectors, acceleration and forces in his &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/s6b1_3bNCxk&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Coding Train&lt;/i&gt; videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been sharing my enthusiasm for the Shiffman syllabus &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=10148751&quot;&gt;on &lt;i&gt;math-teach&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and also on &lt;i&gt;The Physics Learning Research List&lt;/i&gt;.  He&#39;s one of several Youtube math teachers I consider talented. &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/10/surveying-pedagogy.html&quot;&gt;Eugene Khutoryansky&lt;/a&gt; is another.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I&#39;m likely offending some of the more idolatrous, with this Pastafarian sermon, one might call it, on Synergetics no less. Cinco de Mayo was a productive day for me, in terms of getting out three videos for the &lt;i&gt;Synergetics 200&lt;/i&gt; playlist (on Youtube).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Western Civ at least, the sciences purposely developed a certain edginess with respect to religion, as a matter of asserting a human freedom to speculate.&amp;nbsp; Thinking outside the box may seem a threat to in-the-box thinkers, though more likely they&#39;ll take no notice.&amp;nbsp; I make reference to Descartes&#39; apparent worries, that his discoveries outside the recognized canon of authorities might get him in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. William Martin, whom I also mention in my talk, had just given a cogent lecture the night before, about how cell-based autonomous programmable life forms could have developed on the sea floor and in the crust.&amp;nbsp; He sees the chemistry as hardwired to move in that direction, given the right preconditions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The black smoker type vents were maybe not as prototypical of the earliest RNA World apartment as the undersea vents later discovered and named Lost City by the community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sulfur, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen all play a serious role, with catalyzing metals helping organic reactions flow towards life forms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, scientists would likely find Fuller&#39;s U = MP too much the transcendentalist fantasy, regarding some aspect of being that&#39;s weightless, non-energetic.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve been pretty strict of late about keeping &quot;meta&quot; away from &quot;physical&quot; -- although &quot;metadata&quot; has not been a problem.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Any talk of some &quot;metaphysical&quot; aspect of Universe sounds too ghostly to be a science, to postmodernist ears.&amp;nbsp; All the more reason to usher philosophy back into the picture.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition, Synergetics seems atavistic for its fascination with polyhedrons.&amp;nbsp; Didn&#39;t philosophy outgrow such toys long ago?&amp;nbsp; Many grownups seem to think so.&amp;nbsp; Polyhedrons feature at best in recreational mathematics, as hobbyist devices.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The basic process in Dr. Martin&#39;s view is for cells to break free of their towering infernos, or incubators more accurately, they&#39;d need to incorporate the catalyzing metal function, which is to maintain voltage pressure across a membrane.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Protons (hydrogen ions) want in, driving the ATP generator, ATP Synthase.&amp;nbsp; Those ATP pathways may seem too complex to be that old, but are really no more elaborate than RNA itself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, complexity arises more spontaneously than earlier mathematics seemed to permit.&amp;nbsp; Positive synergy is better understood.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, these narratives are speculative theories, incomplete, and may be wrong, Dr. Martin was up front about that possibility.&amp;nbsp; We cobble together the most credible story we can, given what we have to work with, is the attitude.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What repels these scientists most are those closed, irrefutable dogmatic stories that harbor no self critical counter-intelligence to speak of.&amp;nbsp; Such stories seem too brain dead to be trusted really.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s the freedom to keep saying &quot;we&#39;re not sure yet, lets not pretend we are&quot; that scientists fight for, whereas such &quot;not knowing&quot; may leave others uncomfortable.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Portlandia loses a great Creative with the departure of Melody.&amp;nbsp; She shot away from my place, her last base and former residence, perhaps to wind up in India we don&#39;t know yet.&amp;nbsp; She wouldn&#39;t drive all that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My next expected house guest texted me from seat 20-D what his alternative arrangements were, which make sense&amp;nbsp; (loose ends to attend to -- he used to live in Beaverton), just as the cabin door closed on his flight to Costa Rica was it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, Pycon-related. That&#39;s coming right up, and I&#39;ll get to most of it I expect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of the Python.org &quot;nation&quot; (some people don&#39;t like me calling it that, something to think about before having a &quot;dictator&quot;?), edu-sig is ramping up again, in terms of activity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m by far the most active poster, and I&#39;m happy to have my few haunts, my bat caves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, generous individuals have saved us rekeying the Periodic Table data, by saving it for us, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON&quot;&gt;in JSON format&lt;/a&gt;, workable license (as in free).&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve already updated periodic_table.db on my Github and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thekirbster.pythonanywhere.com/&quot;&gt;live Flask application&lt;/a&gt;, my forty hour Python course a top concern.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also have SQLite tables named glossary.db and maybe polyhedrons.db.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m signed up to give another lecture next week, outside my virtual classroom. I think that will help me speed think my way through some material.&amp;nbsp; I often get a boost out of such performances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not that I think &quot;speed thinking&quot; is always the way to go.&amp;nbsp; Makes my blog posts less readable, some might insist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melody has a plan and is self sufficient in many admirable ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know North Koreans are skeptical that USers are anything but brainwashed, given the craziness they buy into.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My working hypothesis is neural networks still outperform the machine learning ones in many critical-to-us dimensions.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not against pushing work off onto machines though, where applicable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On Facebook I&#39;m looking at whether &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/12/work-study.html&quot;&gt;college as an institution&lt;/a&gt; combined with the loan industry is really viable.&amp;nbsp; We don&#39;t have enough GST going.&amp;nbsp; Still too much Econ, garden variety.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s an analysis many don&#39;t share, but then I never claimed my blogs were anything other than esoteric.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m assuming this &quot;switch&quot; means all my posts to this site to date will be lost, breaking many links.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;If and when that happens, I&#39;ll plan to stop my monthly contribution and never post again to the QuakerQuaker site (nor read it either).&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the webmaster:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
It&#39;s time to move QuakerQuakerEverything&#39;s not quite ready, but it&#39;s time to move QuakerQuaker over to the new server. It will be powered by BuddyPress, a variation on WordPress blogging platform. It&#39;s still very much an experiment in progress, but that&#39;s fitting in with the history of QuakerQuaker. I&#39;ve announced some of the changes on a blog post there:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://quakerquaker.martinkelley.com/2017/04/time-switch-quakerquaker/&quot;&gt;Time to switch QuakerQuaker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the switch happens that site will become QuakerQuaker.org and this will be temporarily Ning.com/quakerquaker until I close it down. Please send all feedback as comments on the new site. I&#39;ll be traveling on a family vacation soon and not as available on email. Having everything at one spot will help! &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, as I say there, the Paypal account is currently about $30 short (and the vacation means I can&#39;t front any myself this month). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.paypal.me/martinkelley&quot;&gt;You can use the PaypalMe account to help out&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks in advance. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
‚ÄîMartin for QuakerQuaker. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xe1qWteeEhk&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
Andy Warhol fans and detractors already know this story. I was only 
glancingly familiar with most of his work until recently, when Portland 
Art Museum unveiled &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/01/andy-warhol-exhibit.html&quot;&gt;a major retrospective&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; That helped me tune in more 
of his scene, though I didn&#39;t catch the name Edie Sedgwick until last 
night, when I finally saw the dramatization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My 
thoughts flashed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/neverland-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Patty Hearst&lt;/a&gt; a few times, and her relationship with
 her own family. I&#39;m not a know-it-all on these families, just we have a
 lot of windows and telling remarks in the public record, which 
facilitates discussion of celebrities.&amp;nbsp; Orson Welles comes to mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edie
 was an heiress from a Santa Barbara ranch family, transplants from 
Boston, East Coasters on the Pacific. Hearst Castle is on the same 
coast.&amp;nbsp; When I think of Hearst, I often flash on &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/12/toontown-revisited.html&quot;&gt;Homer Davenport&lt;/a&gt;, his 
lead political cartoonist in some chapters, and native of Silverton, 
Oregon.&amp;nbsp; I have quite a bit about Homer in my blogs owing to my 
friendship &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/04/digital-scanning.html&quot;&gt;with Gus Frederick&lt;/a&gt;, an expert on Homer&#39;s life and to some 
extent times.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edie&#39;s big dream was to find herself in 
New York and to pioneer a freer way of being alive in a city big enough 
hearted to support such experiments.&amp;nbsp; She was by all accounts bold, but 
in falling victim to drug abuse, got derailed.&amp;nbsp; This was the story of a 
generation and has not ceased being the core plot of many scenarios.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Folks
 in my cohort have their own generational window in that I was old 
enough to have Warhol on my radar, but not adult enough to track the 
soap operas.&amp;nbsp; I uncover the history of my own time in my later years, 
having lived through it in my own day dreamy way, as some kid in Italy 
or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of work went into making this a real telling. The filmmakers undertake their task seriously. I&#39;m &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/mishima-life-in-four-chapters-movie.html&quot;&gt;reminded of &lt;i&gt;Mishima&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In being a dramatization, the script takes many &lt;a href=&quot;http://edieempire.livejournal.com/1026.html&quot;&gt;liberties with the facts&lt;/a&gt;, many of which remain unknown. This movie is but one possible assembly of an intricate jigsaw puzzle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
My two students will get some overview about how it all fits together. &amp;nbsp;Here&#39;s what I have in Movement:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/33146648244/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;codepen&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;codepen&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2882/33146648244_fe7ecfa547.jpg&quot; width=&quot;478&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, JavaScript (ES, JS), a moving target of a language. A front line. I&#39;m impressed by the many troopers who march into Angular, React and all that. The tutorials look fun. &amp;nbsp;Yet I&#39;m still busy boning up on Python. &amp;nbsp;JS is back burner for me, so not the front end developer in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Eating my own dogfood&quot; is a geek expression which, loosely translated, means walking one&#39;s talk. If I&#39;m out there talking code schools, Silk Road or otherwise, I need to be putting in my hours, though not completely at the expense of exercise. &amp;nbsp;I did make it up Mt. Tabor today. &amp;nbsp;Rain was threatening, so I had my hat. &amp;nbsp;David DiNucci (computer scientist) happened to be walking in the same direction and joined us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melody was by today, in part to return Naga, the stuffed snake Steve Holden brought into circulation around the time toy animal mascots were seen as cool, a sign of not taking ourselves too seriously. Perl started it with the Camel, and then O&#39;Reilly gave us the animal books.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/albums/72157678956896774&quot; title=&quot;Women as Kings&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/3944/33503021280_80c72498d3_w.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;Women as Kings&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I&#39;ve chosen this title precisely because it&#39;s a gender bender, as we normally translate &quot;King&quot; to mean &quot;of the male gender&quot; and so &quot;women as Kings&quot; is an oxymoron, a grammatical error?&amp;nbsp; Why so though? Kara Cooney was interested in precisely that question.&amp;nbsp; In ancient Egypt, a woman would occasionally become Pharaoh.&amp;nbsp; How and why?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The timing of the talk was ironic in that pyramid-hierarchies run by men were clearly wreaking havoc, cranking up military invasion plans long in the making, and triggered by magic trick (not good magic, evildoers at work).&amp;nbsp; Women are not really represented in world affairs and are expected to go along as cheerleaders and care-providers, but why so?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kara&#39;s hypotheses are in the direction of raw biological facts of life. Bearing a child puts huge stress on a woman, and that&#39;s just the beginning of her caretaker role.&amp;nbsp; Men, unencumbered by pregnancy or nursing offspring, range far from the camp, in hunter-gatherer tribes, and fetch the hard to find, treasured meat protein.&amp;nbsp; They literally bring home the bacon, which serves as a currency, cementing inter-family relationships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In societies were getting the valued protein is something both sexes engage in, such as by fishing in the American southwest, women are more likely to sit on councils of elders and weigh in on the big decisions.&amp;nbsp; Where all the whale meat comes from men, women have little leverage and are treated more like livestock. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once we&#39;re into an agricultural society, women still do most of the clothes-making and janitorial work. They&#39;re expected to have even more kids per year than in hunter-gatherer societies. Again, biology is against their achieving leadership roles.&amp;nbsp; Men are more likely to survive, in not undergoing childbirth, though they may fall in war.&amp;nbsp; Life spans weren&#39;t as long across the board.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now let&#39;s turn to Egypt and what made her special:&amp;nbsp; an ocean for a northern border, desert on three sides, and granite boulders in the upper Nile.&amp;nbsp; Large scale military invasions were pretty much out of the question, and the fertile river valley produced just about everything a civilization might need.&amp;nbsp; By dint of geography, Egypt was both abundant and well-protected.&amp;nbsp; In such a society, patterns could settle, through thirty dynasties, until she became more of an annex to Rome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The main focus of Kara&#39;s talk was Hatshepsut. Dr. Cooney (UCLA) is an expert in Egyptian sarcophagi and knows her Egyptology really well. Her book, &lt;i&gt;Women Who Would Be King&lt;/i&gt;, is on what allowed women to rise to the highest, most divine position in the land, beginning with explanations for why the occurrence was nevertheless uncommon, and still is to this day (not that we have pharaohs anymore).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hatshepsut had a perfect pedigree, as a king&#39;s daughter who married a king.&amp;nbsp; When the king she was married to died, without leaving a son, succession switched to her nephew. She was permitted to act as regent as the nephew grew into adulthood, and even then, she served as co-king.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some decades after she died and was given a king&#39;s tomb, the nephew went to some lengths to have her memory expunged.&amp;nbsp; Archeologists are still putting the story together, understanding how temporal powers, even more than acts of nature, tend to mess with the record.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cleopatra, Nefertiti, and some other female pharaohs made her list.&amp;nbsp; She was respectful of all of them, but pointed out the pattern:&amp;nbsp; none of them ruled solo, all were apparently tolerated in order to provide a placeholder and smooth a transition to some new lineage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the brute facts of biology, Kara thinks women are perceived as loyal within a narrower, smaller sphere, the family or tribe, whereas men get to be the power brokers in the greater games. The public is more suspicious, almost instinctively, of a woman&#39;s loyalties and motives.&amp;nbsp; Men get more benefit of the doubt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Q&amp;amp;A was lively, and at the dinner downstairs, Kara kept the conversation going well through the dinner hour.&amp;nbsp; People gathered from all tables and shared viewpoints late into the night.&amp;nbsp; That was evidence of Kara&#39;s power and leadership right there.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s a powerful presenter, and charming as well, in being so forthright.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I wonder, as a Quaker, is if women come into their own in power structures that have no obvious hierarchy, are less pyramidal and more networked.&amp;nbsp; I think of switchboard operators, a passing profession.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m glad Christine got her truck back.&amp;nbsp; She drove me home, telling me the story.&amp;nbsp; The truck had been stolen right out from under her.&amp;nbsp; Except for the smell, it was undamaged, even came with some extra tools. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot; trbidi=&quot;on&quot;&gt;
I&#39;m deliberately not setting some super high bar, in terms of production values, keeping my focus on the story. People tolerate a crude stage and hand puppets if they have some respect for the content, and I don&#39;t even have hand puppets in these.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of content, my work is easy: I&#39;m presenting the work of an established genius. The respect factor is already high, the relevant work already published, its authors already highly decorated (Applewhite in his own way). We&#39;ve got the &lt;i&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/i&gt; entry. &lt;i&gt;Britannica&lt;/i&gt; will need to catch up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Random high schoolers, especially numberphiles, will stumble across these and a few will watch the whole series, &lt;i&gt;Synergetics 101&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; As of this writing, that&#39;s the only playlist I&#39;m done with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having taught Python live, on-line quite a bit, I&#39;m able to get these out in single takes, but not without complete do-overs. I&#39;ve also caught some mistakes, which I rectify with annotations rather than overdub or rerecord. Mistakes happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As of March-April 2017, I&#39;m pretty much the only Youtuber presenting straight Synergetics, although even here I&#39;m sneaking in some results and discoveries that came after the publication of the two volumes, as the field has not been dormant since Fuller died in 1983.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets see if others realize this material is accessible, especially with colorful models and constructions, animations. Higher production values are well within range of teachers better endowed than myself, in many ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
