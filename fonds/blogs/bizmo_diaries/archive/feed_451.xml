One of my presents, for my sixtieth birthday, was some workshops at the Process Work Institute in northwest Portland.&amp;nbsp; The details of what goes on in some of the sessions is confidential, but I think it&#39;s safe to say that citizen diplomacy is a theme, even if we don&#39;t call it that.&amp;nbsp; Arny (Arnold Mindell) calls his process Deep Democracy.&amp;nbsp; Students connect from all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tweeted up a storm as I was riding buses 75 and 15 to the venue.&amp;nbsp; The Global Matrix meeting at Glenn&#39;s pad had featured beer and pizza (Nirel was doing watermelon), and with some minutes to spare I dropped into a very local yokel joint on W Burnside, the opposite of upscale fancy, for a low cost &lt;i&gt;Rainier&lt;/i&gt;, tallboy can.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The upshot is I was somewhat relaxed and sleepy at the workshop, which is not all together inappropriate given the emphasis on staying in a day dreamy state even while navigating in CR (consensus reality).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tourism gets a rep for being purely recreational, even though travel is a form of work.&amp;nbsp; People come to Portland from all over the world to pursue their careers, but that may count as &quot;tourism&quot; if there&#39;s no obvious business paying expenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When soldiers do their tours, in the line of duty, that&#39;s not considered tourism either.&amp;nbsp; How about when our family went to the Parliament of World Religions in Cape Town, and my wife did a workshop with the Dalai Lama in Durban?&amp;nbsp; Was that tourism then?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Someone from Cape Town was in our car going back to Asylum District.&amp;nbsp; This was her first time at PWI, but she wasn&#39;t new to process work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The reason I ask is because citizen diplomacy is exponentially more doable given telecommuting and given businesses have as a part of their agenda a commitment to team building and staffers getting along.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;melting pot&quot; may not be a zip code so much as a virtual space in Cyberia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Choreography matters.&amp;nbsp; People want to see big organized dances, be those military parades or the Olympics.&amp;nbsp; We become persuaded of our ability to synchronize, as a species.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s political capital for other ventures.&amp;nbsp; Or psychological energy, depending on your shoptalk (vocabulary, namespace).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Another signal we cell phone users get daily, regarding the demise of FDR style socialism, is that cowardly capitalism is able to bombard us with robocalls unfettered and unregulated by any Big Brother.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m sure the Business Plot Congress (named in honor of the Business Plot) is pleased with this outcome, as it means scammers (their sponsors) have free rein to attack their constituents (their victims).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As someone relatively tech savvy, I downloaded an app from Sweden that says &quot;insurance scam&quot; every time a robocall tries to sell me Blue Cross.&amp;nbsp; The reputation of Blue Cross, like that of the White Helmets, is tainted and diminished by this degrading format.&amp;nbsp; We in Cyberia simply associate &quot;health insurance&quot; with &quot;scam&quot; after a few hundred such robocalls.&amp;nbsp; They still fill my inbox with their robot messages.&amp;nbsp; I have to go in and clean it out. Added drudgery.&amp;nbsp; Thanks Congress!&amp;nbsp; Thanks FBI!&amp;nbsp; Do I sound sarcastic?&amp;nbsp; Maybe not, as here&#39;s a fast way to signal the diminishing power and influence of already broken institutions.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Too big to fail&quot;?&amp;nbsp; What about &quot;too late to fix&quot;?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3lV_Rf2E0BCKLtWj6J1ei2pE1DuBH8bXIbusxXFer5OByxTmrSqS9vSzZPegMKBmJ0crztnOiLl5Viz-46MMAqKGeK8UZhuH1BTD9_SEPcfixM1V_Nr8NbPUD41RtZUvolSk1/s1600/geopandas_success.tiff&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;675&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj3lV_Rf2E0BCKLtWj6J1ei2pE1DuBH8bXIbusxXFer5OByxTmrSqS9vSzZPegMKBmJ0crztnOiLl5Viz-46MMAqKGeK8UZhuH1BTD9_SEPcfixM1V_Nr8NbPUD41RtZUvolSk1/s400/geopandas_success.tiff&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
:: &lt;i&gt;success!&lt;/i&gt; ::&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I discovered the hard way today that blithely installing &lt;a href=&quot;http://geopandas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&quot;&gt;geopandas&lt;/a&gt; from the conda-forge repo, &lt;i&gt;atop a default repo version&lt;/i&gt;, is not a tastey recipe. I had to toss my original default Anaconda out the window and do a clean install, good exercise, but not how I&#39;d anticipated events flowing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following best practice, I&#39;m now installing a geopandas in its own environment.&amp;nbsp; But do I have the repo issue sorted out?&amp;nbsp; After this fresh install from the Anaconda website, I went [&lt;i&gt;Warning&lt;/i&gt;:&amp;nbsp; don&#39;t do this, read on!]:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;$ conda create --name geopandas python=3.6 geopandas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
leaving it entirely up to conda to decide which repo I meant.&amp;nbsp; Even I don&#39;t know, but there&#39;s Fiona and all the rest, so I know I&#39;m getting some gigabytes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upgrading the Anaconda navigator (in process) will give it a chance to see the new environment I just created.&amp;nbsp; Will geopandas import successfully this time, or crap out in Fiona?&amp;nbsp; That is the question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re going from Anaconda 1.7.0 to 1.8.5 -- OK, done, lets see if we have a new environment, yes I do, and I don&#39;t even have Spyder 3.2.8 yet, in the new one.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll go out to the command line, activate the new environment, boot python, and see if the import works, take a screenshot...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Not so fast, say the conda gods. I still have PATH issues.&amp;nbsp; Fight, fight, fight!&amp;nbsp; &quot;Fighting Quakers&quot; is a meme, cite Earlham College, also Franklin High School here in Portland, just blocks away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/27153082297/in/photolist-HnqDnk-F7Udph-pxkvi7-axj4op/&quot; title=&quot;Caution: Fighting Quakers Ahead&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Caution: Fighting Quakers Ahead&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/962/27153082297_e32d426424.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However Franklin High School recently&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/national/article211108734.html&quot;&gt;dropped the Fighting Quaker mascot&lt;/a&gt; recently using the rationale of not wanting to offend Friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Friends I know were forgiving as it&#39;s true Ben Franklin never overtly tied himself through membership to any Meeting, that we&#39;re able to find the record of.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoQm7feCJrl-wxNKihZkNacxD27nUk28VtiYR-0VHkROLoa7Bcad4XRwUnM5TJfOsT1kyRqTVEk-wyJTfbewILmwsdTcis8UryBP6fuKttwJ6i3dGjg-3GBPgArTY8ohma_Owh/s1600/geopandas_waste_of_time_2018.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;675&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoQm7feCJrl-wxNKihZkNacxD27nUk28VtiYR-0VHkROLoa7Bcad4XRwUnM5TJfOsT1kyRqTVEk-wyJTfbewILmwsdTcis8UryBP6fuKttwJ6i3dGjg-3GBPgArTY8ohma_Owh/s400/geopandas_waste_of_time_2018.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So no, even with a clean environment, without a force to conda-forge as the repo, don&#39;t expect a working geopandas.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, there&#39;s a one liner to wipe an Environment.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll do that, after some coffee (looks like a late nighter), then do a conda install of geopandas with conda-forge the forced repo.&amp;nbsp; Can one set a default repo &lt;a href=&quot;https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html&quot;&gt;per each Environment&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Skipped the coffee, &lt;a href=&quot;https://conda.io/docs/commands/env/conda-env-remove.html&quot;&gt;bashed on&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Then took a break.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good thing I did as the pinto beans were done, just in time to turn off the crockpot.&amp;nbsp; Reheat some coffee in the microwave.&amp;nbsp; So where are we?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Navigator sees its environment is gone.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll recreate geopandas and then install with a -c conda-forge, meaning I specify the channel and don&#39;t leave it up to conda to decide.&amp;nbsp; Will that go any better?&amp;nbsp; Lets find out:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;
p.p1 {margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 22.0px Menlo}
span.s1 {font-variant-ligatures: no-common-ligatures}
&lt;/style&gt;


&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;p1&quot;&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace; font-size: small;&quot;&gt;conda create -n geopandas python=3.6 geopandas -c conda-forge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That gets me:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj48Na9drlJOPBZ44cGT1ICsHnhl6GtmaCYQoscIurQGCcc7IdY_fK97mnveuRjB-mwAjY9xPdgYvgX5ATPY3MtLCMqbbwjCmKVZYNl15pevUk0GCHQDGlcre91U4LBZPSgkNfe/s1600/conda-forge-install-geopandas.tiff&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;675&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1050&quot; height=&quot;256&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj48Na9drlJOPBZ44cGT1ICsHnhl6GtmaCYQoscIurQGCcc7IdY_fK97mnveuRjB-mwAjY9xPdgYvgX5ATPY3MtLCMqbbwjCmKVZYNl15pevUk0GCHQDGlcre91U4LBZPSgkNfe/s400/conda-forge-install-geopandas.tiff&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s looking promising.&amp;nbsp; Will fiona slay me again?&amp;nbsp; Lets proceed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to the way operating systems facilitate multitasking, I&#39;m able to turn my attention to other matters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earlier today, the FBI was asking small business owners in the USSA (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/02/rabble-babble.html&quot;&gt;inside joke&lt;/a&gt;) to at least reboot their routers if not install actual firmware.&amp;nbsp; The Disney Parental Circle option has been added for the Netgear R7000, I discovered, upon fully complying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don&#39;t question Big Brother, right?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m sure many Russians will be equally interested in obeying, as no one wants malware on their routers, whatever the source.&amp;nbsp; Here&#39;s a screen shot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzEwFhZuZ5ni9fNJ7v8xiQm0LT0VDc-w7JCoxoolMCRIvjxXgq6wEwAMwoSOWAxhSOpdI_mz67UaJD6DMVJOr_drVYFtATQWhe3mY6gj_6jJQS2TVZkTmQ1LhiLOqjp79hxLbj/s1600/netgear_parental_circle.tiff&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;548&quot; data-original-width=&quot;606&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzEwFhZuZ5ni9fNJ7v8xiQm0LT0VDc-w7JCoxoolMCRIvjxXgq6wEwAMwoSOWAxhSOpdI_mz67UaJD6DMVJOr_drVYFtATQWhe3mY6gj_6jJQS2TVZkTmQ1LhiLOqjp79hxLbj/s400/netgear_parental_circle.tiff&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s after hacking in to the Netgear on 192.168.0.1 I think it was, which is actually the router behind the router facing the public internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This all came after my exploring the geopandas possibility earlier this Saturday.&amp;nbsp; Yes I often work on the weekends, entrepreneur that I am.&amp;nbsp; Do I keep the sabbath?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d welcome a conversation with rabbis about that sometime.&amp;nbsp; Netiquette has a lot in common with Jewish law?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not the authority.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m still installing in another process.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve put a lot of hours into spatial data management today, what with the summit meeting in Cedarhurst.&amp;nbsp; I should update the CTO.&amp;nbsp; Damn, too much on my plate!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m gonna get another bowl of beans and salsa and write to the NetDispenser group.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s open source and uses the Raspberry Pi as a router, which is what I want to ask about.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll check on my &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;geopandas&lt;/span&gt; experiment in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All right!&amp;nbsp; I document my success with the top screen shot.&amp;nbsp; A &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;courier new&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;courier&amp;quot; , monospace;&quot;&gt;-c conda-forge&lt;/span&gt; on the end kept the Environment integral.&amp;nbsp; Compatibility was achieved!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Surprising how little discussion of a global grid we&#39;ve seen in the 21st Century, in light of Peak Oil.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Historians will write:&amp;nbsp; The building of a global grid at the beginning of the 21st Century was one of the key elements in the rise of the prosperity of the civilization that we know today.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The video below pointedly skips showing the most lobbied-for grid I&#39;m aware of:  Alaska to Siberia, for inter-hemispheric transmission.&amp;nbsp; I left a comment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The main cause for skepticism?&amp;nbsp; That humans are unable to get along.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s kind of the point.&amp;nbsp; Global grid talk is for grownups, not for TV viewers trapped in their mostly-fiction media bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/b1HWNcLDK88&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I watched the whole thing, after a rather grueling data science class. Like I&#39;d developed my Jupyter Notebooks using pandas 0.23 but left the teaching computer at 0.22 -- that was part of it.&amp;nbsp; The differences were subtle but when a demo doesn&#39;t work, I have to flounder and find out later what went wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We were done by 10:30 PM and I started into Youtubes.&amp;nbsp; Now it&#39;s almost 4 AM.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PBS has a huge number of hours on Putin I see.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m never going to have time for them all, but I&#39;m glad I watched this one.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve sampled others as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s a little bit self-contradictory, not what I&#39;d call unbiased, but this is &lt;i&gt;Frontline&lt;/i&gt;, so we know it&#39;s leaving it to viewers like me to draw our own conclusions, which may be different from those of &lt;i&gt;Frontline&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Free country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a veteran &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/11/occupy-unmasked-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;of Portland Occupy&lt;/a&gt;, I know these youthful movements to take over squares were indeed somewhat organic (I wasn&#39;t paid) and they occurred in North America as well.&amp;nbsp; The entrenched political sphere does not go unchallenged.&amp;nbsp; Oligarchs are everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the contradictions is she accuses the Kremlin of paranoia regarding paid protestors, then tells a story of protestors getting paid.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Julia confesses she goes cross-eyed when it comes to cyber stuff, but a few minutes later turns out to be something of an authority on Russian hacking.&amp;nbsp; As of today, there&#39;s still a lot of speculation about the Fancy Bear stuff.&amp;nbsp; I see no reason to speak with such certainty.&amp;nbsp; Yes, we all have theories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s illegal about Russians using Facebook anyway?&amp;nbsp; But that&#39;s a different story from what&#39;s in the DNI report, which is not about Cambridge Analytica and UK meddling either.&amp;nbsp; Pretty selective.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Kremlin doesn&#39;t believe in organic protests, Julia says, but then the protests against fracking in the west show all the signs of the conveyor belt turning the other way, i.e. the invisible hand of Moscow is behind the anti-fracking astroturf.&amp;nbsp; So we agree there&#39;s astroturf.&amp;nbsp; What happened to &quot;organic&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks to Oliver Stone for contributing as much to any &quot;Putin files&quot; as &lt;i&gt;Frontline&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; lineup.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Americans love revolutions Julia tells us, because theirs was a success.&amp;nbsp; And democracy.&amp;nbsp; The line that all these wars in Iraq, Syria, Libya (undermining Allende, imposing the Shah...) and so on are motivated by purely &quot;good guy&quot; ideals makes for an ideological simplification and rather one dimensional storyline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But here&#39;s Frontline sitting at her feet, lapping it up, no tough questions, as that&#39;s not what this is about.&amp;nbsp; The interviewers are mainly there as fans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets hope they&#39;re doing at least as many hours on someone domestic. Taking shots at foreign leaders is fun, but there&#39;s more to being PBS than that we hope.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But wait, Congress is always threatening to pull funding.&amp;nbsp; PBS is more like RT than CNN in that regard, an arm of the government.&amp;nbsp; Youtube says so right under the video, with a link to Wikipedia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Putin Files is more likely to endear PBS to Congress, which needs its old enemies to stay sane.&amp;nbsp; Not much GENI talk around DC these days, quite the backwater (aka swamp).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s fun about this interview is Julia actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/04/the-americans-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;mentions &lt;i&gt;The Americans&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which I&#39;ve been watching recently.&amp;nbsp; Where science fiction ends and reality begins is always hazy in this world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me on Facebook:&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Interesting interview, long. &lt;i&gt; Frontline&lt;/i&gt; has hours and hours in its Putin Files.  Her dad grew up in Moscow. Julia has a somewhat simplistic good versus evil worldview.  Americans 
are idealistic and just want to spread democracy, making the world a 
better place.  Putin will never understand will he?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
We can &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/05/on-projection.html&quot;&gt;project on Putin&lt;/a&gt; all we like, claiming he&#39;s influenced by his background in 
spydom, but how are we not all in that world at this point?&amp;nbsp; 
&quot;Intelligence&quot; is a very generic term and it&#39;s not all about being a next 
Einstein (who was spied on).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paranoia is not something specifically 
Russian, duh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Welcome to the noosphere then.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When do we get to talk about telepathy?&amp;nbsp; Not on this show.&amp;nbsp; Switch to Esalen?&amp;nbsp; Tell us more about how the hippies helped save physics maybe?&lt;/div&gt;

Time passes more quickly now, and not just because I&#39;m getting older.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Accelerating acceleration is what Alvin Toffler warned us about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Events of just a few years ago are already vintage, like old black &amp;amp; white pictures from ages gone by.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That scruffy looking box in the back, leaning up against the fence (behind the C6XTY) contained a gazebo, coated steel frame, 10 by 10 feet when assembled (how tall?).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I finally passed in on to a young couple with kids.&amp;nbsp; The mom came and got in her pickup truck.&amp;nbsp; Freecycle works. &lt;/div&gt;

A milestone for sure.&amp;nbsp; I almost didn&#39;t make it given &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/01/health-plan.html&quot;&gt;how the year began&lt;/a&gt;, with a sudden hospitalization. We tend to meditate on such things, as the odometer turns.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m a working dude, not a big income.&amp;nbsp; Python teachers like me operate in the &quot;gig economy&quot; meaning without health insurance but for Oregon&#39;s.&amp;nbsp; Plus I do a lot more than teach this computer language.&amp;nbsp; I get to be one of the Wanderers and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn Stockton was by this morning, starting work on his Global Matrix website (&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2017/04/portland-design-week-2017.html&quot;&gt;think &quot;hexapents&quot;&lt;/a&gt;), having gained a new sponsor. I&#39;ve been typing up his letter of introduction, for a packet he&#39;s mailing, to a new contact.&amp;nbsp; The sponsor is someone he already knows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right now I&#39;m cooking with wonderful leftovers that Melody prepared during her all too brief recent stint here in Portland.&amp;nbsp; She left Carol&#39;s room in great shape.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s my mom, 89.&amp;nbsp; Dad died in 2000 in a car accident in South Africa.&amp;nbsp; Carol was with him and gravely injured, but stayed with us and bounced back.&amp;nbsp; We had a great time as a family, living all over the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some hours from now, I&#39;ll be launching into one of my night school gigs, bringing another cohort of Python programmers up to speed.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m also working on a Rhino project.&amp;nbsp; The Mac version of Rhino is quite a ways behind the Windows version, and I&#39;ve never heard talk of a Linux version.&amp;nbsp; For what I&#39;m doing these days, this version of OSX is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m blessed with friends (also Friends) and family.&amp;nbsp; The planet is still a nightmare, in the human realm at least.&amp;nbsp; The idea that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/05/engineering-as-moral-enterprise.html&quot;&gt;Engineers&lt;/a&gt;, not only Priests, Nuns or Psychologists, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/05/philosophy-circles.html&quot;&gt;or Philosophers&lt;/a&gt;, might have a big role to play, in improving matters, is one of those themes the Wanderers are into.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I suppose I&#39;m more a Philosopher than an Engineer, but I do see the relevance of artifacts, logistics, workflows, to the whole business.&amp;nbsp; Economics is becoming more engineering-minded, and I think that&#39;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A stronger science is not &quot;at the expense&quot; of mature religion.&amp;nbsp; That being said, not all religious sub-denominations have much of a half-life, unless they keep morphing in response to continuing revelation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, back to eating and getting on with my work.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll visit Rosalie and whomever shows up at El Mercado [ he wrote after the fact ].&amp;nbsp; Thanks for the TrimTab T-shirt!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/42107444461/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;5 x 2 = 10&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;5 x 2 = 10&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/830/42107444461_d299ff6aed.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Earthians (Earthlings) start with a square, subdivided into a grid, and show multiplication as a matter of slicing out rectangles, n x m.&amp;nbsp; Martians, in contrast, start with an equilateral triangle, subdivided into a grid, and show multiplication as a matter of slicing out triangles, also n x m.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The above triangle, in two shades of green, represents 2 x 6 = 12 i.e. the area of the triangle under the red line is equal to that of 12 grid triangles, shown in tan with green borders.&amp;nbsp; If you mentally swivel the lighter green obtuse triangle about a vertex shared in common with a second such area, you may see how the result fills exactly 4 unit triangles.&amp;nbsp; Light green (4) + dark green (8) = 12.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now lets add another edge from the common origin and multiply three numbers instead of two.&amp;nbsp; Below we see what a volume of 2 x 2 x 5 = 20 might look like.&amp;nbsp; Of course any number of tetrahedrons may have the same volume.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Multiplying inside the IVM, the way Martians do it,&amp;nbsp; provides a canonical OABC for any OA x OB x OC.&amp;nbsp; ABC is &quot;the lid&quot; and simply &quot;closing the lid&quot; is all it takes to define the corresponding volume.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Uncle Bill, 93, bopped down on Amtrak again today.&amp;nbsp; He 
only left himself two hours, which sounds like plenty of time to &quot;bend 
an elbow&quot; as he puts it (have a beer with his grand nephew), but when 
you subtract all the driving to and from... too ambitious.&amp;nbsp; He missed 
his &lt;i&gt;Coast Starlight&lt;/i&gt; going back and took a &lt;i&gt;Cascades&lt;/i&gt; instead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The
 former (&lt;i&gt;Coast Starlight&lt;/i&gt;) is the double-decker that goes from Vancouver 
BC all the way to San Diego.&amp;nbsp; As a younger family, we got to ride in the
 sleeper once, from Union Station (Portland) to San Diego and back.&amp;nbsp; A gift from my mom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The latter 
(&lt;i&gt;Cascades&lt;/i&gt;) is a different design, built to go faster, but Americans are 
having trouble with their infrastructure, as they exhaust their 
resources on adventures abroad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Americans could have an
 amazingly fun set of tourist routes, where the point is the trip as 
much as the destination.&amp;nbsp; But infrastructure takes money and the public 
sector doesn&#39;t have any.&amp;nbsp; Private enterprise backs the war effort, 
filling the void.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A lot of us miss the old USA of course.&amp;nbsp; RIP Uncle 
Sam.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhErlj-mdDxYsmMEgjwuBiz1BOZxA6ygycnQKaIZzX5-MPuFphLchybew5JK7iD4PD1xdsUkhzt5hnBXSUdiiIDDH62N_P1tXpoV9ivGFBAHM2BE9Uc14taLn10GohowzFe3_VB/s1600/cartoon2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;982&quot; data-original-width=&quot;522&quot; height=&quot;640&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhErlj-mdDxYsmMEgjwuBiz1BOZxA6ygycnQKaIZzX5-MPuFphLchybew5JK7iD4PD1xdsUkhzt5hnBXSUdiiIDDH62N_P1tXpoV9ivGFBAHM2BE9Uc14taLn10GohowzFe3_VB/s640/cartoon2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;339&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As my long time blog readers know, I don&#39;t believe the Persians are hellbent on getting nuclear weapons.&amp;nbsp; On the contrary, the political rhetoric coming from these religious leaders as that holding such WMDs is highly immoral and unethical.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The US Christians don&#39;t usually say that.&amp;nbsp; Evangelicals tend to be pro atom bomb, as an expression of God&#39;s love for them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Protestants are especially bomb crazed and explosive ordnance, along with horror films, are principal exports of those infecting the urban areas, District of Columbia especially.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Loving the bomb is right up there with meth and heroine addiction, or addiction to an especially reprobate form of kinky porn.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not in the DSM, but it should be, as a possibly treatable mental illness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A typical symptom of severe mental illness is uncontrolled projection.&amp;nbsp; If you secretly lust after so-and-so, then it may seem everyone around you is driven by similar secrets.&amp;nbsp; The lust for nuclear weapons becomes universal, in the mind of one who&#39;s been taken over by the meme virus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s what I see happening vis-a-vis the Persians (I don&#39;t say Iran because I&#39;m not a big believer in UK imperial globes and their hastily drawn districts, silly anthems and flags, and nutty alliances between their &quot;royal&quot; spoiled families).&amp;nbsp; The nuke heads can&#39;t imagine losing the moral high ground, and compensate by playing king of the hill as they wallow in their addiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#39;t have nuclear weapons, never have.&amp;nbsp; I came to Nuthouse Earth in 1958 and found it to be a place of great potential, but fearful idiot warmongers have been making this place a hell the whole time I&#39;ve been here.&amp;nbsp; I get it.&amp;nbsp; The species is deeply flawed.&amp;nbsp; Great religions have worked to address these flaws, with some success, but there&#39;s a ways to go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, human nature may not be the core problem.&amp;nbsp; Growing pains entail many changes and that&#39;s why we need finite life spans, so that humans replace themselves with humans able to come to grips with the new realities, whatever these may be.&amp;nbsp; Even if there&#39;s reincarnation, we get to shed a lot of the debilitating beliefs we build up over the course of a lifetime.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s that reset button, for back to factory settings, with true learnings collectively preserved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In our time, the UN General Assembly has bypassed the UN Security Council and come up with its own treaty banning nuclear weapons.&amp;nbsp; Of course the nuke heads are against this treaty, but they&#39;re dying of aging and making last gasps.&amp;nbsp; The youth are more realistic and understand their careers as weapons inspectors and environmental cleanup agents are beaconing.&amp;nbsp; Dealing with messes the nuke heads made is already full time work for many people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Iran (there, I said it, when in Rome...) has much more to gain than to lose by choosing the moral high ground and helping the world rid itself of weapons of mass suicide.&amp;nbsp; The Iranian religious leaders have embraced the UN Ban Treaty and proposed the whole region be nuclear free.&amp;nbsp; The whole globe, one would hope, would move in that direction, as a matter of religious faith and respect for whatever deity or deities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the religious nature of Iran&#39;s anti-nuke weapon position, discovering a secret program such as others, suffering from their horrendous addiction, have no choice but to imagine, would be especially devastating psychologically.&amp;nbsp; Such hypocrisy would be hard to fathom.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s like when gay bashing pulpit imams are found guilty of gay affairs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A much more promising approach is for Iran to continue growing its alliances within the anti nuke weapon network, which includes the mayors of most cities.&amp;nbsp; Portland and Tehran are on the same page for example.&amp;nbsp; Oregon likewise suffers under sanctions from the dinosaur Federales and their military junta dictatorship.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re friends with Iran.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What we want to stop is all the ethnic warring, deliberately inflamed by so-called special operators who make it their business to sew discord and distribute outward weapons.&amp;nbsp; Some of these operators pretend to be working on behalf of some &quot;intelligence&quot; agency but we&#39;ve exposed that form of corruption many times.&amp;nbsp; Any drug dealer and half-wit criminal can come on TV or Youtube saying they work for the CIA.&amp;nbsp; Some of these people then get paying jobs working in media.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember, anyone who says &quot;our nuclear weapons&quot; or &quot;when we bombed Japan&quot; is likely an arm of some &quot;we&quot; that no longer has integrity or legitimacy.&amp;nbsp; These people need treatment, medical care, and are not ready for responsible offices or important duties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, I don&#39;t want to promote ageism by saying older people can&#39;t continue to upgrade their thinking.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what American Transcendentalism is all about, what with its mind / brain distinction and focus on divine grace (intuition, Holy Spirit, zeitgeist).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your heritage as a human is to have access to continuing revelation.&amp;nbsp; So if you&#39;re already older than thirty, hang in there and remember to pray for wisdom.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t end up like the walking dead.&amp;nbsp; Become reborn, over and over.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I get these analysts hinting I should see them as part of Capitalism&#39;s Invisible Army, but then I have my own litmus tests.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Are you familiar with &lt;i&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;&amp;nbsp; Thom Hartmann uses an epigram from that book in his &lt;i&gt;Unequal Protection&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s had a show on RT off and on, lives in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also &quot;do you know how to use Jupyter Notebooks?&quot;&amp;nbsp; As an analyst, I&#39;d expect at least that much literacy.&amp;nbsp; Especially among the new hires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ve got a lot of old farts running around pretending to be &quot;intelligence professionals&quot; but in many cases I see no tell tale sign this is the case.&amp;nbsp; I point out to my peers what to look for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Facebook:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #1d2129; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;We might come away with different conclusions based on whether we watch RT or MSNBC, but a chemical weapons attack on civilians in Douma in April either happened or it didn&#39;t right? That can&#39;t be left as open ended. What I&#39;ve seen, based on several sources, is that it didn&#39;t. We see the video showing where and when the victims were supposedly treated, then go back to the exact same location, same room, same hoses, and interview some of the very same people we saw in the original video. They&#39;re fine. They say the White Helmet people were shouting &quot;chemical attack&quot; and spraying cold water on people. I&#39;m not so relativistic about reality as to think &quot;it happened&quot; and &quot;it didn&#39;t happen&quot; at the same time, as if we were talking about SchrÃ¶dinger&#39;s Cat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #1d2129; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #1d2129; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Where I come down in my investigation of the concept of &quot;gaslighting&quot; is it&#39;s important that a &quot;perpetrator&quot; has to be knowingly deceiving e.g. if RT hired crisis actors and meticulously recreated the original scene, all to give us these fake interview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #1d2129; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;s that made us question our reality, doubt our sanity, that would be gaslighting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Those who believe the Moon Landings were a hoax think that some core people, such as Stanley Kubrick, were gaslighting, i.e. knowingly participating in a ruse. On the other hand, someone who naively believes in the hoax (a whole-hearted dupe, such as myself), is not gaslighting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;If you sincerely believe X and seek to persuade others of X, that&#39;s by definition NOT gaslighting. You have to know that you&#39;re lying and deceiving. Like if you&#39;ve committed murder and want to hide your crime.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been watching postmortems of the invasion of Iraq trying to figure out if Dick Cheney was gaslighting or if he was simply inexperienced in intelligence matters and couldn&#39;t fathom that documents such as the yellow cake from Niger memo might be forged, or that exile expats might lie.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;My current hypothesis is he was dangerously naive and inexperienced and actually believed the misinformation he was being fed. I think most analysts believe he was knowingly lying i.e. gaslighting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: inherit;&quot;&gt;Either way, the lesson learned, it seems, by those eager to prosecute their war, was that pausing to discover the real facts of the case are an impediment and could end up derailing the war plan, so the new technique is to respond without pause, because waiting to discover facts is considered weak. To me, that sounds like a form of insanity and/or like a case of gaslighting (intentional deception).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

I returned the balance of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2018/04/the-americans-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;The Americans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; unwatched.&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;It was getting too addictive&quot; I told the librarian, who empathized.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve got school work to keep up with, and a job to teach what I&#39;ve learned.&lt;br /&gt;

Speaking of which, a film crew was out in force half way up Mt. Tabor.&amp;nbsp; Glenn knew immediately which house I meant and said crews have been there on numerous occasions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why do I doubt it&#39;s just a commercial then, like that guy said?&amp;nbsp; They pointedly don&#39;t have any signs out telling us what they&#39;re filming.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was reading &lt;i&gt;The Economist&lt;/i&gt; this morning at &lt;i&gt;Common Ground&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Sounds like DC is at it again, the rogue city with a grandiosity complex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/04/ridiculously-reckless.html&quot;&gt;gross attack against Syria&lt;/a&gt; reminded me of Clinton&#39;s cruise missile attack on the veterinary medicine plant, but on a much huger scale, in terms of folly.&amp;nbsp; Too Cuban Missile crisis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Havana and Puerto Rico should talk more about trade.&amp;nbsp; DC imposes sanctions everywhere it looks of course, on its colonies especially (Guantanamo, Okinawa, Kwajalein ...).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The macroscope is a lot about gases in the atmosphere and their sources.&amp;nbsp; Methane tends to be a mystery these days.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s rising, but why?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/04/quadrays-again.html&quot;&gt;Quadrays&lt;/a&gt; look like methane, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The satellites are on it.&amp;nbsp; Detective work needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To those saying the &quot;secret&quot; Michael Pompeo meetup with Kim Jong Un is DeepFaked, I say what does it matter?&amp;nbsp; Saves on jet fuel to use avatars.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BJN6gm_HQkM&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Americans&lt;/i&gt; is not actually a movie, but a TV series, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/10/farewell-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;like &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Dexter&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The premise is we&#39;re following the lives of &quot;illegals&quot; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/07/slow-food-nation.html&quot;&gt;the KGB&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The suspense mechanism is similar in all of the above:&amp;nbsp; people with secrets play in close contact with originally unsuspecting others with growing suspicions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mention this series in a recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/spy-camp-499da1c87428&quot;&gt;story about Spy Camp&lt;/a&gt;, as I try to extract positives from this memeplex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I do enjoy about this series is it&#39;s a throwback to the Reagan days, which from the perspective of 2018 is long enough ago to seem a &quot;period&quot; in terms of cars, telephones, and the &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; Training.&amp;nbsp; Lots of excerpts from TV news.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
True enough, &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; was big around DC for awhile.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s where dad did it, whereas I was busy getting in trouble with one of Erhard&#39;s lawyers.&amp;nbsp; Nothing too special.&amp;nbsp; I had my own ideas about where the training might go.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The historical backdrop is this:&amp;nbsp; DC, a determined player given its command over weaponry and trained personnel, was ramping up in Afghanistan and Pakistan in ways designed to make trouble for Russians.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What concerns me though, is how Cowardly Capitalism leaves it to screenwriters to ooze history through the pores of science fiction.&amp;nbsp; Every &quot;real world&quot; TV show conjures up some form of imaginary reality.&amp;nbsp; As FBI agent Beeman makes clear:&amp;nbsp; it was through comic strips about the FBI that he first became interested in becoming an agent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People express skepticism about how much emphasis psychology puts on dreams, fantasy, folktales, theater.&amp;nbsp; Or do they?&amp;nbsp; Once you think about all the hours we subject ourselves to fictional television, the word &quot;programming&quot; takes on new meaning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The portrayal of &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; is pretty good but not perfect.&amp;nbsp; The est Trainer was not alone with the trainees. We had mic runners, logistics supervisor, trainer assistant.&amp;nbsp; The agreement was to do both weekends (keeping one&#39;s word was a big part of it). The screenwriters didn&#39;t have room to get into it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that one of the FBI agents is John Boy from &lt;i&gt;The Waltons&lt;/i&gt; is a further loop-back through earlier archeological layers of memes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oops, I&#39;m wrong:&amp;nbsp; they&#39;re back for their second weekend (&lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt;).&amp;nbsp; Hard to believe all that happened in just five days, but then life is a roller coaster (soap opera, whatever).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1495708/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Covert Affairs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; awhile back.&amp;nbsp; They have a lot in common, however I find the screenwriting deeper on &lt;i&gt;The Americans&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I guess I&#39;m a sucker for this &lt;i&gt;est&lt;/i&gt; stuff.&amp;nbsp; A bit of a nostalgia trip.&lt;/div&gt;

I think we&#39;ve all been impressed by the theme park ride, if we&#39;ve had the pleasure.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m talking less about the rollercoasters than what I called &quot;noisy doors&quot; in remote childhood.&amp;nbsp; The car rides on a track, with passengers not responsible for steering.&amp;nbsp; Sometimes the track veers unexpectedly, part of the fun, and a reminder of helplessness (these rides can be scary).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We understand that a swarm of vehicles, controlled by the same software, could fly down the freeway, not touching.&amp;nbsp; A small town might implement the &quot;Disney&quot; system.&amp;nbsp; I think of it that way because of the rides, the &lt;i&gt;Wild Ride of Mr. Toad&lt;/i&gt; in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So where are &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/driverless-cars-fa2672d7da3b&quot;&gt;the EPCOTs&lt;/a&gt; for testing these technologies?&amp;nbsp; We see the Hyperloop experiments.&amp;nbsp; Prototypes are important, nor must they stay under wraps.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re doing science here.&amp;nbsp; Science evolves through &quot;many eyeballs&quot;.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re a Bazaar, not a Cathedral.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Al Gore to Donald Trump, the rhetoric has been similar:&amp;nbsp; infrastructure needs upgrades.&amp;nbsp; With president Obama, we got the surge, the economic stimulus package, a shot in the arm.&amp;nbsp; But the public sector is locked out.&amp;nbsp; Investors want to keep it all proprietary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Grunch, in the meantime (a word we use, for &quot;supranationals as a group&quot;), needs human subjects. I know that sounds evil.&amp;nbsp; Now I&#39;m thinking of Guinea Pig B, another insider reference.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bernie Sanders:&amp;nbsp; give everyone a job.&amp;nbsp; Reality TV might have a more serious purpose, to show life in an EPCOT.&amp;nbsp; Let people decide for themselves if this is a future to favor.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/05/new-world-order.html&quot;&gt;Product placement&lt;/a&gt; might happen even sans commercials.&amp;nbsp; We see the artifacts in action.&amp;nbsp; We talk about the brands we use.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/26858043117/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Adrenalin Peak, Oak&#39;s Park, Sellwood, Oregon&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Adrenalin Peak, Oak&#39;s Park, Sellwood, Oregon&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/910/26858043117_c6d0512bbd.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I perused &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/05/a-broken-office/556883/&quot;&gt;that &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Monthly&lt;/i&gt; article&lt;/a&gt;, about the old US president&#39;s job being impractical, and listened to the follow-up interview on NPR. I sat in my car in the driveway to get the whole thing, having returned from the elementary school in the blog post below.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A strong president needed input from Intelligence Chiefs, with the word &quot;chief&quot; clearly resonating with N8V American tribes and their chiefdoms (&quot;fire chief&quot; is in there also).&amp;nbsp; Lots of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today was warm and Spring-like (because it&#39;s Spring). Glenn knocked on my door, arousing me from REM sleep.&amp;nbsp; He was on his way to &lt;i&gt;Willamette Week&lt;/i&gt; on his bicycle, upset that &lt;i&gt;Oregon Theater&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;on Division was littering sidewalks with flyers, not even bothering to staple them to phone poles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Upper Hawthorne was awash with these things.&amp;nbsp; He picked them up, which took some hours.&amp;nbsp; I discovered the same littering phenomenon along Foster, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://flic.kr/p/JrDDQh&quot;&gt;took some pictures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also photographed the spanking new rollercoaster at Oak&#39;s Park.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d read about it, and now got to see it for myself.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s brand new and in pristine condition.&amp;nbsp; The park was not open, but pedestrians are welcome to mill about.&amp;nbsp; I walked the bike closer for a better view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My meet-up on Foster was in part about Australian history, today being Battle of Gallipoli Day.&amp;nbsp; Or maybe that was yesterday.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m doing some research on it now, and thinking of the movie &lt;i&gt;Churchill&lt;/i&gt; and his reluctance, per that narrative, to sign on to the Normandy campaign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We talked about the actor George C. Scott.&amp;nbsp; I was right that he starred in &lt;i&gt;Day of the Dolphin&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;man is bad&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most interesting was my discussion with an expert in Icelandic culture in medieval times, the educational institutions in particular.&amp;nbsp; I queried him about the Scandinavian spin on &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/nhlBbHw_fgs&quot;&gt;this word &quot;troll&quot;&lt;/a&gt; which is much in the news lately.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Internet Research Agency&lt;/i&gt; out of St. Petersburg was deemed a &quot;troll farm&quot; by the FBI, but I didn&#39;t see &lt;i&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/i&gt; getting cast as a &quot;troll farm&quot; despite its openly bragging about its meddling in the 2016 election via Facebook.&amp;nbsp; Why the double standard?&amp;nbsp; Are Russians more troll-like than Brits?&amp;nbsp; Evidently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As it turns out, trolls were badass anti-heroes that added spice to a family tree.&amp;nbsp; If you were a weighty House in Norway, you might proudly proclaim some troll blood in your veins.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m reminded of how Neanderthals are in vogue today.&amp;nbsp; Good news if your genetic profile suggests you&#39;re not just a plain vanilla Cro-Magnon.&amp;nbsp; How bland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course I&#39;m aware the term &quot;troll&quot; has developed its own meaning in the context of the Internet.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s also the verb form &quot;to troll&quot; which roughly means &quot;to bait&quot; or even &quot;to tease&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;m about to head out to a distant section of Greater Portland, actually outside the city limits I&#39;m pretty sure, to work with elementary school students on learning to code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Working in this wartime economy is difficult.&amp;nbsp; You might think I&#39;m far away from any wars, living in some American Dream, so what am I talking about?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In truth, North Americans have become psychologically damaged by Endless Wars with no end in sight.&amp;nbsp; The Weapons of Mass Suicide are singing a siren song to a lot of people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This morning I galvanized the Wanderers discussion list to pick up some controversial topic for debate, something with science and engineering angles.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ll be looking at so-called 5G and the topic of microwave radiation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s a sense that we&#39;re drowning in false reports and propaganda.&amp;nbsp; The narratives have not grown up sufficiently to sound realistic, so we get these little nightmare scenarios.&amp;nbsp; We know they have a short half life. I think that&#39;s because we&#39;ve already outgrown the nation-state system, such as it was, but so what if that&#39;s what I think.&amp;nbsp; What people feel are the constraints of the straitjacket.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People take refuge in what&#39;s slower moving, the more cosmic, the wheel of life itself.&amp;nbsp; The political narratives of the wartime economy are a source of brain damage.&amp;nbsp; Lets just call it &quot;wrong frequency&quot; and seek protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m all for increasing tourism to replace terrorism.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s stereotypically a leisure class activity and a lot of people are being expelled from the leisure class.&amp;nbsp; Another way to tour is in uniform, not as a guest necessarily, but as an armed combatant.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s how many get to see the world today, as terrorists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, we also see that many of those engaged in the fighting cannot afford uniforms.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re civilians defending a piece of turf, turned into combatants by circumstance.&amp;nbsp; North Americans see how this phenomenon is spreading and cling to their own weapons just in case.&amp;nbsp; They see Aleppo and realize that cities are not safe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s what happens in wartime.&amp;nbsp; Planning for the future tends to low ebb.&amp;nbsp; People just don&#39;t see a shared vision.&amp;nbsp; Only positive science fiction is in any way unifying.&amp;nbsp; Dystopian science fiction is more ubiquitous, but then people can&#39;t agree on it as easily.&amp;nbsp; The narrative fragments even as it demoralizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#39;t bother my students with world affairs.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re focused on learning skills and concepts.&amp;nbsp; I do my best to exit the wartime economy and create a small oasis of peacetime for them.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;iframe allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/UXoOceeqJ-o&quot; width=&quot;560&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our breakfast meeting was about GST, in particular the question of how best to teach thermodynamics in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/E3GBC4e5yFY&quot;&gt;the global economy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, I&#39;m not talking about global warming or climate change, so much as what we call the Earth&#39;s energy budget.&amp;nbsp; How much energy comes in, and how much goes out?&amp;nbsp; Terry emphasizes that it&#39;s close to net zero, otherwise the global temperature would be increasing or cooling much faster than it is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, I take it back, there&#39;s a global warming aspect to the equations.&amp;nbsp; Just to be clear though, we&#39;re looking at how hydrocarbons impound solar energy to create vegetation, forests and so on.&amp;nbsp; Then there&#39;s the rain cycle:&amp;nbsp; evaporation feeds rivers and an endless supply of water flowing downhill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans stick their water wheels into these rivers and thereby get more horsepower than ever.&amp;nbsp; The same strategy gets us hydroelectric power today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Malthus appreciated that life increased at geometric rates (exponentially) in the right conditions. That includes vegetation, however since surface area is a constraint on arable land, he forecast a human population outstripping food supplies in the near future.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Terry, whom I was meeting with, also Glenn, went to the same London School of Economics, ages later.&amp;nbsp; The population was pushing towards ten billion but growth rates were slowing according to some metrics.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s interested in the history of thermodynamics going back especially to French language thinkers &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/AfsZiHEcoxk&quot;&gt;Pierre-Louis de Maupertuis&lt;/a&gt; and the Carnots (Lazare and Sadi).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
GST does factor in solar power as the major ecosystem driver of life on Earth, but of course it takes more than power to make a system go.&amp;nbsp; One needs components, complexity, organisms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How the build-up in complexity affects any global entropy measure, if that makes any sense, is still an open question in my book.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m looking for more authors to address it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After breakfast, Glenn and I walked to the Friends Meeting on Stark, by way of &lt;i&gt;Movie Madness&lt;/i&gt;, and met with several Friends.&amp;nbsp; We were heading up Mt. Tabor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I had a 2 PM appointment with an earnest student of what I might call psychological physics, also known by the label &lt;i&gt;Deep Democracy&lt;/i&gt; as championed by Arnold Mindell and associates based here in Portland.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been to a few of Arnie&#39;s workshops and studied his writings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Physics, in proposing to offer &quot;theories of everything&quot; tends to get drawn in to talking about such memes as &quot;consciousness&quot; which of course connects them to what &quot;unconscious&quot; might mean.&amp;nbsp; Typically, an &quot;unconscious being&quot; is simply unaware of some otherness, insofar as it has any awareness.&amp;nbsp; I realize that&#39;s a circular definition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took a lot of pictures of book covers and book contents throughout the day, given the veritable blizzard of information coming at me.&amp;nbsp; What better way to make a record?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, I went through my camera battery doing that, such that when it came time to attend my friend Matthew&#39;s sixtieth birthday (we&#39;re about the same age), I had to grab a backup camera, the one that was starting to jam (it gets paralyzed). The backup camera jammed every time this time, so I feel back on my Android for any pictures.&amp;nbsp; This was out in Tualitin-Sherwood, at the Century Hotel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
D&#39;Arcy Thompson was a main figure in the morning meeting, so when I got back I started reading his &lt;i&gt;On Growth and Form&lt;/i&gt; again.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve never read it cover to cover.&amp;nbsp; Then I found some Youtubes about the guy, including the one linked above. D&#39;Arcy was a big inspiration behind this new book &lt;i&gt;Scale&lt;/i&gt; by Geoffrey West which I&#39;ve been reading, and recommending.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The US and UK no longer have a functioning mainstream media when it comes to reporting &quot;news&quot;.  The independent voices have access to the internet.  RT has helped a smarter group stay in public consciousness.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Although I made a token appearance at Wanderers tonight, I didn&#39;t have much energy for conversation, and left early, seeking cheap caffeine, which I have at my place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was marathon &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/04/more-therapy-needed.html&quot;&gt;psychotherapy day&lt;/a&gt; with H&amp;amp;R Block, only to find out that the USPO had changed pickup times at Fred Meyers.&amp;nbsp; Only yesterday, April 16, the day before the tax rush.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunately, I had an afternoon gig in Clackamas County.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, the detour to Fred Meyers cost me valuable minutes and a few kids gave up on me and went home as usual.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll be there extra early next time.&amp;nbsp; One of those schools where if you show up when the bell rings, you have no way of parking.&amp;nbsp; My first day in Happy Valley (that&#39;s not the name of the school).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After an hour with the kids sharing MIT Scratch, a favorite of Portland Public Schools (I&#39;m private sector), I used the maps app to find the nearest post office.&amp;nbsp; The thing is:&amp;nbsp; these were amended returns and it&#39;s especially true that the State of Oregon freezes whatever you claimed on this date.&amp;nbsp; I had a few dollars in savings, which, to me, actually means something.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sent checks with both returns and have Trimet queued.&amp;nbsp; I just need to wait for a couple invoices to clear.&amp;nbsp; In the meantime, I have overdraft protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s all going through the motions for me, as it hurts to face extortion by organized crime, which is how it feels when an executive at some far off desk job chooses the most reckless course possible, thinking people buy the farcical &quot;reality TV&quot; they&#39;re pumping out to us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You know how it is.&amp;nbsp; My family tried to live overseas as much as possible to avoid propping up the military junta, as we might as well say in the open now. The facts are on the table.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve lived under martial law before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You don&#39;t need to declare war to have war.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a lesson these latter day executives have taken to heart.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Look at what happened in Saudi Arabia.&amp;nbsp; A hoax puppet, made to seem smart, got to be a Saudi citizen and address the UN, making a mockery of the curriculum everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Who needs &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/02/yes-men-fix-world-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Yes Men&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/a&gt;anymore, when supposedly bright people are this gullible?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I take the high fear levels around AI, traceable to &lt;i&gt;Terminator&lt;/i&gt; movies, as a projection of what we most fear:&amp;nbsp; that our own conditioned reflexes, our robotic side, will end civilization.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a real danger.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re 99% robot, with only 1% &quot;that of God&quot; (intuitively minded). Our robotic side is very useful in a pinch, but may also get us killed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The real danger of AI is that we, the really intelligent (RI) will become dumber and dumber, turning into robots.&amp;nbsp; The army of PhDs, so-called &quot;doctors of philosophy&quot; aren&#39;t fighting back it seems.&amp;nbsp; They&#39;re surrendering to their own artificialness, turning phony to their cores.&amp;nbsp; AI = PI (phony intelligence).&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s everywhere.&lt;/div&gt;

I took in this masterful piece of storytelling at Glenn&#39;s place.&amp;nbsp; He had it checked out of &lt;i&gt;Multnomah County Library&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Nicole Kidman plays Gertrude Bell, and creates a haunting tale of a big soul, another Tara in her world (this one of camels and pyramids, and Lawrence of Arabia -- set somewhat the same time as &lt;i&gt;Wonder Woman&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;the big movie&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gertrude felt horribly penned in by British domestic society and begged her dad for more adventure. Good patriarch that he was, he found her a situation in Tehran, where she fell in love with the culture, and the third ranking secretary (male persuasion). Her dad was not about to give his property to that gambling house (they wished to marry) and the situation deteriorated (neither was fully a master of their own destiny, but then who is?).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Flash forward, and Gertrude is amongst the Bedouin.&amp;nbsp; She has the truly healthy and in no way twisted ethic of the anthropologist just hoping to understand her / his fellow man.&amp;nbsp; She knows at some level that she&#39;s helping to stabilize the situation simply through the force of her own integrity.&amp;nbsp; The men respect that and understand she&#39;s playing as they do, for high stakes and respect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Werner Herzog employs either cranes or drones we don&#39;t know, perhaps all mysteries were revealed in The Making Of, but on this date and time, I needed to withdraw and continue with my overall mission.&amp;nbsp; That includes another rendezvous, and then more thinking about Machine Learning in tandem with Synergetics.&amp;nbsp; Glenn was all about Bayesian geostatistics this evening, flipping through the latest &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think of my mom and her sojourning with Coptics, south of Cairo.&amp;nbsp; Women with big souls often are first over the walls, you could say riding broomsticks, but why not also with respect.&amp;nbsp; Women are not some lesser species, after all.&amp;nbsp; Not that this needs reiterating in polite company.&amp;nbsp; Feel free to resume enjoying your desserts.&amp;nbsp; Coffee anyone?&amp;nbsp; I think I&#39;ll have one.&lt;/div&gt;

The Colony of Puerto Rico, called a Commonwealth as that sounds better, is not free to accept ships from just anywhere. The hurricane was a jobs program for many maritime workers, not to mention pilots, if only for evacuation purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Jones Act is what I&#39;m urging AFSC to keep studying.&amp;nbsp; Lots of analysis slowly brews and gets untapped at a later date. Just like with the HVDC lines, and all that research (GENI etc.), and with the refugee issues studied by UNHCR, the learning phase takes time.&amp;nbsp; Detective work is sometimes painstaking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The above connects to the Chinese Peace Corps meme, which is somewhat esoteric.&amp;nbsp; The idea for free eyeglasses for all who need them, as a bare minimum living standard expectation, sounded like something Chinese would think of, and then encourage by means of inexpensive aid programs, in Walmart parking lots perhaps, in Michigan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
North Americans sometimes don&#39;t see themselves in need of care and assistance.&amp;nbsp; Yet the rest of the world sees a lot of sickness on their screens, and lots of acting out around the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having Chinese help provide eyeglasses might seem demeaning, as if &quot;the richest nation on earth&quot; couldn&#39;t organize such a thing.&amp;nbsp; But it couldn&#39;t.&amp;nbsp; More likely it would punch you in the face and break the glasses you already have.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think the struggling people of North America are more aware of their pain and therefore more likely to assist others, whereas those enjoying insulated lives want to control how much the dispossessed try to help one another.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a long way of saying we won&#39;t be angry if other countries ignore the embargo against Puerto Rico.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Targeting Puerto Rico for sanctions was never fair in the first place.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/3292180674/in/photolist-5uinAK-e897Lq-6EhymY-61VhBL&quot; title=&quot;Globe &amp;amp; Map&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Globe &amp;amp; Map&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3189/3292180674_08cf3c0611.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have the telescope and microscope, have for decades (though both keep morphing), yet no &quot;macroscope&quot; is a household word.&amp;nbsp; Why?&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s a &quot;macroscope&quot; anyway?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Google Earth has come about as close as anyone to declassifying a Big Earth animated globe thingy, but not in real time, as people aren&#39;t ready for &quot;everyone seeing everything&quot; through satellites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of us want to guard against poachers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was my big push with drones, and not as shooters.&amp;nbsp; Inform the authorities and set up whatever road blocks or check stations. If there&#39;s a way to save more animals, consider the options.&amp;nbsp; I digress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I never supported their use in warfare, though of course war is not about &quot;fair&quot; and no one asked my permission, one way or the other. I never called for their use against Julian either, even in jest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Buckminster Fuller suggested &quot;geoscope&quot; for the same thing, and got close in 1967, when the original US State Department proposal was for an unfolding geoscope that formed a Dymaxion Projection (same Gaussian as a Snyder pretty much but in a unique arrangement ideally suited to keeping contiguous landmasses contiguous).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those adjoined only by oceans get spread apart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Expo people decided that might be too cerebral and why not go with a giant geodesic dome instead, a smaller version memorialized at EPCOT in Orlando, decades latter?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Montreal 67 was the Taj Mahal of geodesic structures.&amp;nbsp; No nation has had more self respect than Canada, when it comes to hosting such a bold architecture.&amp;nbsp; Makes sense:&amp;nbsp; Donald Coxeter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later blueprints anchored a Geoscope in East River opposite the UN building, a convenience for those inside, and a tourist attraction.&amp;nbsp; The tensegrity moorings would have competed for attention with the tensegrity radio tower atop New York&#39;s newest trade center, had either project been completed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kenneth Snelson of Needle Tower fame (Washington DC) and many other tensegrity structures, had been approached about providing one as a finishing touch to the new skyscraper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Actually, macroscopes do exist, for precisely the purpose intended, the display of global data.&amp;nbsp; They just don&#39;t enjoy the courtesy of an instrument name, such as &quot;telescope&quot; and &quot;microscope&quot; enjoy.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re to get by with &quot;globe&quot; or &quot;planetary data display&quot; or some generic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s as of 2018 BCE in my specific locale (OR 97214), where I monitor only a subsample of how the world population speaks (by &quot;world population&quot; I mean to include those in low orbit aboard staffed machines).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn Stockton of Global Matrix fame keeps tabs on such literature and is well aware of the many authors and authorities involved in macroscope development.&amp;nbsp; Again, Google Earth is representative of the state of the art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in what ways has this asset been incorporated into the elementary, middle and high school grades?&amp;nbsp; The vector towards becoming a &quot;household word&quot; is through percolation within a curriculum.&amp;nbsp; Who looks at Earth?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More schools may be screening macroscopes soon.&amp;nbsp; The LCDs might not be interactive, but are instead preprogrammed to hop around, like a programmed Planetarium projector might do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are related devices (Planetariums and Macroscopes), as Christian Science Mapparium (Boston, MA) clearly demonstrates.&amp;nbsp; Observers stand inside the planet in question, with global data appearing as stained glass. Might pixels be referred to as &quot;stained&quot; when containing RGB &quot;dyes&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Look for macroscopes in Dubai?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Lower48 keeps telling itself it&#39;s the richest &quot;nation&quot; on Earth -- which is touching -- and we want these folks to succeed.&amp;nbsp; But lets be honest:&amp;nbsp; their budget for education is far outclassed by those working harder for their children.&amp;nbsp; End Timers have reason to be lazy, in proportion to the certainty with which they cling to those beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not claiming all North Americans are End Timers, let alone all in Lower48.&amp;nbsp; But those who are ready to see it all come to a full stop probably won&#39;t see the need for planners or futurists.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s the point, right?&lt;/div&gt;
