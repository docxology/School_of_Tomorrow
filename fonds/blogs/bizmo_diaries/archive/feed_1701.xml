Maybe later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allen is positing Polynesians starting in the New Guinea area, radiating toward Tahiti, then settling Hawai&#39;i in like the last 1K years. Perhaps a lost vessel followed the light and ash of an active volcano, once close enough to see them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hawai&#39;i is still under construction:  new islands expected, as the volcanic chain progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stars (their rising and setting positions), wave angle and frequency, cloud formations, bird sightings, all fed into the Polynesians&#39; executive level decision-making process.

Whether used or not, it&#39;s the intent behind them that exudes low living standards and foments mental squalor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soulless zombie wombat corporations (only fictitiously human) feed on those still living, sapping their strength and intelligence, perpetuating obsolete and irrelevant reflex-conditioning (jerky puppets, &quot;Pinocchio syndrome&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was doing BBQ this evening, on Kim &amp;amp; Jimmy&#39;s new rig (I helped them assemble it), but first drove Carol (Mom) to the event, at Waterfront Park, and got a full report afterwards (from &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/methodist-morning.html&quot;&gt;Maureen&lt;/a&gt; as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently Bucky Fuller&#39;s idea of &quot;final exam time&quot; was used to frame the main speaker&#39;s speech (Maureen:  &quot;he&#39;s a medical doctor&quot;).  Several hundred people turned out.  The City forgot to turn off its sprinkler system, which came on towards the end of the event, but spirits were not dampened thereby, thanks to taiko drummers and company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been on the phone with brother Sam this morning.  Apparently Bud is willing to help back our bizmo concept from his HQS in Florida.  Also, friend Kathleen sent this &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/pw2cm&quot;&gt;helpful picture&lt;/a&gt;.  We&#39;re definitely cookin&#39; with gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in celebration of our livingry-based global culture, I bought a used 60 gig iPod complete with iDog and extra speakers on eBay (shipper in Indiana).  August 6 is a time to think ahead to a promising future, as well as to celebrate our escape from the wrong thinking of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also watched the pilot of &lt;a style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389564/&quot;&gt;The 4400&lt;/a&gt; (on loan from Elizabeth) and some &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Popeye&lt;/span&gt; cartoons from the mid 1950s, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0151908/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Parlez Vous Woo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (speaking of wrong thinking see pg. 111 of Todd Schorr&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dreamland&lt;/span&gt;, Last Gasp Press, ISBN 0-86719-589-4).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115497154509013952'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115497154509013952'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/hiroshima-day.html' title='Hiroshima Day'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115481569316262239</id><published>2006-08-05T15:08:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-12-26T15:33:21.087-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Buckaneers</title><content type='html'>Before our detractors get ahold of it, and say it sneeringly, lets add a Mickey Mouse Club spin and be happy for our growing ranks of Buckaneers and Buckaneer wannabes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Good morning boyz &amp;amp; girlz, and now let&#39;s see what &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/toyz.html&quot;&gt;new toyz&lt;/a&gt; we might share with you today&quot; (yes, I know you&#39;re sick and tired of killer rockets, bombs in cars, but take heart: this is a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;livingry&lt;/span&gt; show).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Buckaneer&quot; is an alternative to &quot;Fullerite,&quot; &quot;Buckyophile,&quot; &quot;Fuller devotee&quot; and/or &quot;disciple&quot; (said with curled lip).

The ribs join to a backbone, which is where a lot of low level reflexes get wired, which is what built-in methods do (react as callables). So we&#39;re really building up this class/creature metaphor at the &quot;ascii art&quot; level, as well as conceptually: a strong mnemonic, a cornucopia of relevant associations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there&#39;s a move characteristic of the Bucky-informed brands: we associate ribs with eaves (pun), the idea of a ceiling: on a boat flipped over. Boats are the original hulls (of sea peoples anyway), but brought up on land, and flipped over, they become houses.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may recall &quot;the home&quot; (as a paradigm class) is a another core feature of my emerging Pythonic pedagogy -- except we&#39;ll be branching out into DwellingMachines(maybe as a subclass of a common ancestor).[2]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1] R. Buckminster Fuller, Tetrascroll: A Cosmic Fairy Tale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[2] &quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I think using the home as a paradigm class is propitious, as there&#39;s lots of implied complexity, especially once HVAC and AC/DC become a focus (lots of APIs). You have the media room, the pantry, the scullery -- the whole pattern language of places. The Sims gives us visuals. OO gives us implementations.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-May/006543.html&quot;&gt;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-May/006543.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Edu-sig] More OO chatter from the Edubuntu box kirby urner kirby.urner at gmail.com Mon May 29 22:32:00 CEST 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115471899606038876'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115471899606038876'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/python-pedagogy.html' title='Python Pedagogy'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115449560085952646</id><published>2006-08-02T16:48:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2014-12-17T16:52:08.775-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Blaming Castro</title><content type='html'>I wonder if anyone else&#39;ll pick up on this remark by CBS News National Correspondent Byron Pitts last night:  &quot;and by shipping Russian missiles to Cuba in 1962, Castro took the world closer to nuclear war than it&#39;s ever been.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So it&#39;s not a nuclear war if only &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;other&lt;/span&gt; countries get it in the neck?  This close to the anniversary of the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, I think we should cop to the fact that WWII went nuclear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not surprised Israeli military spokesmen keep sounding these little brother notes, trying to act so shockingly and awesomely brutal, just like their big brother king of the kill.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s human nature to seek the admiration of role models.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later that same night, I caught part of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;48 Hours&lt;/span&gt; (which I don&#39;t usually):  was Marilyn Monroe murdered because of her intimate and politically sensitive relationships with the Kennedy brothers?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That would seem far-fetched.  I don&#39;t believe it.  Neither did the principal journalist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/05/murder-mystery.html&quot;&gt;Murder Inc.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; had much more on its mind than maid Marilyn back then (Fidel Castro for example -- and Diem).  The Kennedys could be protected in other, more benign ways (until it became their turn -- and here I &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; believe in &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/05/murder-mystery.html&quot;&gt;a cover up&lt;/a&gt;, per &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prouty.org/&quot;&gt;Prouty&lt;/a&gt;).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115449560085952646'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115449560085952646'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/blaming-castro.html' title='Blaming Castro'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115436741033866393</id><published>2006-07-31T17:04:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2011-10-18T13:43:42.516-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Making Waves in DC</title><content type='html'>So I was living in DC, with my parents between assignments, me out of Princeton by then, looking for a life, post being a high school teacher at St. Dom&#39;s for two years.  That&#39;d been my next assignment after being this heavily-into-Wittgenstein&#39;s philosophy dude (I wore an LW T-Shirt, a gift from dear Linda, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/05/princeton-25th-reunion.html&quot;&gt;2D alum&lt;/a&gt; like dear Selma, dear Vicky, dear Tom...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philosophy included diving head first into &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;est&lt;/span&gt;, leading to Bucky (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/fuller-archive.html&quot;&gt;check public records&lt;/a&gt; on that score) and his hot-off-the-press (St. Martin&#39;s) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312174918/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Critical Path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Like any good fact checker, for the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;New Yorker&lt;/span&gt; say, I was wanting to verify some apparently newly declassified details from maritime history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I nagged at the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Washington Post&lt;/span&gt; for a story, by sending &#39;em faux headlines in sort of early &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Comedy Central&lt;/span&gt; (kinda edgy).  Just another guy with a typewriter in DC, trying to make a name for himself, ho hum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, if you know how Washington works, you know that things don&#39;t stay simple for long.  Word gets out and around, probably at those fabled cocktail parties, embassy types gossip, and before ya know it, you&#39;re getting a lot of subtle messages too.  Wow, democracy in action.  Kinda fun.  Kinda creepy.  Probably Moscow&#39;s the same way (I was through there once, but only on a short assignment, again with my family).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime later (1985?) I became a Stansfield Turner devotee, having scanned his newly minted &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060970251/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Secrecy and Democracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (I was still trying to figure out about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7589887&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;those sea peoples&lt;/a&gt; and Turner was Navy).  That was like my intro to the Zendo, and after that I was hooked, following other DCIs&#39; careers both &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/history/intel/index.html&quot;&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743274032/&quot;&gt;after&lt;/a&gt;, paying at least some attention to the intelligence community&#39;s kabuki dances (not all set in DC, thankfully).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#39;ve read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974060518/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Critical Path&lt;/span&gt;&#39;s sequel) you know the CIA was all over it, with Applewhite&#39;s sly blurb on the back and all kinds of weird banker talk (check out political cartoons of DCI Casey at the time, a Mr. Moneybags who was always &quot;scalping&quot; people (odd combo)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[ Our dear friend Mary just called, to ask about Dawn (she&#39;s doin&#39; OK, just printed a bunch of laser checks, bills and donations, which I&#39;ve just collated, signed and mailed). Mary and Chuck are heading into the Cascades today (sounds wonderful). ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another angle:  Bucky liked hanging out with the retired brass at the Center for Defense Information (CDI), where my buddy from high school worked as an archivist.  But as any journalist knows, just because an audiotape matches a book &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;by the same author&lt;/span&gt; doesn&#39;t count.  The police work here was to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/omnitriangulating.html&quot;&gt;cross-check&lt;/a&gt;, not prove at least minimal self-consistency (Bucky was hardly a nut case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That first DC assignment didn&#39;t last all that long (my parents moved to Bangladesh).  But I&#39;d be back again later, in 1984, this time living on my own, and working for Americans for Civic Participation (aka Project VOTE!), trying to get USAers to believe in the whole idea of voting again (this was before private computer companies told us how we&#39;d voted).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We worked with Jessie Jackson&#39;s group (he&#39;d dropped out of the presidential race by then, so no 501(c)(3) problem there).  Reagan won a second term (another low turnout), and I joined McGraw-Hill in New York, thanks to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;est&lt;/span&gt; buddy and Jersey City cronie &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0809225905/sr=8-7/qid=1154362405/&quot;&gt;Ray Simon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then again I was through, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/gobbledygook.html&quot;&gt;this time with Matt&lt;/a&gt;, to drop in on Ed and score a gift copy of his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0824087291/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics Dictionary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in four volumes (a treasure).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also back in the day, when AFSC&#39;d fly me from Portland to Philly for board meetings, I&#39;d spend time with Chris Fearnley and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/kiyoshi.html&quot;&gt;Kiyoshi Kuromiya&lt;/a&gt;, then train down to DC for more meetings (open jaw plane ticket), culminating in our &lt;a href=&quot;http://synergeticists.org/&quot;&gt;SNEC summit&lt;/a&gt;, hosted by Russell Chu.  That was my second time to meet Joe Clinton, plus Ed&#39;s presence made it official (Bonnie&#39;s too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most recently, I was in DC for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/03/pycon-2005.html&quot;&gt;Pycon&lt;/a&gt; @ GWU (the one before Texas), showing off my synergetics hypertoon (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/life.html&quot;&gt;Python + VPython&lt;/a&gt;, runs on a laptop).  The year before that (2004), there&#39;d been that Bucky Symposium, also at GWU (&lt;a href=&quot;http://home.gwu.edu/~damico/damico.html&quot;&gt;Blaine D&#39;Amico&lt;/a&gt; hosting), and a Pycon just starting when I got the news of my wife&#39;s stage 3 cancer and quickly flew home.  That was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html&quot;&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;d see Ed, though we still &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/national-treasure-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;phoned each other&lt;/a&gt; sometimes.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115436741033866393'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115436741033866393'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/making-waves-in-dc.html' title='Making Waves in DC'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115422693145056269</id><published>2006-07-29T19:29:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:59.476-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Summer of 2006</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/aliceineXistenZ.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/aliceineXistenZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;font-size:85%;&quot; &gt;Alice in eXistenZ&lt;br /&gt;(photo by K.

Result:  I couldn&#39;t collect the colorful license plate tags proving I have my act together as a driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well today, I got that silly knock sensor replaced, by Mountain Tech in historic Oregon City, a city started by Hudson&#39;s Bay Company well before Oregon herself became a Union republic (when she joined, Oregon City became her first capital -- a privilege since ceded).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While waiting for the necessary repairs, I toured the newest county Public Service Building.  Tom&#39;s Transportation Reaching People (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/fragment-of-day.html&quot;&gt;TRP&lt;/a&gt;), which I used to write code for, occupies space on the ground floor.[1]  I was glad to see Tina again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice, sometimes a volunteer driver, swung by and drove me back to my car, after which we caught up over lunch (Mexican), with Tom joining us later from work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alice&#39;s family visited ours in Rome, back when her dad was on sabbatical in then Yugoslavia.  Our families (Pinneys, Martins, Jumps, Hazel Hemphill...) were among the original founders of the Multnomah Quakers, when they inherited the building on Stark Street from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/planting-seeds-in-silicon-forest.html&quot;&gt;Electro-Measurements Inc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I updated Alice some about &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/quaker-politics_110167340290091180.html&quot;&gt;my Qv2 work&lt;/a&gt;, while Tom and I talked about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/more-bizmology.html&quot;&gt;NavAm&lt;/a&gt;, a dream for a new airline.  And of course we reminisced about driving &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/machine-world.html&quot;&gt;Gutless&lt;/a&gt; to Montana that time.  We also talked about Ron Braithwaite&#39;s dream to help pioneer &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/07/wanderers-meeting-200575.html&quot;&gt;Carewheels Canada&lt;/a&gt; (a misnomer I think, as &quot;wheels&quot; is not meant to connote driving).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Razz&#39;s repaired computer needed to go through a full drive cycle before trying again through DEQ, so I drove her all the way to Washington State, then back over the I-205 bridge to PDX (the airport), along the Columbia Slough past the Air National Guard and FedEx, ending up at the DEQ just north of Columbia Blvd. on NE 33rd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To celebrate passing my test (yay), I joined Don on the Columbia River.  We moored on the Washington side and discussed Wanderers (a favorite pass time), plus I handled family business on my cell.  From that vantage point, Mts. Tabor and Scott, and Rocky Butte, are all easily visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/tomoftrp.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/200/tomoftrp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Tom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;[1] I wrote the early dBase application, while my successor, Ness Mountain and company, rewrote it in Microsoft Access as a colorful GUI app.  Now the county itself maintains the code.

You face the user like a punching bag, but instead of hunched over, like an opposing boxer, you&#39;re this super-sensitive surface, alert to every mouse motion and key press (up and down strokes separately).  That sounds kinda painful, so let&#39;s tone it down:  you&#39;re coding a user-friendly surface, open to unprogrammed sequences of attack (click, click, &#39;r&#39;,&#39;r&#39;... etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wxpython.org/&quot;&gt;wxPython&lt;/a&gt;, every wxWidget inherits from an Events-minded superclass, meaning every surface is available for signal processing.  There&#39;s an implied hierarchy, where unhandled events either die unreported, or trickle up the chain of command, which is automatically searched both ancestrally (an inheritance tree) and in terms of successive containers (what widget&#39;s inside of what, out to the top frame and/or application object).  The programmer needs to explicitly bind a widget&#39;s event handler to whatever types of event (not all events get treated equally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wxwidgets.org/&quot;&gt;wxWidgets&lt;/a&gt; is actually a C++ library, some 20 years in development, and reaches into each platform (Mac, Windows, Linux) for a native look and feel (unlike Tk, for example, which is equally strange on every OS -- which some people &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;like&lt;/span&gt;).  wxPython uses SWIG to wrap this library, exposing its functionality in familiar Python syntax.  Plus Robin and friends add a few new bells and whistles just for those lucky snake charmers among us (other gnu languages bind to wx as well, including Ruby and Perl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we roll around to &lt;a href=&quot;http://business.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=06/08/01/1234216&amp;amp;tid=18&amp;amp;tid=138&amp;amp;pagenum=1&quot;&gt;OSCON 2006&lt;/a&gt; in Portland, gnu math teachers have a new resource to help feed those developing their appetite for facing-the-user &quot;GUI goo&quot;, an acquired taste to be sure.  The resource?  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;wxPython in Action&lt;/span&gt; by Noel Rappin and Robin Dunn (Manning Publications, 2006), ISBN 1-932394-62-1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wxPython is sponsored in part by the Open Source Applications Foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.osafoundation.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/200/osAFLogo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Follow-up&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/11/26/monday-inspiration-user-experience-of-the-future/&quot;&gt;Monday Inspiration: User Experiences of the Future&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Smashing Magazine&lt;/span&gt; (November 26, 2007)</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115403796812696728'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115403796812696728'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/gotta-luv-that-gui-goo.html' title='Gotta Luv that GUI Goo'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115394026833214507</id><published>2006-07-26T00:15:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2010-06-18T21:56:50.210-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Practicing Multiculturalism</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Originally posted to math-teach @ Math Forum.

He had no trouble navigating our lengthy driveway (somewhat steep), and we sat on the back patio, which I&#39;d doused with H20 (we&#39;re enduring a heat wave).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our home interior is not accessible to Wayne, at least not without splitting him from his chair and carrying him -- a process involving heavy lifting our household is not trained in doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wayne, in late middle age, long stricken with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kidshealth.org/kid/health_problems/bone/muscular_dystrophy.html&quot;&gt;muscular dystrophy&lt;/a&gt;, a ham radio operator and geek, dreams of communities with floorplans he could thrive in.  That means room for hobbies, as well as wheel chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A big mistake they make with older people is making them leave behind their hobbies and skills, often a principal means of communication with an outside world (including a community of fellow hobbiests).  Wayne wants to keep operating his ham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told Wayne I too day dreamed of prototype communities, each an experiment in different dimensions. Like some might be exploring extremes in weather conditions, while others were more known for their internal dynamics (outwardly: nothing special).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We wouldn&#39;t guarantee ADA compliance to Wayne&#39;s level in all of the villages, but that&#39;d be a dimension to go in with a goodly number of them, certainly.  Enter your search criteria, and see what comes up.  Zoom in for more details (and remember:  not every village is even open to visitors, at least not in all seasons).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice to Wayne was to keep focusing on television, as a place to expect such prototyping to converge with reality TV. Speaking purely selfishly:  I&#39;d like to be able to watch Wayne&#39;s progress, during times when he wasn&#39;t right there in front of me, like today. At least he&#39;s thinking of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloglines.com/blog/Graceful-Not&quot;&gt;starting a blog&lt;/a&gt; (a practice I encourage among Friends, given our tradition of keeping journals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told him about our pilot in CUE&#39;s heyday, directed by Melinda, which imparted TV-making skills to retired citizens, plus gave &#39;em a time slot on cable to share their handiwork.  My work at AFSC similarly coincided with a big push into television, this time with UV/LAAP youth in the control booth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also suggested that some of his flexible floor plan ideas might have obvious application in the downtown skyscrapers, on those floors that scrap the cubes in favor of the lived-in work-studio dorm room approach, with shared facilities (recording studio, editing rooms, computer labs -- and of course cafeterias).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas the billions we spend on military projects have to be kept secret (or even top secret), by definition, civilian projects like Wayne&#39;s are amenable to a more open source treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course between the bright light of day and high def celebs, and the shades-drawn world of black budget secrets, lies a twilight zone of stuff we&#39;re still working on, and don&#39;t really want to be too public about yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what niche market TV is good for, like underground comix.  We&#39;re not looking for big blockbuster sensations or American Idols, just real people with passion, movers and shakers like Wayne, ready to dive head first into interesting programming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrK22zE9EEdbTmldzWHhxAlqqBaLEqeOA7mZViZAvVVcA2ISWtID9FgriudER3dhOKeFC6aY-pnuf-B7DkSlVXnWtHE2hcZrPWs63auPAvhCc5nzZV0v78P7rJizo5_fjnbl97/s1600-h/wayne2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrK22zE9EEdbTmldzWHhxAlqqBaLEqeOA7mZViZAvVVcA2ISWtID9FgriudER3dhOKeFC6aY-pnuf-B7DkSlVXnWtHE2hcZrPWs63auPAvhCc5nzZV0v78P7rJizo5_fjnbl97/s200/wayne2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5125467263857551250&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115370746081093444'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115370746081093444'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/more-brainstorming-about-ecovillages.html' title='More Brainstorming about EcoVillages'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjrK22zE9EEdbTmldzWHhxAlqqBaLEqeOA7mZViZAvVVcA2ISWtID9FgriudER3dhOKeFC6aY-pnuf-B7DkSlVXnWtHE2hcZrPWs63auPAvhCc5nzZV0v78P7rJizo5_fjnbl97/s72-c/wayne2.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115361334765609666</id><published>2006-07-22T18:05:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-10-25T19:46:02.985-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Visitors</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2004-December/004187.html&quot;&gt;Les&lt;/a&gt; came by with family today.

Mom continues flitting about, internationally and domestically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn is having lots of meetings today, all of them nearby.

The Overseas School of Rome (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4909130&amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;OSR&lt;/a&gt;), 811 Via Cassia, looks much as it did, from high up anyway.  I thrived in that school, in that city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#39;t find Galeria, the hidden ghost town (emptied by the plague) I used to play in, near Lake Bracciano, where we once camped lakeside 24/7 for awhile (borrowed a sail boat), having given up the city apartment (Urners in transition).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In eighth grade, my last at OSR, two positive developments stand out:  Dr. Gilespie, an MD but without a license to practice in Italy, taught our biology class instead, as if this were like medical school (way cool to learn bio from a real doctor, though hard on those prone to hypochondria); and Paul Henderson showed up (he was a part of that bio class).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul&#39;s dad had been managing a game park in Nigeria, and had now come to Rome, world headquarters for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fao.org/&quot;&gt;the FAO&lt;/a&gt;.  Paul was this deep-voiced, muscular kid, who&#39;d left a pet python behind, and knew how to snap his fingers real loud.  He was an instant sensation, plus his family joined our Quaker meeting.  His sister was likewise a bombshell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mom had been our cub scout den mother, though we were transitioning to Hayden Dunn&#39;s dad for weblos.  I can&#39;t remember if Paul joined our company (Mahlon, Joe, Kijoon...).  Joe&#39;s mom and Mr. Dunn actually ended up getting married.  Joe was from Texas, Beaumont, as I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That summer, my parents headed an AFSC work camp in Ramallah, a town near Jerusalem.  The idea was to get an international cast (some through Beirut) mixing with local Palestinians, and having some &quot;hard fun&quot; together, blasting this community swimming pool out of solid rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we moved to a kibbutz near Bethlehem and listened to guest speakers from the Knesset and so on.  This was 1972 (at the time of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chessclub.demon.co.uk/culture/worldchampions/fischer/fischer_spassky_match.htm&quot;&gt;Fischer vs. Spassky&lt;/a&gt;) and the situation hadn&#39;t yet deteriorated to the point it has now.  Even then, it was hard to get Israelis and Palestinians to do anything fun together, and only the internationals were able to immerse themselves in both camps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a 14 year old, this was all very educational, plus breaking those rocks with a sledge hammer, wheel-barrowing them to a discard pile, eating goat, ice cream at Rukab&#39;s, had made me more muscular, like Paul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another Paul story:  we were walking along &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/machine-world.html&quot;&gt;Viale Parioli&lt;/a&gt; one day, with Trisha-the-dog, when a car slammed into another one and flipped over, right near us.  I stood dumbfounded, slowly processing what had just happened.  Paul, on the other hand, shouted &quot;hold this!&quot; (the dog&#39;s leash) and immediately ran to the flipped car, to see if he might be of assistance.  I was thinking &quot;wow, and he&#39;s only in eighth grade.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve lost touch with Paul.  Mahlon phoned me some years ago, now with American Express.  I flew over Ramallah this morning, looking for the swimming pool, but couldn&#39;t get my bearings.  I never saw it finished.  By the start of 9th grade, I was in Bradenton, Florida at Southeast High, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/high-school-memorabilia.html&quot;&gt;the Philippines&lt;/a&gt; soon to follow.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115281378867502871'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115281378867502871'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/eighth-grade.html' title='Eighth Grade'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115247693648346990</id><published>2006-07-09T13:51:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:58.414-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Gym Jive</title><content type='html'>I finally got to the new &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;24 Hour Fittness&lt;/span&gt; (open 24 hours) and sampled the you-powered rides.

Plus I think taking advantage of this next level of technology, to better integrate what have been bitterly opposed enemies in earlier times, would add to the long term health and sustainability of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-re-public-education.html&quot;&gt;USA OS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not blind to the low living standard conditions which afflict both the bases and the territories in different ways.  At CUE, I worked adjacent to an office studying the AIDS epidemic among tribal networks, which often extend into desperate and miserable urban areas, blind eyed by DC (and often at war with the local police force).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needle sharing is a primary cause of all kinds of spreading.  Addressing the issue of drug abuse, and through strategems other than externalizing costs into an already overloaded penal system, should be high on the agenda of any who call themselves a &quot;nation,&quot; yet have so many invisibly suffering sisters and brothers in dramatically improvable scenarios.  Adding &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/dignity-village.html&quot;&gt;dignity village&lt;/a&gt; type prototyping would likewise add hope and relevance to some very salvageable careers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recruiting and training will happen differently depending on where we&#39;re focused.  I expect many veterans will feel led to the interbase circuit, in partial overlap with our interrez circuit.  The gnu math teacher memos look at the generic cybervan to public school interface quite a bit, with the &quot;public&quot; in &quot;public school&quot; and &quot;open&quot; in &quot;open source&quot; having a lot of resonance, and even more so this word &quot;freedom&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gnu math is about freeing individuals to explore and enjoy their metaphysical heritage, whatever it might be.

Best wishes to the nice man on selling that thing (an &#39;84 Falcon, minus working A/C except when plugged into AC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d rent one commercially except Portland is apparently not an attractive market for camper van rental companies, which seem to be few and far between (renting a big honkin&#39; RV is easy, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m wanting to drive -- too confining, as to where it might go).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we&#39;ll probably just take Razz on the next outing, as time is short to try scaring up another rental opportunity.  And of course in the long run, I&#39;m just hoping my school will let me book time through a dispatcher, as one of several certified to operate the fleet&#39;s motorvehicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other neighbors are having a block party, meaning they got enough signatures from affected households (including ours) to operate the city&#39;s &quot;access denial&quot; powers, vis-a-vis cars, of specific blocks, as when a party is happening, as is happening today, this being the Fourth of July and all, when we celebrate our independence to stage such mundane and pedestrian events, a form of independence we really shouldn&#39;t just take for granted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some future distopia might forbid ever closing back streets to cars, because cars are just too important (or by extension, the people in them).  These kinds of class distinctions are insidious, and once they work their way onto the law books, they rarely come off individually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By one definition, a conservative is someone who hates to delete laws, even ugly ones. These folks are often just cowed by seeing a law in writing, and can&#39;t bear to think of themselves as powerful enough to stand up to such things (there&#39;s a long history of bowing down to various writings).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another kind of conservative counts every law as a strike against freedom, and aims to keep their number as low as possible, even while keeping social nets workable -- which is more my kind of conservative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the rules are simple and easy, then everyone has a better shot at understanding them, which is more democratic.  Once the rules become riddled with exceptions and deceptions, then you&#39;re implying a secretive elite pulling the strings -- a form of decay from a healthier and more democratic state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Addendum&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We watched the fireworks from the deck of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Wave Dancer&lt;/span&gt;, anchored in the Columbia off &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Island&quot;&gt;Hayden Island&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portlandspirit.com/spirtech.php&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Portland Spirit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; passed us in the night.

Matrices get into the act.  But where&#39;s the &quot;number theory&quot; here?  &quot;Isn&#39;t this all &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;group theory&lt;/span&gt; then?&quot; (quivering chin, indignation) .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, but there&#39;s a hidden bridge, like in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Uru&lt;/span&gt;.  Twixt group theory and number theory we have these little groups and fields modulo N.  Extract the totients of a number (if prime, it&#39;ll be everyone lower -- real &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bartleby.com/59/4/primadonna.html&quot;&gt;prima donnas&lt;/a&gt; those primes), and intermultiply them modulo that number.  Woah hoah: those little doggies got Closure, Associative, Inverts, and Neutrality (CAIN -- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christiananswers.net/dictionary/cain.html&quot;&gt;some Biblical allusion&lt;/a&gt; I didn&#39;t invent (got it from a colleague)).  And if modulus N is a prima donna (a prime), then throw in addition, and you&#39;ve got CAIN in two operators, plus a distributive principle, a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Galois.html&quot;&gt;Galois&lt;/a&gt; field (I hear he was a chick magnet -- unconfirmed), suitable for study by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/flash/group.html&quot;&gt;elementary school students&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that was coming back over the bridge, from number theory (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/Jlang.html#5&quot;&gt;totatives&lt;/a&gt; are the positive integers relatively prime to N, but smaller i.e. no in-common factors but 1 -- a number&#39;s totient, an attribute, is &quot;how many&quot; of said totatives it has (if p is prime, phi(p) == p-1 (this phi, which I&#39;ve seen attributed to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/rsa-using-pythonic-notation.html&quot;&gt;Euler&lt;/a&gt;, is a name collision with the golden mean, another meaning for the same lowercase greek letter))).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s another pun lurking here, again not my invention:  CAIN reminds us of Abel in the Bible, and a pioneer of group theory is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Henrik_Abel&quot;&gt;Abel&lt;/a&gt;, such that if you not only have Associativity (a(bc)=(ab)c), but Commutativity as well (ab == ba), then your group is described as Abelian.  The maths are full of such jokes, which is why the hackers&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/gnu-math-on-synergeo.html&quot;&gt;Gnu Math&lt;/a&gt; is such a good fit.  We get one anothers&#39; jokes, sometimes at least.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115169191203529879'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115169191203529879'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/group-theory.html' title='Group Theory'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
