Sometimes I drive around Oregon imagining where the campus facilities might go.&amp;nbsp; Something that&#39;s part of a wind farm and already hooked up to take care of power generating, makes it useful to staff from the start.&amp;nbsp; Add cultural radio (mixed bag).&amp;nbsp; If there&#39;s anyone in radius that is (sometimes I&#39;m far off the grid, in ranch country -- you&#39;ll still have windmills though, if along the Columbia Gorge).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you go back in my blogs and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/fintech-for-social-responsibility-9230e5e1be58&quot;&gt;on Medium&lt;/a&gt;, you&#39;ll see where my head is at, as some kind of Sam Hill principal in some School of Tomorrow (experimental, prototype).&amp;nbsp; But would my expensing all that driving as &quot;for business&quot; make sense?&amp;nbsp; In a Quaker Meeting sense it might.&amp;nbsp; Warm Springs reservation was on my circuit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I talk more about casinos in &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2019/02/casino-math.html&quot;&gt;Casino Math&lt;/a&gt;, obviously.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s a topic area in my Digital Math curriculum, established on Wikieducator and then put into practice (experimental, prototype) here and there, with willing risk takers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
People who march off to camp to try something new may be risk takers.&amp;nbsp; What needs testing might not be weapons of war, in my Civilian Service scenario, but in terms of getting outdoorsy, there&#39;s lots of overlap.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Math is an Outdoor Sport&quot; say my virtual billboards.&amp;nbsp; Using GPS and/or following a treasure map, takes some trigonometry.&lt;br /&gt;

I&#39;ve been doing fly throughs of neurobiology on Youtube, the better to stimulate my hypertoon receptors.

Nice history around Nick! A sad tale in a lot of ways. I remember one time I was trying to help find Nick a place to crash and I felt like I couldn&#39;t let him stay at my place because my landlord in Bolinas CA was pretty concerned with strangers coming around being in Bolinas so Nick ended up asking me just to drop him off basically along the side of the road headed to Petaluma. It was bitter cold that night and in retrospect I can&#39;t believe I left him to sleep under the stars on such a night but I did. Sorry Nick. It was nice of you to give him a crash pad when he was in Portland. However, Nick was incredibly strong. He used to hitchhike around with an enormous number of heavy bags (probably full of books) and his dulcimer which I never heard him play. The world knocked him around but he was a tough dude. Definitely not the lifestyle for your run of the mill road scholar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

I picked Nick up hitchhiking the day before Thanksgiving 1988. Candy invited him to come for Thanksgiving dinner. He came by the next day and was a fixture in our lives until the day he died. I still remember driving home on Naito in Portland and fielding the call for theHillsboro police informing me Nick had died. In August under a blue moon rising over the hill in Pacific City I put his ashes in the ocean. The wind kicked up and I ended up inhaling a good bit of his remains. Blessings on him. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TP_2Zxr3CQM&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn and I hopped a bus 14 to join Portland State faculty and students at a brown bag lunch event.&amp;nbsp; We call it that, but no one was eating that I can recall.&amp;nbsp; We sandwiched into the Harder House meeting room, pretty much every seat taken, John Driscoll standing and delivering his presentation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John took full advantage of his time, launching early into preliminary material about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HausdorffDimension.html&quot;&gt;Hausdorff Dimension&lt;/a&gt; as computed with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Hausdorff+box+counting&quot;&gt;a &quot;box counting&quot; algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Applied to facades, or floor plans, generic grids, one may compute its fractional dimension d, or, conversely, create such vistas with d as input.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What would it mean to extrapolate random buildings within a fractal space, determined by a few hyperparameters?&amp;nbsp; John is &lt;a href=&quot;http://johncdriscoll.com/2019/03/12/pin-up-2-2/&quot;&gt;exploring this question&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Could such a font of detailed fractal structures provide a kind of clay, which an architect could then sculpt?&amp;nbsp; Iteratively?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given my obsession with &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/thinking-globally-in-2016-f01cd34466a6&quot;&gt;spherical planet simulations&lt;/a&gt;, my imaginary invisible landscape was of city-like planets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What if Roman Civilization were to be spread, by algorithmic generators, to create realistic vistas of cities never built?&amp;nbsp; Where would the aqueducts go?&amp;nbsp; Portland has some, from Bull Run.&amp;nbsp; The terminal reservoirs were Roman-Victorian in flavor.&amp;nbsp; I haunt the ones on Mt. Tabor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now try another civilization.&amp;nbsp; Add or subtract a technology.&amp;nbsp; The models would seem crude perhaps, yet educational.&amp;nbsp; Start with a river valley.&amp;nbsp; Now picture it urbanized.&amp;nbsp; Let the computer do the work, under the supervision of those with a strong sense of Feng Shui.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m always in classrooms where the students want to enter into a multi-user domain together, while they&#39;re all in the same room.&amp;nbsp; The game development platforms we use don&#39;t allow for this, but the competing commercial platforms do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My math teacher brain, in the meantime, is thinking &quot;why not harness this desire to socialize through game playing (remember bridge? remember card games?) and let us play something closer to &lt;i&gt;SimEarth&lt;/i&gt;?&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was a real game by the way, in addition to &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; In &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt;, we got to think about power plants, grids, city taxes, city services, property values and so on.&amp;nbsp; What would &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/12/wanderers-2009128.html&quot;&gt;a Henry George version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;i&gt;SimCity&lt;/i&gt; be like I wonder?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John has a kind of Machine Learning dynamic going, wherein software tools generate building after building, or block after block, with humans, perhaps licensed architects, registering aesthetic preferences.&amp;nbsp; &quot;I like this one better than that&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this way, human judgement and algorithm-developed architectures each play to their own strengths.&amp;nbsp; Algorithms generate a cornucopia of possibilities.&amp;nbsp; Human judges cull the field, leaving only a few noteworthy finalists.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Machine Learning algorithms know how to reshape themselves based on feedback, in the form of some error function to be minimized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The idea that architects and movie directors could interact with fractal generator city simulators sounds completely realistic if we&#39;re talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/03/portland-pacific-rim-center.html&quot;&gt;the movie industry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You want to fly around on such planets, but not necessarily build them, nor even draw them by hand.&amp;nbsp; They provide context.&amp;nbsp; They provide game boards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John and a long time colleague joined us afterward for lunch at Rogue Hall (Ione Building), part of Rogue Nation (the brewery). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I took many pictures and was looking forward to folding them into &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/03/portland-pacific-rim-center.html&quot;&gt;a next Youtube&lt;/a&gt; (I&#39;ve been doing them daily), only to find out my SD card was acting up.&amp;nbsp; The computer wouldn&#39;t read it, nor would the camera after that.&amp;nbsp; Unusual.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I ended up reformatting, losing all the pictures.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, John&#39;s colleague &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/vp5OZ7P5t7I&quot;&gt;got it all on video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&quot;Ammo for Philo&quot; sounds like a contradiction, as &quot;Philo&quot; means love and is short also for &quot;Philosophy&quot; or &quot;love of knowledge&quot;.&amp;nbsp; The &quot;sophy&quot; comes from &quot;sophia&quot; as does &quot;sofa&quot; (I made up &quot;sofa&quot; but I&#39;m thinking of a kind of love seat where two are engaged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The loner philosopher, perhaps a hermit, is stereotypically (and archetypically) not completely alone, but in a relationship with an otherness we might call Sophia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They named an robotic doll &quot;Sophia&quot; recently, and made her famous.&amp;nbsp; The of course there&#39;s the movie &lt;i&gt;Her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, I&#39;m eager to get away from all male or all white when we talk philosophy, though I want to stay inclusive of same.&amp;nbsp; For starters, &lt;i&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/i&gt; (important in my syllabus) is dedicated to three women:&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marilyn Ferguson, author of &lt;i&gt;The Aquarian Conspiracy&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Margaret Fuller, a Transcendentalist and contemporary of Thoreau (and Poe); and&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Barbara Marx Hubbard, for whom my dad volunteer, briefly, when she ran for the Office of the Vice President (US).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Speaking of cliches and stereotypes, there&#39;s been this common wisdom that the US vice presidency is a mostly ceremonial position, right up there with First Lady.&amp;nbsp; Would people say First Dude in the case of a married-to-a-man president?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not that First Guy or Gal is a fluff job either, but it&#39;s not constitutionally defined am I right?&amp;nbsp; A president is not required to have a spouse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, in the case of the Veep having a nothing job, that was pure deception:&amp;nbsp; it&#39;s a covert operations gig, most typically.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2019/02/journal-entry-on-racism.html&quot;&gt;Dick Cheney&lt;/a&gt; was not the first to stove pipe or traffic in state secrets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hubbard was pretty brave in running for that office directly, hoping a wannabe prez would pick her (I think she was hoping for John Glenn as a running mate, based on their mutual love the the space program).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My &lt;a href=&quot;http://4dsolutions.net/ocn&quot;&gt;Oregon Curriculum Network&lt;/a&gt; is just a storefront, not even a nonprofit.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s what I do as a business, with any time/energy I have left over, and then some.&amp;nbsp; I get no tax breaks for it, as I never tried to make it a standalone nonprofit.&amp;nbsp; I pay it (in the sense of fund it), not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The OCN has been pumping out these videos, and in the philosophy department the theme is the foundations of mathematics, in connection with what a certain dead poet society considered a breakthrough, a gear shift, and game changer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Professional mathematicians were cool to the whole idea and the society went underground, there to be discovered by the Religious Society of Friends, in the person of yours truly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The RSoF already looked at &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/general-systems-theory.html&quot;&gt;Kenneth Boulding&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/01/rufus-jones-luminious-life-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Rufus Jones&lt;/a&gt; as heroes (more white guys).&amp;nbsp; The former was a pioneer of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst1.html&quot;&gt;General Systems Theory&lt;/a&gt; while the later helped get American Friends Service Committee off the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rufus Jones was connected to Haverford, a college founded by Quakers in Pennsylvania (Penn himself being Quaker, and the state named after him at one time envisaged as a kind of Quaker utopia).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, OCN also brainstormed CSN (&lt;a href=&quot;https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Coffee Shops Network&lt;/a&gt;), another &quot;faux business&quot; in the sense that it couches its philanthropic model in the form of a science fictional network of coffee shops.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Would I like this network to exist for real?&amp;nbsp; Of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CSN is a puzzle piece that helps fund some of the other puzzle pieces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what&#39;s the &quot;ammo&quot; I&#39;m talking about?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My hopes for philosophy have to do with its relevance.&amp;nbsp; In a world where religion proves divisive, might philosophy provide bridges?&amp;nbsp; We don&#39;t have to agree about what or whom is divine before coming to grips with the prospects for humanity (one of Bucky&#39;s favorite topics).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have colorful polyhedrons, high definition screens, and a wealth of worthy themes.&lt;br /&gt;

Synergetics Hypertoons may not be a reality in your zip code just yet, but that can&#39;t stop you from sharing in the dream, regardless of gender or genetic profile.&lt;/div&gt;

Does anyone still call it that, the &quot;blogosphere&quot; I mean?&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere&quot;&gt;Wikipedia has an entry&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; We wouldn&#39;t call the term &quot;dated&quot; yet would we?&amp;nbsp; The notion of &quot;blog&quot; itself is pretty recent, and bloggers still abound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I like how the term has &quot;spheric&quot; in it, which describes &quot;a land without borders&quot; as in &quot;never coming to the edge&quot;.&amp;nbsp; A world that abruptly ended, at some cliff or river, would be not a sphere in that sense.&amp;nbsp; A sphere lets you stumble every which way, and still be on it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of stumbling around the planet, I read and watched about the summit meeting in Hanoi, twixt the DC civilian team and DPRK.&amp;nbsp; I was happy enough with some side results to not be especially disappointed with a holding status quo.&amp;nbsp; Part of how nation-states establish their longevity is by moving at a glacial pace.&amp;nbsp; Be the hour hand.&amp;nbsp; Live forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deeper things are going on in Korea that outsiders will appreciate, is what I&#39;m thinking.&amp;nbsp; What Americans think and do about Korea is not what matters, or at least that&#39;s how it should be.&amp;nbsp; Americans should feel so relieved when the weight of the world is finally off their shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is it because Plymouth Rock was all about Puritans, or for other reasons, that Americans are so prudish?&amp;nbsp; We burn through presidents on the basis of their peccadilloes quite a lot in seems to me.&amp;nbsp; The home folks want morality plays, another term for soap opera.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Congress is seeing new potential there, in hold highly televised hearings.&amp;nbsp; Are we finally getting somewhere, in terms of stirring voters out of their apathy?&amp;nbsp; The Kavanaugh hearings were like a pilot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand:&amp;nbsp; the heroic partisans aren&#39;t really that offended by what&#39;s outwardly touted as the sin, but the less superficial reasons can&#39;t be prosecuted.&amp;nbsp; We keep it shallow on purpose and so on.&amp;nbsp; Didn&#39;t people vote for a playboy, a Hugh Hefner type?&amp;nbsp; That was a way to reassert a kind of male dominant prowess no?&amp;nbsp; Hawkish Hillary wasn&#39;t that different in some ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Forgive me if I get bored.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m just thinking we could have a lot funner planet with different screenwriting.&amp;nbsp; I didn&#39;t really like soap operas either.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They say it&#39;s not really about sex outside of marriage (with Clinton either, or with Kennedys), but the lying.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve grown up with presidents lying all my life.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s what they do.&amp;nbsp; So?&amp;nbsp; Goes with the territory.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prohibition is and was interesting.&amp;nbsp; When government aims to be &quot;secular&quot; that&#39;s a way of saying the different ethnicities can regulate &quot;what&#39;s moral&quot; to some degree, that&#39;s not our business.&amp;nbsp; If your religion says it&#39;s OK to drink alcohol, then go for it -- as long as you&#39;re not a legal minor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But this hands off attitude only goes so far, as we&#39;ve seen, and the boundaries keep changing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Secularism includes the idea of rules, and therefore of breaking them.&amp;nbsp; But does one follow rules to be &quot;good&quot;?&amp;nbsp; Does one play chess for the halo?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marriage is a secular institution as well as a religious one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of which (screenwriting), Patrick was full of great ideas today, regarding how Truckers for Peace (an academic program) might model itself after massage therapists who do the same thing (swap jobs and places to stay).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which reminds me, I thought a genius piece of the Standard est Training was the &quot;needs a ride or place to stay&quot; segment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Uh oh, I&#39;m likely to veer into Scientology next.&amp;nbsp; Talk about segues.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right when the Academy Awards were on, it turned out later, I was back in the old feud between the British BBC guy and the various factions of this powerful church, catching up on the movies (genre: documentary, expose).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;ve gotta admit, it&#39;s a pretty gripping drama with all the elements, including families split down the middle, at the highest levels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When will someone run for US president with Scientologist on their resume?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My rude and crude Youtubes (I&#39;m proud of some of them) keep me cycling through the Virus Meme, somewhat by design.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll do another Medium story on that maybe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been contributing more Youtubes (U2oobs) to the meme pool.&amp;nbsp; I mentioned some recent ones &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2019-March/012067.html&quot;&gt;on edu-sig&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I collect them &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/02/viral-videos.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and there in my blogs.&lt;/div&gt;

As it turns out, the weather was pretty normal, after the morning flurries.&amp;nbsp; But we didn&#39;t know that would happen waking up.&amp;nbsp; I woke up early, to an email from the auto mechanic very conveniently allowing me to reschedule.&amp;nbsp; Sure, why not?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was up early because of time zones again.&amp;nbsp; Not the first time.&amp;nbsp; We in the on-line economy, when doing synchronous meetings, need to adjust for the global economy staying awake, somewhere, 24/7.&amp;nbsp; This was a follow-up appointment, having established the only remaining glitches were client-side.&amp;nbsp; This morning&#39;s meetup went off without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, with snow coming down, the street already white, I wasn&#39;t about to rush out to have my door lock inspected.&amp;nbsp; My car is a junker (meant affectionately, and not out of disrespect to a still strong engine) and shows wear and tear everywhere.&amp;nbsp; Remember &lt;i&gt;Columbo&lt;/i&gt; with Peter Falk?&amp;nbsp; I think my car is nicer than his at least.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ll be getting back around to that soon though.&amp;nbsp; To postpone owing to snow is not to neglect, at least not in Portland.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re allowed to take snow days.&amp;nbsp; The district schools were all closed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had an assignment in a district school yesterday.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s a lot bureaucratic going on, in addition to all the Python learning.&amp;nbsp; I sent a note to the parents, reminding them of what we&#39;re doing around Codesters, an adaptation of the Python language that runs well in the browser.&amp;nbsp; These are middle schoolers and I&#39;m not expecting them to have the same wishes around how to spend time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Deke told me yesterday was Personal Chef Day, and that I am for my mom.&amp;nbsp; She does a pretty routine diet, thanks to the &quot;food is medicine&quot; mantra, and her pills interact with all the rest of it.&amp;nbsp; That makes the work easier.&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s able to fend for herself to a point, if need be.&amp;nbsp; And she&#39;ll want you to know:&amp;nbsp; she&#39;s not the only one known to leave a burner on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have I talked about Tulsi Gabbard yet?&amp;nbsp; The candidate for US president.&amp;nbsp; I remember:&amp;nbsp; I started a draft on Medium, but don&#39;t regard it as pithy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/friendly-musings-on-national-politics-8e62f6d51006&quot;&gt;probably won&#39;t publish it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In general I think like an &lt;i&gt;Atlantic Monthly&lt;/i&gt; of some months ago, that the job of POTUS has become too undoable, in terms of demands and responsibilities.&amp;nbsp; As a consequence, I&#39;m finding myself not wishing that office on anyone, as too cruel and unusual.&amp;nbsp; Tulsi deserves better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An emperor-president is too oxymoronic a notion, we&#39;ve been finding that out more and more over time.&amp;nbsp; The screenwriting just isn&#39;t believable.&amp;nbsp; The illusions have worn too thin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Political bubbles have popped before.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not scapegoating here.&amp;nbsp; No one president has brought about this state of affairs and indeed many of fought it, in ways we don&#39;t (and probably won&#39;t ever) know about.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of the job of POTUS, the scandal lights were flashing big time today as the public learned more about the personal wheelings and dealings of their chief executive, from his former lawyer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The broad outlines of the story have been public for months.&amp;nbsp; However, the full circus potential of the scandal had not been exploited, in the manner of the Kavanaugh hearings, until this morning.&amp;nbsp; I was blissfully oblivious, until my daily briefing from one of my TV hound friends.&amp;nbsp; I did some catching up later, having decided to stay put.&lt;br /&gt;

We
 can celebrate the expressiveness and adaptability of the human genome 
without buying in to the specific taxonomy of races invented mostly by 
white supremacist social Darwinists with an agenda to justify 
imperialism and/or slavery.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The racists use animal husbandry 
for their concepts, wanting to identify humans as either &quot;pure 
specimens&quot; of this or that breed (race), or &quot;mongrels&quot; (hybrids, mi&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;xed
 race).  We could go much further in this direction if we wanted, with 
&quot;Best in Show&quot; specimens of whatever pure breeds the authorities decided
 to enshrine, perhaps inventing new races as time goes on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In 
the meantime, racists forge ahead without any universally agreed upon 
taxonomy.  It all keeps changing, and &quot;race&quot; gets hopelessly confused 
with &quot;ethnicity&quot; which is different.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t see genetic 
differences (and/or ethnic ones), I just have little respect for the 
pseudo-anthropology that pretends to see a clear and clean taxonomy. A 
lot of academic white guys with snobby attitudes want to tell me, 
another white guy, what the races are.  Are there five or seven?  What 
are they again?  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Their answers always sound stupid to me, from
 pretentiously pseudo-educated college and university types with a cave 
man&#39;s understanding of the world.  I can&#39;t credit racists with any kind 
of intellectual integrity.  They&#39;re a morally bankrupt camp and yes a 
lot of them have white skin and academic degrees.  I consider racists 
inferior, intellectually, in so many ways.  To believe in races is an 
ethnic trait.  Not everyone suffers from that specific meme virus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 thanks to the original poster for starting this useful thread. I hope 
we keep revisiting racism for as long as it takes. Ashley Montagu

The term &quot;staggerers&quot; jokingly derives from &quot;wanderers&quot;, what we call ourselves, I think mostly for the wandering nature of our group meetups.&amp;nbsp; The conversation flits from topic to topic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not claiming we&#39;re unique like that.&amp;nbsp; When adults gather at dinner or cocktail parties, you note similar stream of consciousness chit chat.&amp;nbsp; We practice democracy in having inclusive conversations that give people frequent opportunities to change the subject if they wish to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In other modes, we keep things more organized, even ritualized if in the realm of religion, legal rites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Secular institutions are not without ritual.&amp;nbsp; But I wander.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;To stagger&quot; in this context means to walk in a halting fashion, not gracefully.&amp;nbsp; However we&#39;re speaking metaphorically and just poking fun at ourselves.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t expect it&#39;s a term that will catch on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m reminded of &quot;Quakers&quot; as by some accounts the term had the spin of a insult.&amp;nbsp; Without a time machine, it&#39;s no simple matter to recreate the psyche of a 1700s England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our youngest participant had suffered the most dire healthcare chapter lately, in terms of acuity. I remember my bout with appendicitis just out of college, staying with friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We gathered at my place, Carol gamely lurking in on the conversation, in the living room, where pizza was had.&amp;nbsp; We also have an upstairs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can see the place through my Oregon Curriculum Network website, where I use a Google Street View of it.&amp;nbsp; I think of myself as a for-profit business that funds a nonprofit, which is my work to uplift education practices in Oregon.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m far from being expert in all such practices.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m here to learn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of learning, Don helped me tune in the Sallie Tisdale corpus.&amp;nbsp; I bought her book on female Buddhist personages, for Kindle.&amp;nbsp; That was but a couple hours ago and I haven&#39;t studied it yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David had a pinkish shirt with the NASA logo.&amp;nbsp; He used to work there.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve got other blog posts about Dr. DiNucci.&amp;nbsp; Wanderers meet in the old Linus Pauling House in Asylum District.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ve been writing up many of the meetups in these blogs for over a decade by now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like what happens in many parties, gatherings, meetups, of an informal nature, if there&#39;s internet, speakers and screen, there&#39;s the possibility of dialing up (selecting) various video clips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The diner juke box is/was similar.&amp;nbsp; People take turns picking music.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s behavior that also traces to salons and parlors, developed as somewhat playful spaces by our Victorian ancestors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bob works as a nurse, these days on a night shift schedule.&amp;nbsp; He goes pretty far back in this blog, to an Esozone.&amp;nbsp; Don, a frequent visitor of Doug Strain, met Bob in his role as staff.&amp;nbsp; Bob is a jolly good fellow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My curriculum was web based, not textbook based, and not behind paywalls.&amp;nbsp; As of this writing, a lot of my pioneering, such as my &lt;a href=&quot;http://4dsolutions.net/ocn/numeracy0.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Numeracy Series&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is still there.&amp;nbsp; However by the time you read this, a lot of that stuff may have gone off-line.&amp;nbsp; I haven&#39;t gotten to a place with Oregon where I think my domains will be long term relevant going forward.&amp;nbsp; Cyber-tourism is still in its infancy.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A7kpzT8Sr5E&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;try it on x2 speed?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Per a recent blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/02/riddle-of-peace.html&quot;&gt;one of the Fuller Schoolers&lt;/a&gt; sent me a link to the Gutenberg Press version of an H.G. Wells piece.&amp;nbsp; Wells was attending a conference in Washington, D.C. in 1918, a gala affair with opening speeches by President Harding, aimed at heading off any more world wars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WW1 (as no one called it yet) had just ended.&amp;nbsp; Everyone was saying, how do we stop &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; from ever happening again?&amp;nbsp; Civilization was having a hard time recovering.&amp;nbsp; Wells wondered if the illness was terminal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our man on the scene, as if sent by time machine, does his best to raise the awareness level, as we might say today, and without any use of psychedelics (&lt;i&gt;Doors to Perception&lt;/i&gt;, by Aldous Huxley, came decades later).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&#39;s skeptical that even he, a well-anchored man, will be able to muster the necessary sobriety of spirit to help regain an even keel.&amp;nbsp; He notices he&#39;s too giddy, one might say hysterical.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s like a doctor walking among patients in a psychiatric ward, except we&#39;ve lost track of which are which.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Russia has just saved France&#39;s butt against the Germans, and is now not invited to the table, because of those mean Bolsheviks.&amp;nbsp; Yes they were mean, as were the Zionists (Wells doesn&#39;t mention those).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Germany was to repay everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lessons learned were in meanness, and vengefulnes, for the most part.&amp;nbsp; Kids realize it&#39;s cruelty that counts, which becomes like their rite of passage to the despair of adulthood.&amp;nbsp; We won&#39;t get bullied again.&amp;nbsp; Next time, it&#39;s our turn to be the bully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And what about Japan, with its population pressures?&amp;nbsp; Could it really afford to give up its designs on China, and would it, if no one else did?&amp;nbsp; H.G. Wells was thinking out loud (not unlike Bucky -- the two did meet, in another chapter).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ve already been through many generations of European imperialism and colonialism by this time, one could say back through Rome.&amp;nbsp; Like Mark Twain and Andrew Carnegie, Wells is far from infatuated with imperialism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In bringing up all these questions as a journalist, Wells was hoping to inspire deeper thought and more appropriate action on the part of his fellow planetarians.&amp;nbsp; He was doing the world a service, in sketching himself, the paradigm Englishman, in contrast to these impetuous Americans, and easy-to-get-along-with Chinese.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&#39;s taking risks, as well as helping to define his own character.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not through the whole work yet.&amp;nbsp; I saw the name &quot;Briand&quot; popping up here and there, and started wondering about &quot;Kellog&quot; as in &quot;Kellog-Briand Pact&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Would that Treaty be the outcome of this Washington based process work?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not immediately, for sure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That Treaty wasn&#39;t signed until 1928, and proved unenforceable against the warmongers (see embedded Youtube).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you get right down to it, the people who specialize in implements of torture and coercion, get to have their way quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We all live daily under the threat of nuclear annihilation, and will tend to obey that within ourselves that would put off that terrible conflagration.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Naturally there&#39;s push back against the warmongers, many of whom have already invested in reinforced bunkers.&amp;nbsp; The warmongers crave some proof they were right to be prepared, and stoke the self-fulfilling prophecy machine (the same siren songs, over and over).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Wonder Woman would learn in Humans 101, a demonic force is hiding behind humanity, a Lucifer (they used a different name), determined to make this place a living Hell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humanity sorely needs true defenders, and some pray for help from ETs.&amp;nbsp; I understand why a &lt;i&gt;deus ex machina&lt;/i&gt; might have some appeal around now.&amp;nbsp; We have this sense of needing rescuing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where&#39;s a mother ship when you need one?&amp;nbsp; Beam me up Scotty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the words of one of my favorite Martians: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In his preface to the 1941 edition of &lt;i&gt;The War in the Air&lt;/i&gt;, Wells had stated that his epitaph should be:&amp;nbsp; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I told you so. You &lt;i&gt;damned&lt;/i&gt; fools&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

You’re
 probably thinking of a lot of frustrating delays, and of MLK’s “I have a
 dream” speech. If you don’t know about MLK, you likely won’t recognize 
RBF either, though most will know JFK and USSR.&lt;/div&gt;

However,
 I’m thinking of a delay you may not be: the postponement of “smart” 
houses (I’m putting off a definition). Instead, the Big Promise has been
 “driverless cars” (aka “people movers” if you lived through the 1970s).&lt;/div&gt;

You
 may be wondering when “smart houses” were ever a dominant fantasy, in 
which case I’ll point you first to the DDU (Dymaxion Deployment Unit),

&lt;span data-offset-key=&quot;5vlkg-0-0&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-text=&quot;true&quot;&gt;I&#39;m sometimes called &quot;expat&quot; but that&#39;s when I was living outside the country (exterior to the homeland, where the &quot;pats&quot; or patriots live). I&#39;ve been &quot;back home&quot; (but not in Chicago) since the 1970s which is a long time ago, so nowadays I blend in as perfectly normal, except for the token Bob Dobbs face here and there (a symbol of my lingering abnormalcy, actually a badge as I&#39;m still proud of not being a &quot;pure&quot; homelander -- many in Congress have never seen much of the world, and it shows).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember &quot;people movers&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These were a staple at World&#39;s Fair type expos, wherein the public would be treated to preview what could be the norm but a decade hence.&amp;nbsp; The five and ten year horizons were conventionally bright, in those days, before science fiction got darker and more &quot;blade runny&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &quot;cars&quot; typically ran on tracks, like at theme parks, but were small and intimate enough for single parties or a family traveling together, the same anthro units as with private vehicles.&amp;nbsp; Some units were wheel chair accessible, at least on the drawing boards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However the reality was miles of asphalt and precious few train tracks to switch.&amp;nbsp; Everything family carriage like was parked in a garage and fed gas from a family budget.&amp;nbsp; How would we get to People Movers from there?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Answer:&amp;nbsp; make each car semi-autonomous enough to navigate its own way through the system, distributing the problem to its many nodes.&amp;nbsp; No central &quot;brain&quot; had to prevent collisions.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s every car for itself but not without cooperative features.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s needed are not phony farms where the cars get trained, after which they&#39;re injected into Las Vegas as taxis.&amp;nbsp; The better deal would be an experimental prototype community where people agreed to live, as prototypers.&amp;nbsp; None of the cars have drivers.&amp;nbsp; There is more of a central brain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might think I&#39;m talking about building from scratch, and I am, to an extent, but then I&#39;m thinking of the movie industry and its &quot;sets&quot;.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re not building &quot;forever cities&quot; so much as stocking &quot;prop inventory&quot; with more intelligent components we might use to &quot;throw together&quot; a city &quot;overnight&quot; as they say, or at least quickly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, we&#39;ll build New Rome in a day, as a publicity stunt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Consider Old Man River City for example.&amp;nbsp; We could have done some cartoons there at least, sparking young imaginations.&amp;nbsp; But we&#39;re afraid to screen positive futurism lest the whip fall across our backs, as management reminds us that &quot;rising expectations&quot; is a &quot;national security threat&quot; (no kidding).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The engineers in China have been showing off their ability to do cities from scratch.&amp;nbsp; What would it take to retrofit a few of these as Prototyping Zones?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re not running every experiment everywhere, and the participants are not kept clueless.&amp;nbsp; Interesting TV comes out of these places.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;re paid to live there, not out of pity for the poor or anything, but because prototyping is real work / study.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s risk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So am I just talking about Global U campus development per business as usual then?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes and no.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m reminding readers that conscious planning is required for these cities, and lots of training, meaning jobs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saying the money has just now run out on building cities after some 20K years and more is not going to make sense, so if there&#39;s a good reason for not moving forward with prototyping, make sure it&#39;s not that.&amp;nbsp; We see they&#39;ve been trying some stuff in various cities already.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/46009103944/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Phi Scaled S Module&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Phi Scaled S Module&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4847/46009103944_bda5a5f0c3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unaffected, at least superficially, by the partial government shutdown, is the Multnomah County Library system.&amp;nbsp; Portlanders prize their public library infrastructure and it does offer some gems, such as this maker space in the Rockwood neighborhood.&amp;nbsp; I drove out there on Sunday for some free assistance with my 3D printing project:&amp;nbsp; to create three sizes of S module (S, S phi up, and S phi down).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Starting with a professionally developed CAD file donated by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.c6xty.com/&quot;&gt;Flextegrity developer&lt;/a&gt;, we printed a left-handed S-module shell + lid, at 50% scale, as the first 3D printer we tried would not have been able to accommodate the 100% scale version.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, even after switching to a Lulzbot Taz with a bigger bed, we stuck with 50% as the home position.&amp;nbsp; From there, phi down is about 30.9% (50% times 0.618) while phi up is about 80.9% (50% times 1.618) of the original size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/46009097254/in/dateposted-public/&quot; title=&quot;Lulzbot Taz&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Lulzbot Taz&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4873/46009097254_334336f4fe.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the Youtubes explained, I&#39;d be going from STL files to slicer software such as Cura, which would create the route for the nozzle to squirt its goo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The smaller Lulzbot was loaded with glow-in-the-dark filament, which might&#39;ve been cool, however I was happy to go with the silver metallic look and the bigger bed.
&lt;br /&gt;

In case you&#39;re hazy about &lt;a href=&quot;https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/4dsolutions/MartianMath/blob/master/mm6.ipynb&quot;&gt;the so-called &quot;S module&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, that&#39;s a tetrahedron defined in &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/synergetics.html&quot;&gt;Synergetics: Explorations in the Geometry of Thinking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by R. Buckminster Fuller, which occupies a corner in American Literature.&lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;ve chosen the title of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/03/05/buckminster-fuller-education-automation-1962/&quot;&gt;one of Bucky Fuller&#39;s books&lt;/a&gt; for a blog post title.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Automation&quot; sounds cold, minus the warmth of human touch and attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For those who&#39;ve received a lot of grief from humans, mostly negative feedback, a little automation may be a godsend.&amp;nbsp; Household appliances have freed up many hours for time with family.&amp;nbsp; Without a posse of servants, a single human is able to keep up with a lot of tasks, even with one or more dependents.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, I&#39;m getting off topic.&amp;nbsp; I just saw the documentary &lt;i&gt;Waiting for Superman&lt;/i&gt; again and wanted to weigh in with fresh memories, and before I reread &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/01/waiting-for-superman-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;my blogged review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here&#39;s director Guggenheim giving Bill Gates and others a vehicle to express their vision, which is pro school choice, anti teacher union, pro merit pay, anti tenure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The myth (which has some truth in it, how much is a key question) that what&#39;s between life in poverty and a comfortable place in the professional classes, is &quot;a good education&quot; provides much of the premise for this film.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Define &quot;good&quot;?&amp;nbsp; Is it what rich people got?&amp;nbsp; Maybe not in all cases?&amp;nbsp; You can be a rich know-nothing with few skills and no ethical sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I&#39;m concerned about is students not having any management responsibilities over accounts and files in cyberspace, because they don&#39;t get a safe workplace.&amp;nbsp; Schools focus on herding from room to room, not scheduling quality time in study quarters. The &quot;safe study space home base&quot; (or PWS) become more the reality in college -- but why not before?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As an after school teacher, I drive around with a phone full of login credentials, sometimes Chromebooks, which I give out to my students.&amp;nbsp; These are for accessing such cloud-based learning platforms as MIT Scratch, Codesters, Animatron, Clara.io and Codepen.io.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re teaching a lot of techie stuff, but a lot of it&#39;s arty too.&amp;nbsp; Arty / techie is what some call &quot;design&quot; and with enough science:&amp;nbsp; &quot;design science&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Many generic skills.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back to Fuller (a master of &quot;design science&quot;):&amp;nbsp; he worked to counter the Protestant myth that we only deserve life support if we agree to do &quot;jobs&quot; for the owner classes, and that those without jobs are without merit and unentitled to any life support.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He supported minimum income philosophies, as a way to help keep us out of trouble.&amp;nbsp; Engineering could distribute the sun&#39;s munificence, according to some Food Not Bombs philosophy.&amp;nbsp; At least no one would go starving.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If all you do is work, when do we study, and if study is work, why isn&#39;t it paid (compensated)?&amp;nbsp; Shouldn&#39;t civilizations reward behaviors necessary for their own perpetuation?&amp;nbsp; One might think so.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When do parents get to stay home with their kids and learn skills together as a team?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using education systems to split parents from children in order to homogenize and dilute ethnic differences is likewise a big use of television.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A mixed use skyscraper or larger building is more like a village in that people get to sleep, eat, study, work, exercise, and so forth, without commuting across town.&amp;nbsp; Just take an elevator.&amp;nbsp; More like living on a &lt;i&gt;Starship Enterprise&lt;/i&gt; in some popular TV show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When schooling is better integrated into the local economy, with apprenticeships and part time roles, that can help too, in producing well-rounded individuals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saying you&#39;ve &quot;dropped out&quot; to serve as a cashier in a small family store (or on a military base), is pretty extreme.&amp;nbsp; We need systems that let you opt in and out easily over the course of a lifetime.&amp;nbsp; Some people don&#39;t see the value in education until they&#39;ve had more life experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting some work experience at a young age need not be some fateful decision that keeps you away from other opportunities forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want kids to have opportunities to read and write programs, manage websites, make movies, tend to databases (not only SQL) starting from whatever age they have the attention for it, a mental age more than a physical one.&amp;nbsp; But when do they get an opportunity?&amp;nbsp; I bring them login credentials.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Developing these skills usually means tending to a file tree somewhere, a software workbench, and also having a work/study environment relatively free of distractions, like we hope students have when doing homework.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kids need cubicles, study carrels, as much as the adults do.&amp;nbsp; All some get is a storage locker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lots of professionals, curriculum developers, engineers, have visions similar to Bucky&#39;s:&amp;nbsp; lets make advancing through a curriculum a paying proposition, even if only in terms of crypto-currencies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reward the work of study, with greater access to educational resources.&amp;nbsp; Compensation isn&#39;t always in terms of cold cash, much as anonymous currencies have proved, and will continue to prove, useful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What we need to set up are pilot projects, staffed and developed by people willing to &quot;eat their own dog food&quot; i.e. those designing the lifestyle also need to enroll in the programs to find out what it&#39;s like to experience various brands of &quot;education automation&quot; from the inside.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No one size fits all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets see some more sizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mine these blogs for ideas.&lt;br /&gt;

I&#39;m reminded of my road trips in Bhutan.&amp;nbsp; T4P or Truckers for Peace is about giving people in trucking more opportunities to share gigs and learn about different cultures for credit.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This morning I got to meet &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/pycon-2016-concludes.html&quot;&gt;Peter Farrell&lt;/a&gt; and his twin brother Steve at the local diner, &lt;i&gt;Tom&#39;s&lt;/i&gt;, for ongoing discussions about pedagogy (teaching kids) and andragogy (teaching adults).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Peter has just finished &lt;i&gt;Math Adventures with Python&lt;/i&gt; through No Starch Press and I&#39;ve been pouring over an electronic copy. The synergy of coding and doing mathematics is an obvious draw for a lot of us, whereas another school of thought (represented &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/forum.jspa?forumID=206&amp;amp;start=0&quot;&gt;on Forum 206&lt;/a&gt;) says coding and doing math should be kept far apart and tested separately.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The separatists pretty much won their battle, meaning the coding people have had to wedge their way, hour by hour, into K-16, without math curriculum writers and publishers lifting a finger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Their track, the math track, is just fine as is, whereas the coders needed to start over from scratch and often ended up focusing on &quot;games&quot; because they&#39;re trying to appeal to their new audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Against that default background, you&#39;ll find an assortment of creative teachers, left any freedom to innovate, will keep mixing it up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My hybrid blend goes by &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/scripting-road-show.html&quot;&gt;GNU Math&lt;/a&gt;&quot; sometimes, deliberately a pun on New Math (we do look at sets, but maybe not as a be all end all ala Bertrand Russell), given Stallman&#39;s encouragement of wordplay and cleverness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wikieducator.org/Digital_Math&quot;&gt;Digital Math&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is another name for it.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve had a lot of discussion of the genre over the years, in Forum 206 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/&quot;&gt;on edu-sig&lt;/a&gt; (@Python.org).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the middle of &lt;i&gt;Digital Math&lt;/i&gt;, I draw this arching bridge over the STEM-PATH chasm (cite C.P. Snow), into literature and anthropology.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Imagine a tribe&quot; (as Wittgenstein would say) &quot;which &quot;multiplication&quot; means this different thing&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We already have multiple meanings for &quot;the product of&quot; in the world of binary operations (two complex numbers, two matrices...), so my injecting some alternative sixty-degree-based geometric model of multiplying, from American literature, scarcely makes a ripple. Said operation (__mul__ in Python) is already over-determined.&amp;nbsp; What&#39;s one more meaning?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, I&#39;m not suggesting every secular (public or charter) and private school needs to include American literature.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/uncommon-core-87a31b7f75b3&quot;&gt;a niche&lt;/a&gt;, and features such expats as Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, back to Walt Whitman and before (Coleridge&#39;s romanticism informs both pragmatism and transcendentalism, and whatever Poe was into &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka:_A_Prose_Poem&quot;&gt;with &lt;i&gt;Eureka&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and so on).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We see &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/graphing-the-poets-b600c86d6b9&quot;&gt;this graph of connecting authors&lt;/a&gt; against a wartime backdrop a lot of the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Studying poets, such as Bucky, takes us into History (the H in PATH) pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Math Adventures with Python&lt;/i&gt; leverages having powerful CPUs and GPUs at our disposal.&amp;nbsp; The halcyon days of the scientific calculator are in the recent past.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mathematica&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;Wolfram Language&lt;/i&gt;, operates in the same domain as GNU Math a lot, and much of the PR from Wolfram&#39;s corner fits with the larger &quot;learning math through programming&quot; campaign&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;[Jimmy] Dore&#39;s view is &quot;yes Russians 
troll, so does everyone doing net stuff&quot; and to gain a following you 
start dealing in juicy memes, becoming one of the thought leaders somehow 
(who knows how, that&#39;s where the &quot;research&quot; comes in; Cambridge 
Analytica had their OCEAN etc.).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Then when you have a following you can 
spam them for business reasons i.e. sell advertising (turn around to 
companies and say &quot;you pay me and I&#39;ll tell my following about your 
thing&quot;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Whereas DNCers see Internet Research Agency dealing in 
political memes with an agenda to tip the election, the Dore crowd see 
&quot;business as usual&quot; where oligarchy is concerned, and which the Russian 
mafia plays along with everybody else, with more interest in getting or 
staying rich than in trying to directly play &quot;king of the White House&quot; 
(just be sure you have some access once the slug fest is over -- what an
 embassy is for).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;That&#39;s pretty much my view too: there&#39;s no need to 
risk exposure (e.g. FBI detection) hacking federal elections machinery, 
when social media already provide a legal means to play mind games with 
the public.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;I believe Russians &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/polysci-a-look-back-at-russiagate-b34e08bb9383&quot;&gt;actively engage in social media&lt;/a&gt;, most 
definitely, and echo the DNI report in saying RT is up on its game.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Wow, they&#39;re not kidding at Steemit, when they say keep track of your own damn password. A lotta geeks dismiss that one, knowing reset with verification is a possibility, meaning you can just reset the password once you have the victim&#39;s cell phone.&amp;nbsp; Not so with this blockchainer.&amp;nbsp; You don&#39;t have the password in memory, which is too long to remember, and you don&#39;t get to reset it if you forget it.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll never access your account again, another waste of a great moniker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was pdx4d.&amp;nbsp; They generate the passwords for you.&amp;nbsp; They look like bitcoin addresses.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;re getting warmer.&amp;nbsp; I did find where I&#39;d backed up the Steemit address, having followed protocol.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Steemit is but one of many social media the next geek generation has cooked up.&amp;nbsp; You weren&#39;t expecting the world to stop with Facebook were you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m using Facebook, as it&#39;s not either/or, but as a columnist in Bizmo World, I&#39;m expected to keep pushing to a next horizon.&amp;nbsp; Have you signed on to Meat yet?&amp;nbsp; Just kidding.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets make it real here and talk about malls.&amp;nbsp; Sears Discount is suffering from low attendance, another reason to go in, great customer service.&amp;nbsp; They had their two models of microwave ovens at really low prices, but with a Walmart right next door (next store), that wasn&#39;t saying much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I came in like a robot, checked the LG, had my measuring tape, ended up with the Oster, about the same price but more swoopy or something.&amp;nbsp; Walmart had some other things I needed.&amp;nbsp; Then Fubonn, the Asian supermarket complex.&amp;nbsp; More ramen.&amp;nbsp; Kimchi.&amp;nbsp; Couldn&#39;t find the soy sauce, will solve it next time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Portland&#39;s 82nd Avenue, an Oregon State road, is our homage to freeway gentrification everywhere, except it&#39;s not the freeway, but the business route running north-south parallel to I-205, itself the business route branch-off of I-5, that goes through the center, branching to I-405 to the super-center.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By &quot;freeway gentrification&quot; I mean the strip mall culture of one-story restaurant franchises and assortment of big and little box stores, supplied by truck, the premier vehicle of the I-net, from a layer of warehouses around any hub city, especially those with ports.&amp;nbsp; Portland has humble freight traffic, and that keeps us connected in a global economy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may be wondering what bizmo rig I&#39;m driving through all these parking lots and you&#39;d be right to be wondering, since a bizmo log or chronicle typically features such a vehicle, with its quirks and problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead, I&#39;m in a four-door Nissan from the late 1900s.&amp;nbsp; Long time readers of these blogs may remember Razz, a Subaru, and Robin Blue even before that.&amp;nbsp; Cars get proper names much as we give variable names to other features in a program, including actors, agents, whatever observables.&amp;nbsp; Mars has a name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The archetypal bizmo shimmers in the archetypal landscape, between the lines, as we&#39;re still busy constructing the lifestyle.&amp;nbsp; T4P only came along recently.&amp;nbsp; For now, I&#39;m just blending in as one more noodle lover.&amp;nbsp; The Oster is working great, and sensed by itself when the baked potato had released sufficient humidity.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s some real science going on in that appliance.&amp;nbsp; No Instapot yet, thinking about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fubonn is on 82nd, like the two Walmarts I saw (the one I went into is further south, in Clackamas, whereas the second came after the Entering Portland sign, me coming north).&amp;nbsp; I go there more often, as it&#39;s closer and Walmart - Amazon might be my online supplier of delivered goods, where I&#39;m not the one in the fossil fuel business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of which, I have a work sponsor ready to heat more of my building so we&#39;ve got a truck on the way on Monday.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not a new customer, having been at my current location since 1995 or thereabouts.&amp;nbsp; Newly married with child.&amp;nbsp; We used to call Montag but their customer list was acquired by another company.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The microwave just decided to blow one day, kinda like mom&#39;s knee (though the latter had more of an excuse). The Magic Chef gave up the magic, after over a decade of service I&#39;m reckoning.&amp;nbsp; My range is a Magic Chef too, avocado green like from the 1960s, came with the house.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The antique stove fits with my overall decor, which is likewise vintage, lots of vinyl paneling.&amp;nbsp; We had the wood paneling in the living room removed, along with the shag rug.&amp;nbsp; Pine floors.&amp;nbsp; Looks like a ski lodge where the wood takes some punishment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A skilled repair person could likely have identified a fried wire in the Costco-bought Magic Chef and made it good as new.&amp;nbsp; Our consumer culture encourages us to replace, not repair, these small appliances, though there&#39;s more of an aftermarket for the bigger ones, like washers and dryers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not the expert.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m the consumer, and some consuming I did.&amp;nbsp; Thanks to my knowing how to teach Python, I&#39;m able to afford a building with replaceable and irreplaceable gadgets and doodads.&amp;nbsp; Python and Martian Math as a combo.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s another popular dish.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re like a food cart, in a town of food pods (lots of competition).&lt;/div&gt;
