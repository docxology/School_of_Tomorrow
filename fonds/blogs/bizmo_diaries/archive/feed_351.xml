&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The indigenous Cascadian response to the need for new campus facilities (Global U / GST), including for asylum-seekers (e.g. homeless vets), is connected to the citizen diplomat pipeline, the arterial system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In another recent video I suggest the Madras, Oregon area as a place to test &quot;outdoor school&quot; equipment, which I&#39;m suggesting we may consider already furnished taking into account the shipping containers of Good Will type stuff.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;re able to get whole families outfitted with kitchen stuff without going begging to the &quot;everything brand new&quot; crowd for a slice of their shrink-wrapped just-off-the-shelf newer thing.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, the whole point is we&#39;re showcasing what a less wasteful lifestyle might mean.  We work, but not to endlessly duplicate the same stuff.  Our &quot;prop inventory&quot; lets us change costume, and yurt internals, without necessarily needing a monetary transaction.  
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A new aesthetic develops:  the nomadic monad.  You have everything you need on your person, and the luxury of not needing to own all these yurts you&#39;ll be visiting.  The campus has plenty of props in inventory, when you need those cups and saucers.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&#39;ve been yakking on social media about Hindu truckers in North America, and the variety this brings to truck stops sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
FB friend:&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #f2f3f5; color: #1c1e21; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;there was an article in the economist about the disproportionate number of Hindu truckers in North America.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Me:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #f2f3f5; color: #1c1e21; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s an editorial decision, to say &quot;disproportionate&quot; but they&#39;re Brits, disproportionately in North America from the beginning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
FB friend:&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #f2f3f5; color: #1c1e21; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #f2f3f5; color: #1c1e21; font-family: inherit; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;I think it&#39;s great to find Indian food at truck stops. Curry is better than burgers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Me:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #f2f3f5; color: #1c1e21; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;That&#39;s my vision of future truck stops: way more cosmopolitan in some hubs. They take over the malls, which are of dwindling interest to Amazon shoppers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The idea of a truck stop as more like a food court, with multi-ethnic cuisine, might be catching on in some areas where the shopping malls are feeling the pinch of Amazon.&amp;nbsp; The truck stop of tomorrow might be more a mall than a gas station.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Silicon Valley is all about making trucks driverless, whereas the startups I&#39;m looking at are taking up the real challenges that go with navigating the world&#39;s roads.&amp;nbsp; The driver exchange program I&#39;m writing about on &lt;i&gt;Medium&lt;/i&gt;, and elsewhere, gives a sense of the new possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #1c1e21; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;Just don&#39;t make truckers queue for hours or days, as if cargo inspection and substance control is your concern you can do that in other ways, away from any border, like the airlines do (screening is at port of call, final destination, say Cincinnati). You have plenty of tracking&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot; style=&quot;background-color: white; color: #1c1e21; display: inline; font-family: &amp;quot;helvetica neue&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;helvetica&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;arial&amp;quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;devices on your average rig, it&#39;s not going to just disappear on you (the owners are watching). Maybe the driver is with a global company and its citizenship may be indeterminate as companies are not responsible for authenticating citizenship documents. Open border states aren&#39;t surrendering the right to monitor carriers. Let governments play border games while transportation flows smoothly. That&#39;s probably more how it&#39;ll shape up in Asia. Lower48 has enjoyed open borders internally but doesn&#39;t play well with neighbors sometimes. The world is covered in sore spots, with or without open borders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AfrG_uY2XzY&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I get around to talking about the BDS campaign versus Iran, eventually.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not some official ambassador from Cascadia.  I&#39;m merely voicing my view that the population sample I&#39;m in touch with is not at all on board with any kind of war against Persia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the contrary, Portland and Shiraz have been looking at becoming sister cities.&amp;nbsp; That conversation continues, as far as I know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have some real history with Iran, in terms of personnel.  I&#39;m thinking of &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/02/report-from-afghanistan.html&quot;&gt;Peace House&lt;/a&gt; in particular.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Somehow the &quot;BDS&quot; meme got hijacked to where some people think it &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; to mean something &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/12/thinking-globally.html&quot;&gt;relating to Israel&lt;/a&gt;.  I don&#39;t deny that some activists, based on perceived success in South Africa, in moving us beyond Apartheid, tried a similar strategy with regard to some Israeli companies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although I worked for AFSC in &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/05/more-basement-archeology.html&quot;&gt;some chapters&lt;/a&gt;, I never stopped buying from Hewlett-Packard (big into biometrics used for border policing).  That&#39;s because I don&#39;t have time to do the research, and I&#39;m just the one guy.  No one cares what I do.  Even I don&#39;t that much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, the practice of BDS against Iran, Venezuela, Russia, is pretty virulent, and hypocritically sustained, even while Israel loudly proclaims it&#39;s somehow a primary victim.  That&#39;s not believable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sanctions against Iran, with the threat of pre-emptive attack based on some flimsy shim-sham reasoning (cite the attack on Iraq, or Gulf of Tonkin), vastly outstrip, in scale, the tiny boycotts here and there, of miscellaneous goods from the squatter settlements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My angle on Gaza is let&#39;s evacuate the place.&amp;nbsp; Rich people want the beach front property and don&#39;t care how many die to free up the real estate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.addictedtowar.com/docs/panama.htm&quot;&gt;Remember that ghetto&lt;/a&gt; in Panama the Apache helicopters went after?&amp;nbsp; I presume that was likewise all about land values, clearing out the slums in a demonstration of lethality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Humans are in the way. Nothing to do with nations or religions.&amp;nbsp; Everything to do with having fat bank accounts and a nice place in which to retire.&amp;nbsp; Caracas and Panama both look appealing, in addition to the Gaza strip.&amp;nbsp; More Miamis.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My test audience said things like &quot;vintage Kirby&quot; i.e. I make some broad points but then veer off into some world of my own, different planet maybe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did he just say &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;?  Why again?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, today was Gay Pride day (parade, waterfront festival) in Portland, a ritual and smoothly pulled off.  My mood took me into a rather alien mindset but not in such a way that I couldn&#39;t share a sense of celebration.  I wasn&#39;t being a party pooper.&amp;nbsp; I was adding to the diversity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks again to Patrick, Leela, Quinn (the dog) for their company today.  And of course Carol, who sat on the porch through a lot of today.&lt;br /&gt;

 see it as a choice between squandering resources murdering around the

reasonably certain a country as sick as America is wholly incapable of 
truly caring for those in need. If we don&#39;t cure the mental illness 
(leading to wars) we won&#39;t get anywhere with the basics of self 
preservation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[verbatim, posted as Public ]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My current position on political theater (a main gossip station):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I&#39;m OK agreeing that the RT America crowd, at least, was 
impressed with Hawaiian presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, as various
 stories alleged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&#39;s anti regime change wars, pro legalized 
weed (anti Prohibition), pro bitcoin, free Assange and Manning, twice 
deployed, still active duty with the Hawaiian national guard.  Serves in
 Congress.  All good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text_exposed_show&quot;&gt;
I agree with RT America:  there&#39;s no one better.  Ergo she has no chance 
in a &quot;mediocrecy&quot; (where media is mediocre).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the theory that RT America narratives stay consistent with those of 
the Kremlin for the most part, I&#39;ll speculate that Putin and his cronies
 likewise admire Tulsi for her principles, despite her relative youth 
and inexperience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I see nothing wrong with the Kremlin having 
and expressing a  preference through their state-sponsored media channel
 on Youtube.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty obvious that&#39;s what&#39;s happening, 
judging from what I&#39;ve seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With all eyes watching social
 media for cyber-manipulation, the best policy is just to state one&#39;s 
views plainly.  But then clearly Putin doesn&#39;t get to vote, the American
 people do, and Americans are the ones who are pushing Tulsi off stage 
at the moment, because she&#39;s a peacenik and for other reasons.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Americans are also the ones who elected Trump.  I don&#39;t buy for a minute
 that a few clever memes on FB or even Podesta emails on Wikileaks, 
could have countered the complacency of the &quot;she&#39;s a sure thing shoo-in&quot;
 crowd. I expect less complacency in 2020.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If we can agree the 
Russian government would prefer Tulsi, then we can immunize ourselves 
against the still virulent &quot;Russians prefer Trump&quot; meme, which is a kind
 of cop out surrender on the part of Lower48ers who watch too much 
fictional Netflix about the spy world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Trumps were bored at 
that meeting in Trump Tower, about the Magnitsky Act. The Russians 
wanted adult conversation, but the campaigners wanted gossip.  Most 
Americans know next to nothing about the Magnitsky Act.  That&#39;s one of 
those adults only topics, not a good fit for the current White House.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One of the core subcultures emerging in California was that of retired Theosophists and other fellow travelers.&amp;nbsp; Some of them gravitated to Ojai, to be closer to Krishnamurti.&amp;nbsp; Esalen was not directly connected, having strong ties to Stanford University, however there&#39;s no getting away from the many Aquarian conspiracies that riddle Cascadia more generally.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Physics World (the &quot;new physics&quot;), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hippiessavedphysics.com/&quot;&gt;saved by hippies&lt;/a&gt;, made a big influence in literature through science fiction at first, and then by providing more direct commentary on &quot;consciousness&quot;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/mathsummit.html&quot;&gt;Sir Roger Penrose&lt;/a&gt; was one of those leading the pack, in picturing the Mind as a quantum device, making use of the quantum effects of Universe to transcend more deterministic forms of logic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bucky Fuller, connecting to American Transcendentalism by virtue of his ancestral roots on Bear Island, in addition to his Aquarian credentials, preserved a Brain versus Mind distinction, in case we wished to differentiate on the basis of function, between a storage/retrieval reflex machine, and the Zeitgeist, a shared phenomenon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember that Spiritualism achieved a relative apex around the time of Thomas Edison, contemporaneous with the investigation and industrial exploitation of electricity.&amp;nbsp; That extrasensory abilities, strongly believed in by many Theosophists, might have a physical basis in energetic phenomena is what made &quot;ESP&quot; seem scientific, to the Esalen people as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of all the philosophers, Bucky Fuller probably did the most to restore &quot;metaphysical&quot; to our vocabulary as a synonym for &quot;intellectual property&quot; (so-called).&amp;nbsp; If we subtract the &quot;who owns it&quot; bit and focus on the commons, we see humanity gaining competence over physical phenomena as evidenced by a &quot;more bang for the buck&quot; over time.&amp;nbsp; The military was especially impressed by the &quot;bang&quot; it was getting, in the form of weapons of mass suicide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However &quot;metaphysical&quot; is more a literary term that goes with the territory in post-911 Cascadia.&amp;nbsp; We teach Bucky Fuller in the context of American literature, not as physics.&amp;nbsp; Both literature and physics have permission to discuss &quot;consciousness&quot; or the lack thereof.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re free to bridge to STEM, but we don&#39;t come from there, when adding Synergetics to the syllabus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mentioned Edison above: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
It was 1884, the year the people of France presented the United States 
with the Statue of Liberty. Tesla had with him twenty-five cents and a 
letter of recommendation addressed to the American inventor Thomas Alva 
Edison (1847−1931). When the inevitable rift occurred between these two 
Promethean inventors, Tesla began to frequent the fabulous Palm Room at 
the Waldorf. It was here he would mingle with the giants of American 
industry in hope of finding the venture capital he needed to launch an 
independent career. Eventually, he did.&amp;nbsp; As soon as his personal 
situation improved, he took up residence at the Waldorf. Of all the 
strange twists and turns and turns his long career took, Tesla admitted 
at the end of his life that there were only two things that gave him the
 hope he needed to fulfill his dreams, his American citizenship and the 
Waldorf Astoria Hotel. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
That&#39;s from &lt;a href=&quot;https://paullaffoley.net/writings-2/homage-to-gaudi/&quot;&gt;Paul Laffoley&#39;s website&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you know your &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/wmbs-satire.html&quot;&gt;Rudyard Kipling&lt;/a&gt;, you may be thinking X = White, but we&#39;re not so clear what that means anymore, ever since the Noah hypothesis was deprecated in favor of the dinosaur one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We may still imagine some sub-species of overlord, tasked with taking on the great burdens, but lets not pretend to go by melanin content in the epidermis.&amp;nbsp; Are they reptilian?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taking everything literally is the fastest way to close doors on most possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember hallway monitors?&amp;nbsp; If you went to a large school, you might have had experience with the role.&amp;nbsp; The hallways of academia, like many hallways, have their monitors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do they look for inappropriate cartoons posted on doorways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Professors often showcase humor at the entrances to their sanctums.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some people profess about philosophy, having &quot;doctor of philosophy&quot; degrees.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However the PhD degree has come to signify proficiency in high degree, minus any stipulation that philosophy is involved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One could say the PhD degree is fiat currency, in becoming divorced from the &quot;gold standard&quot; of what it originally stood for (proficiency in philosophy).&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s pure speculation on my part.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today was a religious holiday of sorts in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html&quot;&gt;pandas DataFrame&lt;/a&gt; of special datetimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/a&gt;&quot; is a type of Python object.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The religion in question:&amp;nbsp; Church of the Subgenius.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s the church of Bob Dobbs, who only appears to look normal (what with that pipe and all).&amp;nbsp; Is he really an X Man?&amp;nbsp; The church of slack is not about glorifying toil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does &quot;America&quot; want to finally become a country?&amp;nbsp; With the border situation that open, with Canada, chances are slim, according to some criteria.&amp;nbsp; But all talk of fences aside, doesn&#39;t becoming a first world nation imply some degree of caring for one&#39;s citizens?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html&quot;&gt;Cowardly Capitalist&lt;/a&gt; crowd is hoping to get Uncle Sam to protect them, both from competition abroad, and from citizens agitating for social services.&amp;nbsp; The burden the C3s imagine assuming, should they be required to demonstrate social responsibility, just seems too unAmerican to them. &lt;/div&gt;

I&#39;m filing this under Wanderers, however the weekly meeting at Linus Pauling House was short, as only three people showed, and quickly dispersed. I had intended to be on time, 7 PM sharp, but got caught up catching up on Brexit videos.&amp;nbsp; This Memorial Day weekend was simultaneously a big election time across Europe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I joined two of the remaining Wanderers at a different location, where I learned about alloy-making and lathes, especially when used to make screws, or, more accurately, threads.&amp;nbsp; Barry is an accomplished machinist and blisses out using tools every day.&amp;nbsp; I should visit his maker space again sometime.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve been taking in EU videos (a genre), thanks to Youtube.&amp;nbsp; Ted Turner&#39;s original vision for CNN included playing news shows from around the world.&amp;nbsp; In the era of broadcast and cable, you had expert editors connecting the dots for you.&amp;nbsp; What we have nowadays is video on demand, but it&#39;s not like we only get the raw intelligence.&amp;nbsp; Editors make Youtubes too, and help us weight whatever else we&#39;re watching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Presumably, if we&#39;re responsive to feedback, some sort of gradient descent will occur.&amp;nbsp; I just slipped into machine learning language, but lets remember those &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron&quot;&gt;perceptrons&lt;/a&gt;&quot; were designed to emulate us. Chelsea Manning would understand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In contrast to Barry, whose dad was also a machinist, my experience with large metal-working machines is mostly janitorial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One summer, I did cleanup around the various gigantic tools used to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokamak&quot;&gt;Tokamak&lt;/a&gt; fusion reactor prototype.&amp;nbsp; This was at &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Plasma_Physics_Laboratory&quot;&gt;the James Forrestal Campus&lt;/a&gt; off Route 1, near Princeton, where I lived at the time.&amp;nbsp; I mostly used compressed air, to blast metalic residue from hard-to-sweep places, and a squeeze bottle of soap and paper towels, to make the machines shiny.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What I notice from the EU videos is how so-called supranationals show up in debates as virtual nations. They may not have contiguous land masses, but they do have private control of many buildings and campuses, warehouses, docks, ships.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The psycho-sovereignties in question (mental complexes, outwardly expressed) feel they&#39;re getting locked into a larger military-industrial system. Locals feel they&#39;re either helpless victims (of more global forces) or are at least fighting, by organizing, to regain some control over the local situation.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I started my day doing a longer version of the above, but then realized I&#39;d referred to the Peters Projection as a Phillips Projection throughout.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&#39;t feel like patching it and started over, after doing my afternoon stint as a middle school teacher.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The content covered in that stint is what most of this video is about.

&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8CBUb3PTtaZ3AZtqvtirYd1aVdHhsufiEHGY1SLSkQ9Bk9k5efOha-RZyMEdAkFMwilSFBz6-IudNbIkpWeBRYor-D32XlIyOZFbTcIkpV87GdT89rd5VS5HAF9rEenwFAY0I/s1600/2987034913_4728c1e8f8_o.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;1200&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1600&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg8CBUb3PTtaZ3AZtqvtirYd1aVdHhsufiEHGY1SLSkQ9Bk9k5efOha-RZyMEdAkFMwilSFBz6-IudNbIkpWeBRYor-D32XlIyOZFbTcIkpV87GdT89rd5VS5HAF9rEenwFAY0I/s400/2987034913_4728c1e8f8_o.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By &quot;Peace Program&quot; I&#39;m not referring to AFSC&#39;s, which closed shop in Portland awhile ago.&amp;nbsp; That particular 501(c)(3) has had to morph over the years.&amp;nbsp; I used to serve as one of those flown to Philadelphia every year, for the annual meeting.&amp;nbsp; In my case, the Yearly Meeting footed the bill, but in other cases, the Quaker delegates get reimbursed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m referring, informally, to the Linus Pauling Center for Science, Peace and Health, on Hawthorne Boulevard, and the talks that it sometimes hosts.&amp;nbsp; Yes, ISEPP is another 501(c)(3) I&#39;ve served with, my wife the bookkeeper before that.&amp;nbsp; A well-known and much beloved lecture series, organized and staged by Terry Bristol, funded by generous donors, kept Portlanders way more in the loop than one might presume, for an &quot;out west&quot; town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Peter Bechtold is outside both those circuits (Quakers and ISEPP) yet he appears at the Linus Pauling House rather regularly to update us on what&#39;s going on in the world.&amp;nbsp; Oregon / Cascadia, in joining the Union, surrendered its foreign relations (one might call them) to those writing the official narrative of the country in the District of Columbia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Peter knows officialdom quite well and is highly traveled.&amp;nbsp; He was showing a map of Libya when I walked in, then Sudan, then Iran.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s been studying these places for decades, has briefed diplomats and two star generals.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s been a fixture around the State Department, and later Portland State.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My closest connection to Portland State was through Dr. Charles Bolton, still active duty when I moved back to Portland in the 1980s, and lived in his basement.&amp;nbsp; He later became an emeritus and loved to overlook the Columbia Gorge from his two story &quot;cabin&quot; (small house), across from Hood River.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was one of the best view properties to which I&#39;ve ever had frequent access.&amp;nbsp; The deck of Don Wardwell&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Meliptus&lt;/i&gt; scores highly as well, at the other extreme (right on the Columbia, versus high above looking down).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To summarize, Bechtold is frustrated by how our Lower48ers just don&#39;t have much sense of history, or geography (they go together) and that leaves them naively vulnerable to others&#39; agendas.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d agree, but also point out that Lower48ers have abdicated responsibility (one could put it that way) by giving moneyed interests a simple API (as we geeks say) in the form of the USG control panel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you know how to pay to play, you&#39;ll get the USG to do some awesome things on your behalf.&amp;nbsp; Most Lower48ers wouldn&#39;t know where to begin in that regard.&amp;nbsp; It&#39;s not their game.&amp;nbsp; They get to watch on TV as spectators.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Case in point:&amp;nbsp; some &quot;bitch boats&quot; (paraphrasing candidate Gabbard), pimped out by the prez, are currently heading towards Persia for the express purpose of stirring up trouble.&amp;nbsp; The civilian bozos have war on their minds and hope to pin the Pentagon in some wrestling position, where lighting a fuse is the only way to save face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Public opinion has to be properly prepped first.&amp;nbsp; Which takes us back to Dr. Bechtold&#39;s thesis:&amp;nbsp; that we&#39;re a nation ever willing to be hoodwinked.&amp;nbsp; Been then, we&#39;re completely out of the loop anyway.&amp;nbsp; Portlanders haven&#39;t favored any of the District&#39;s great adventures since and including the Vietnam experience.&amp;nbsp; This wasn&#39;t Nixon country.&amp;nbsp; We boasted moderate Republicans, perhaps a vanished species I don&#39;t know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course I&#39;m oversimplifying.&amp;nbsp; Oregon&#39;s rural areas have a different take on world affairs.&amp;nbsp; They don&#39;t get to go to ISEPP lectures, or talks like the one tonight, which is too bad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We always thought radio and television would do a better job of turning the airwaves into more of a public university, but the licenses mostly went elsewhere.&amp;nbsp; Universities got a few low powered stations is all.&amp;nbsp; But of course now we have the internet, and new forms of curriculum sharing.&lt;/div&gt;

Leela is crashed on the couch, napping, here on a visit.&amp;nbsp; She used to live here, with a different name.&amp;nbsp; The new name is part of her business persona, as a kind of yoga teacher.&amp;nbsp; I refer to as a religious studies major, which she is, in this recent story on&lt;i&gt; Medium&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m hitting the limits of an older version of OS X, wondering if I really need the latest Homebrew in order to get the latest MySQL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What will the newer version do that I need?&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m just a code school type teacher these days.&amp;nbsp; For the kind of stuff I&#39;m doing, the older version should be sufficient, if I need it at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Seeking relief from my upgrade woes, I went back into perusing Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve got a Jerry Kroth video playing in the background, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/CGO5aNx2hos&quot;&gt;introducing his new book&lt;/a&gt;, about crop circles.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.collectivepsych.com/&quot;&gt;Dr. Kroth&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp; Associate Professor Emeritus (UCSC) is not afraid to venture beyond the fringes of accepted and/or settled science.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&#39;s into spinning some theories, asserting some of these patterns need to be decoded, as they allude the specialized science.&amp;nbsp; One of these patterns, he claims, is a diagram of Vitamin A.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are the aliens trying to be helpful, drawing attention to Vitamin A deficiency around the world?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He just put the new Youtube up today, and the Youtube recommender flagged it, given I&#39;ve watched his stuff before.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This morning, as I fixed breakfast for Carol (recently turned 90), I took in &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/RVKIAUPImJg&quot;&gt;a PBS documentary on Andrew Carnegie&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; The movie explores his relationship with labor unions and workers more generally.&amp;nbsp; Lots of details, talking heads.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Connecting these dots a little more, Kroth is one of those in academia who looks into UFOs as well. He goes in the same Venn Diagram circle as Daniel Sheehan in that sense.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Sheehan has his &quot;octave of world views&quot; wherein we progress to encounters with alien intelligence.&lt;br /&gt;

We respect &quot;jobs&quot; and &quot;work&quot; enough to pay people to do them, but think 
&quot;study&quot; -- as in &quot;work-study&quot; -- is not work and therefore it&#39;s no one&#39;s
 job to get educated. Make studying paid work, and you&#39;ve solved a lot 
of problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From current studies:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;My small campus tests should 
teach us a lot.  We could have a cash-like crypto &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; credits in the 
more academic sense, which nevertheless have currency-like attributes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Could be that when you join the camp (which is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a prison camp) you 
put your usual wallet (with any outside currency), charge cards and 
phone in a secure locker.  The camp cellphone will come pre-equipped 
with your wallet and apps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;When you leave the camp in about three weeks
 (average stay for this facility) you&#39;ll get your stuff back while 
returning the camp gear (you probably get to keep some samples though 
i.e. a &quot;swag bag&quot; -- product placement is part of the business model).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Magnitsky died in a
 Russian prison being held on charges relating to working for this UK 
oligarch who was originally Putin&#39;s fan but later claims to be his 
greatest enemy. We all heard a lot about Magnitsky when that famous 
Trump Tower meeting with the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Russian 
lobbyist occurred. She was not there to talk dirt on Hillary and 
everyone got super bored, as oligarch squabbles over big money and 
reputation backstabbing are too ordinary in those circles, where 
syndicates demonize one another incessantly (Hollywood is more friendly?
  Maybe all that Scientology is working for some?).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Browder
 says his lawyer was clubbed to death while chained to his death bed in 
prison, by the very people Magnitsky was accusing of financial fraud, as
 Browder&#39;s legal representative, or lawyer.  But then there&#39;s a 
counter-narrative which is what makes this a rabbit hole, somewhat by 
definition (a vortex of contesting stories converging towards the same 
truths).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;We heard about Browder again when Putin and
 Trump met in privacy in Helsinki and Putin offered to help out with the
 Mueller indictment of the GRU guys, in exchange for some interviews 
with Browder.  No one would be in custody or under immediate threat of 
extradition.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong about the details of Putin&#39;s 
statesman-like offer (there&#39;s a treaty about nations giving each other 
mutual support in criminal investigations), as I was not privy to the 
meeting and back then had not yet connected the dots between Browder and
 Magnitsky.  Trump comes out of the meeting saying this could work, 
probably knowing less about Browder (or Magnitsky) than I do at this 
point.  Too boring.  But he&#39;s soon told that Browder is Putin&#39;s number 
one foe and it all clicks into place.  Who knows.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyway,
 fascinating stuff.  The Magnitsky Act sails through Congress on the 
basis of this compelling testimony from Browder, and becomes the 
convenient hammer, the justification needed, to turn the screws 
everywhere on the Axis of Evil, always shifting (remember BRIC?), based 
on whatever the public will believe. The public is infinitely gullible 
and has rarely applied the brakes.  Now that more of the public is being
 coerced into homelessness and unforgiving debt, the political model is 
to drop them from the unemployment roles and make counting their votes 
harder, as your tent on the sidewalk is not a registered voter address, 
by definition.  Problem solved re that democracy business, a pipe dream.
  Back to the oligarch infighting channel, the one we most love to 
sponsor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;When a Medal of Freedom winner
 publishes a book saying &quot;the USA we have known is now bankrupt and 
extinct&quot; and that doesn&#39;t make headlines, we know right away that 
journalism lacks integrity. Walter Kaufmann (Princeton University)
 warned us about journalism. I sent &quot;headlines we&#39;d like to see&quot; to WaPo
 at the time. &quot;Medal of Freedom Winner Declares USA Bankrupt!&quot;  I was 
living in DC back then, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/making-waves-in-dc.html&quot;&gt;making trouble with my typewriter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WIRED
 and such have little choice but to fall into the trap of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/2016/03/buckminster-fuller-brilliant-crank-lot-teach-silicon-valley/&quot;&gt;calling him a crackpot&lt;/a&gt; (as he hoped they would, Brer Rabbit style (&quot;please don&#39;t throw
 me into the briar patch&quot;)).  When you call someone with that many 
patents, awards, degrees, published works a &quot;crackpot&quot; you pay a price, 
as what does that make the rest of us by comparison?  Setting the bar a 
little high are we?  Idiocracy ensues, with WIRED paving the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So
 now we&#39;re in the situation where a thinker advertised to the world for 
his positive futurism (officially) is not read in schools because too 
much of a threat for speaking truth to power. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like 
how could one possibly claim to know or teach American History and/or 
Literature and not include that bit about a top celebrity turning a top 
subversive?  How can we claim to have any &quot;public schools&quot; whatsoever 
when the geometry for which Bucky was explicitly given an award is not 
shared?  If you don&#39;t read &lt;i&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/i&gt; in high school, let alone 
college, you must not have had real teachers.  Phony baloney is what you
 got.  Oh, and now they want you to pay back those loans?  For what 
again?  For the heritage you never got?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of 
indulging in outrage, I can just sit back and laugh, knowing 
privatization is complete, the public schools are all dead, and Bucky 
was entirely correct in his prophesy and proclamation (as close to a 
declaration as we&#39;ll ever need).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The corporate 
media need very much to prop up their tawdry version of Uncle Sam (an 
imperialist psychopath), lest we see through it all and make Exxon pay 
for its own team of goons, rather than tapping into a privatized 
mercenary force funded by unrepresented Americans who&#39;s heritage was 
denied them in their schooling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;They don&#39;t even share Bucky with the 
military do they?  &lt;i&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/i&gt; at West Point?  Probably only the 
CIA reads it (required) as it&#39;s mentioned so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After
 two generations of not teaching easy simple streamlining tetravolume 
stuff to 4th or 8th&amp;nbsp; or 12th graders (already certified useful by highest authorities), I
 think it&#39;s more than obvious we don&#39;t have a free press or a real 
public education system.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel free to endlessly mock the true believers and their pathetic substitute for real learning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;*&amp;nbsp; *&amp;nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m saying that 
just because MF winner publishes yadda yadda, that we must all 
agree it&#39;s true, i.e. &quot;yes of course the US is bankrupt and extinct, the
 great Bucky hath spoken.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Not at all.  No one has that kind of power. 
 The book jacket calls it satire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s just a once-adulated, much-awarded, icon of positive futurism, did in fact write 
that, and gave his reasoning and context, and then was awarded the MF 
(not tossed in jail).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;It&#39;s the historical facts of the matter I&#39;m 
underlining, not that we have to treat Fuller&#39;s writing as edicts.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These
 facts are what&#39;re so amazing and crazy-interesting, especially when you factor 
in there&#39;s a newfangled kind of geometry, and geodesic domes and... wow.  Why not
 in schools?&amp;nbsp; Are we really that afraid of our own past?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets just share the facts.  Then be skeptical and critical, say why he&#39;s wrong and so on. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But
 to just claim he&#39;s a crackpot, so we&#39;re justified in our silence, no that
 doesn&#39;t fly it all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Too double standard.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;If Bucky&#39;s a crackpot, after 
so many faculty positions, awards, patents, inventions, then what are 
we, who think that way about him?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I keep going back to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apnews.com/3187ffc2e9d641f19d61e685f3da9dc2&quot;&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;.  Why not pursue?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;It&#39;d be like that 
Skripal case, where the accused GRU agents, posing as tourists to 
Salisbury (as if there were anything there) smuggled nerve agent in a 
sealed perfume bottle, latter discovered by hapless dumpster divers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;Brits saw through their cover story 
immediately, having grown up on John le Carré spy novels and knowing a 
&quot;likely story&quot; when they see one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;Put all these GRU guys, who supposedly 
jumped to their feet when Trump said &quot;get those emails&quot; (Hillary&#39;s missing), on CNN (like 
they did for Osama).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;They&#39;d have to send a team to Russia and true, you&#39;re
 not in jail in America where the cowards threaten you even before 
trial.  I don&#39;t want sleaze balls getting involved.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;The reaction when Putin made 
this offer was &quot;no fair, the president trusts Putin more than us&quot;. In 
light of what the president considered a &quot;witch hunt&quot; this was in no way
 surprising. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it seems the Mueller 
investigation had nothing to lose by at least gathering more evidence. 
The GRU guys would be confronted with the same forensic evidence that 
convinced the grand jury.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;We could all learn a ton about the technology
 used to leave or remove fingerprints, as when trying to conceal one&#39;s 
own moves and/or frame others.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The public has 
proved that it has an appetite for this kind of stuff.  Trump saw a way 
forward with potentially high TV ratings.  Is it really too late?  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I
 guess the FBI (special prosecutor) closed the investigation without 
ever caring to actually interview the indicted foreign nationals.  They 
wanted to extradite first, get the alleged criminals into custody, where
 they could be put in solitary and otherwise mistreated (ala Chelsea 
Manning).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously the Russians were not about to 
turn over their own military officers to a foreign power on flimsy 
charges, before ever seeing a shred of forensic evidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x _1n4g&quot;&gt;&lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;_3l3x&quot;&gt;Dismissing 
Putin&#39;s offer out of hand, after the US president said he thought it 
worth pursuing, proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the president has 
very limited power.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The internet is abuzz with rumors, that Yang Gang is hoping to &quot;steal&quot; the mascot of the Trumpians, Pepe the Frog. The rumor is sketchy for a host of reasons, starting with Gamers who&#39;ve adopted Pepe were not, to a player, loyal to that one camp to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pepe grew up alongside Annoying Orange, after Evil Bert got too scary (mixed up with Al Qaeda, another story).&amp;nbsp; He needs to live on beyond the Trump Era, and so if he takes on some Yang vibe, is that really a radical transectomy, or more a re-shade and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gDUeYLuITM&quot;&gt;new slant&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A typical scenario for a Gamer is I&#39;m doing well in a cool basement, holding down some part time work, underemployed but addicted to gaming anyway, and that&#39;s a lot of work in itself.&amp;nbsp; Youtubes show what a lot of work it is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then some foreign policy wonks from Groupthink Inc. come along, and whisper in the ear of some all-gullible Columbia (the name of a District, and a mythical figure), that she needs to yank our boys away from their computer games and deploy them in Middle Eastern deserts, to right some wrong that&#39;s being done. &quot;Go shock and awe someone son&quot; says the latest &quot;brought to you by...&quot; Uncle Sam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many troops witnessed first hand that &quot;doing good&quot; and &quot;spreading democracy&quot; had a lot more to do with spreading terror, and that families back home were paying the price.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Tulsi Gabbard followers include an overlapping constituency, many stuck overseas to this day, and deprived of much representation.&amp;nbsp; No wonder there&#39;s a Yang-Tulsi meme going.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having siblings overseas in harm&#39;s way is no way to encourage concentration in school.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These wars needed to have been necessary, in retrospect, to justify the continued allegiance of the eligible classes of male and now also female resident, whether citizens or in line for said status.&amp;nbsp; Keeping that narrative intact has proved difficult among the English speakers (the UK has gone through some similar soul searching).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Yang Gang comes along with new Silicon Valley think, and a kind of economics relating more to the thermodynamics of Planet Earth than we&#39;re used to, and fully conversant with automation, then Wall Street gets nervous.&amp;nbsp; The financial capitals have their own economics which they understand, and which is less like &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2019/03/csn-explained.html&quot;&gt;electrical engineering&lt;/a&gt; (with a solar power socket).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pepe might be safely symbolic in the traditional financial sector, which has gained control of governments on many levels, but Silicon Valley has its own metaphysics, inheriting as much from Asia as the European families.&amp;nbsp; The Empire State is more comfortable with a mindset it well understands, even if it poses as despising same.&amp;nbsp; At least Trump&#39;s main focus is the Middle East.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yang is happy to discuss his race, and what it&#39;s like to be bullied, but how that gives him no right to say he knows what it&#39;s like to be black, and stigmatized for it.&amp;nbsp; That part of his banter is nicely worked out, and then race becomes more of a non-issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sure we&#39;re allowed to notice people&#39;s &quot;race&quot; (whatever that means to us), and talk about it (somewhat differently).&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s not at war with the many vernaculars.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s comfortable with colloquialisms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In that regard, Yang is media-fluent in a way Trump surprisingly is as well (for someone that old -- but groomed by TV to be ratings-worthy).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I don&#39;t see myself as the answer man, when it comes to how Pepe will tip.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m purposely not reading a lot of opinions on this topic, as I&#39;d prefer to think it through independently.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;ll be watching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do know that a lot of draft age youths would prefer $1000 a month to play computer games, some of which could be educational &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/09/benefactor-new-board-game.html&quot;&gt;and rewarding&lt;/a&gt; in other ways.&amp;nbsp; Ditto their parents and siblings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a Coffee Shops Network avatar, with gaming for charity blueprints, I&#39;m obviously not trying to fight the Gamer community.&amp;nbsp; Quakers Play Quake is one of my imaginary bumper stickers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yang and I share an appreciation for truckers and trucking (the industry).&amp;nbsp; He doesn&#39;t know about &lt;i&gt;Truckers for Peace&lt;/i&gt; (citizen diplomats, getting academic credit, with truck stops the new embassies in some ways -- including for the so-called &quot;virtual&quot; or &quot;diaspora&quot; nations).

The downstairs office doubles as a guest room for Carol, who is more than a guest (she&#39;s my mom), whereas the back room with all the telecommunications doubles as a guest room.&amp;nbsp; That leave&#39;s the daughters&#39; bedroom upstairs, vacated by both, to serve as a full time office (there&#39;s no bed).&amp;nbsp; I feature it in my taxes, if that still matters.&amp;nbsp; It used to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Said Carol wants to meet and greet an old friend moving to Portland, however her sleep schedule is such that making it to Multnomah Friends is far from easy.&amp;nbsp; At the moment, the jury is still out.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve missed the main worship, which starts in four minutes, but then there&#39;s still social hour.&amp;nbsp; This is Meeting for Business day, meaning they&#39;ll be having a potluck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My long term guest Lindsey, since departed and part time in Nepal, pioneered using the half finished basement as digs.&amp;nbsp; The telecomm office was leaking back then (literally), as you&#39;ll find out if you explore my Flickr album.&amp;nbsp; We both had our relationships with other people.&amp;nbsp; Having a floor between us worked well.&amp;nbsp; Later Jen moved into Carol&#39;s office.&amp;nbsp; She lives in LA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both Jen and Lindsey, and later Melody, were my housemates when Occupy rolled around.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d lived with several housemates in college, and afterwards. That Harrison Street resembled my previous lifestyle (e.g. 2 Dickinson Street, Princeton University) is perhaps not all that surprising.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our kitchen had long been a hub for &lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt;, more for auxiliary storage than front lines prep (church kitchens are much bigger).&amp;nbsp; During Occupy, Melody and Lindsey help FNB establish a serving site, which later moved when all those paper plate and disposable utensil people showed up.&amp;nbsp; I never moved to a tent, and instead maintained my logistical role as a food deliverer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&#39;ve curious about the Occupy chapter, it&#39;s documented in detail from my unique perspective in these blogs.&amp;nbsp; As for the global phenomenon, I don&#39;t know that there was one.&amp;nbsp; Attempts to connect Arab Spring to what was happening on Wall Street, in Portland, in Syria... I wasn&#39;t one to see those as tightly connected.&amp;nbsp; I had my OPDX point of view.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0Czejdxry0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m thinking &quot;art school&quot; in the sense that we&#39;re seeking generic fluency with shapes in space.  Just polyhedrons is more Platonic than time/size nudes, but only by a tad, as they need to be rendered in time and space, or imagined.  A use of &quot;porn&quot; in common circulation is &quot;any core theme of some pictures&quot; so like a collection of pictures about trains is thereby &quot;train porn&quot; and so on.  We&#39;ve seen this use among geeks &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/01/i-robot.html&quot;&gt;since BarCamp at least&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So &quot;polyhedron porn&quot; is a lot of what Art School is about, in terms of exercising those CAD muscles you&#39;ll need, for 3D printing, perhaps for sports (downhill skiing requires good spatial sense).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The content I pick up on is &quot;level playing field&quot; for the most part in that just about any audience is equally unfamiliar, unless part of some literati digerati that&#39;s been silently following along.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ve known about the Jitterbug for decades perhaps.&amp;nbsp; In that case, a lot of this content is recognized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What might be less recognizable is the &quot;S factor&quot; banter I&#39;ve bolted on in part two, as this jargon arises from telecommunications among Synergetics Explorer Award winners, little known among artists either, although I claim a few big names in my circle.&amp;nbsp; David organized the trip to see Magnus Wenninger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &quot;S factor&quot; is just a decimal number, or use any base, a quantity, and ratio between two volumes, one named &quot;S module&quot; the other named &quot;E module&quot;.&amp;nbsp; These, in turn, come from a small vocabulary of modules evolved in a prose work in philosophy, on the shelves since the 1970s.&amp;nbsp; Some of us were already involved in similar explorations but found common ground in Fuller&#39;s vocabulary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a long time, David translated his findings into writings about the T module in Synergetics, which is shape-wise identical to the E, but has a different surface:volume ratio.&amp;nbsp; Some decades back, he gear shifted as he came to see he&#39;d been studying the E, less so the T.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We did have a breakthrough on the T however, which is bumping up the T module RT&#39;s volume by 3/2, from 5 to 7.5, brings its vertexes into congruence with those of the volume 6 RD.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
However, these two videos don&#39;t mention the RD or RT much at all.&amp;nbsp; The RD goes by in a flash, whereas I mine the RT just to get the E.&amp;nbsp; I need to derive S/E (the so-called &quot;S factor&quot;) in order to get my Python generator (named &quot;Jitterbug&quot;) to spit back next values (a sequence of volumes, as you&#39;re welcome to discover).&lt;br /&gt;

I understand how casinos themselves might like to have some control over the machines I&#39;ve been talking about.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2019/03/csn-explained.html&quot;&gt;Over on CSN&lt;/a&gt;, the discussion has turned more to hardware, the actual arcade or casino style gambling machine, modified to pump crypto to charities.&amp;nbsp; Church bingo.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Retrofitting an old arcade game with the necessary internals is easier than getting a casino classic, most likely, though ironically.&amp;nbsp; The machinery of payout has been simplified, even in the classic setting.&amp;nbsp; Here, payout is to those fintech thermometers, or to this or that QR code.&amp;nbsp; You may actually &quot;shoot money&quot; out of a gun in some games, giving health and happiness to your cute and cuddly targets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, I&#39;m talking about old junk and garage based experiments in some cases.&amp;nbsp; You need your own internal crypto to play with, the money of the house, the currency by which parents pay their kids sometimes, redeemable through the parental bank and/or catalog.&amp;nbsp; Do the dishes and you&#39;re credited with this or that cartoon.&amp;nbsp; Smart houses already include these, don&#39;t they?&amp;nbsp; Hey, Alexa!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Play pinball, get to a level, and your winnings start meaning real money from the coffers of Big Company, with its Good Will line item.&amp;nbsp; The circuit diagrams make sense to electronics engineers, who understand about amplification already.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you&#39;ve designed the games to be fine tunable, then you&#39;ll be able to excite performance as a way of valving &quot;ions&quot; (charged particles) to charity, leading to repeat business and reputation building.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think of a cryptocurrency as &quot;ions&quot; (includes &quot;anions&quot;) meaning particles with the ability to do work.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s just a shorthand for &quot;battery&quot; i.e. a source of power or revenue on the chip.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want your CPU to do its teraflops, you need to feed it, power the motherboard.&amp;nbsp; We seem a lot&amp;nbsp; less clear about people, whether to power them, despite their evident godliness (NIH -- not invented here).&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re suspicious.&amp;nbsp; Indeed, a lot of companies sell the implements of people slaughter (like Home Depot but focused on mayhem and demolition).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The CSN nodes are not about recruiting vast numbers into the people slaughter business, lucrative though that may be.&amp;nbsp; We have our standards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, causes you&#39;d willingly fund may also be causes you&#39;d support by other means as well, such as by traveling to a work/study site.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously the authorities don&#39;t want crypto to fund armed and dangerous organizations, which is why I&#39;m leveraging my Quaker background to get out ahead with a brand that&#39;s clearly not about weapons trafficking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not advertising a lot of other prohibitions though.&amp;nbsp; There&#39;s no ban in principle on serving boozes, such as rums.&amp;nbsp; Whiskeys.&amp;nbsp; In some regions, I understand local laws prevent such sales, however I&#39;m just making it clear where the restrictions are coming from (i.e. not me).&amp;nbsp; The Nodes (&quot;shops&quot; in shoptalk) need morphological capabilities, and biodiversity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of guns (implicitly -- we were talking about weapons), the North Americans treasure their privacy and private property rights as much as their right to bear arms in public places.&amp;nbsp; But what about on private property, if the owner has rights?&amp;nbsp; Can&#39;t Farmer Jones, a Quaker, keep all guns off his property?&amp;nbsp; The litigation piles up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The etiquette of the West was to respect the wishes of a church, such that gun nuts would leave their pieces in the carriage, with the driver.&amp;nbsp; Naturally that&#39;s an invitation to cowards in search of unarmed victims, and some churches might post armed sentries at the door, assuming local police respect the practice.&amp;nbsp; Hotels.&amp;nbsp; Theaters.&amp;nbsp; Zoos.&amp;nbsp; Theme parks.&amp;nbsp; Not all of these belong to the government.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Am I saying Nodes will be &quot;invitation only&quot; and more like speakeasies?&amp;nbsp; Am I suggesting airport style screenings to get in?&amp;nbsp; No, not in general.&amp;nbsp; Those would be special case.&amp;nbsp; Think of night clubs you already know.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not reinventing every wheel here.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember the prototyping chapter.&amp;nbsp; You don&#39;t want the general public working your machines until you&#39;ve had a chance to work out the kinks.&amp;nbsp; Every industry has its skunk works, its test pilots.&lt;/div&gt;
