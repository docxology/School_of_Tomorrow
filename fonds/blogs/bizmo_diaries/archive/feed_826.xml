&lt;br /&gt;
He haunts the Good Will sometimes, knowing it&#39;s a place to score finds and today found a really great condition copy of a classic by Linus Pauling and E. Bright Wilson, which one is welcome to &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/details/introductiontoqu031712mbp&quot;&gt;read for free&lt;/a&gt; on the Web:&lt;br /&gt;

Not that this book is light reading by any means.  Pauling was a good clear writer in general though, Glenn points out, and I assume Wilson was too.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066993/&quot;&gt;The Devils&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;is a reenactment of an historical period when France was undergoing incipient nationalism (this was long before Napoleon). &amp;nbsp;The so-called King of France (a royal) is kept feeling insecure by the &quot;threat&quot; of any city within its &quot;borders&quot; with walls. &amp;nbsp;Yet with a rampant plague going around, having a wall is actually good sanitation and the local strongman knows it. So the strongman must be framed and then murdered for his &quot;crimes&quot;, which provides the plot for the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That the strongman happens to be a priest is very convenient for the framers, as he&#39;s something of a rock star with the nuns. &amp;nbsp;Absent family planning or competent medical services, when he gets a nun pregnant, she has no social security and freaks out, leading to momentum for a backlash against his studly ways. &amp;nbsp;The head of the nunnery doesn&#39;t quite have her head screwed on straight and she becomes the primary vector for vengeance, and ultimately furthers the king&#39;s minders&#39; plot to fell the walls of the town.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The priest reminded me of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/12/starry-night.html&quot;&gt;Copernicus&lt;/a&gt;, also hounded by fellow Catholics for having a live-in partner whom he listed as a servant in official papers. &amp;nbsp;Lots of priests had women friends, which Protestants used against them, leveraging the hypocrisy charge, although this particular priest had done his homework and found nothing Biblical to support celibacy in the first place. &amp;nbsp;Or rather, the Bible tends to self cancel on many issues, with voices taking all kinds of positions. &amp;nbsp;The Quran is the same way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Copernicus, Mercator, Descartes... all these good souls lived in terror of the Inquisition, and always for the same reason: &amp;nbsp;their intelligence was superior to the Pope&#39;s. &amp;nbsp;Any titular Pope or King is prone to throwing a hissy fit when some mirror mirror on the wall says someone else is the Snow White du jour. &amp;nbsp;The resulting rage feeds a desire for vengeance. &amp;nbsp;In the case of Mercator, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/02/control-room-collection.html&quot;&gt;better maps&lt;/a&gt; than the Vatican&#39;s, that meant jail time. &amp;nbsp;For &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/08/of-quaker-schools-and-descartes.html&quot;&gt;Descartes&lt;/a&gt;, also caught in the middle of religious wars, it meant encrypting some of his best secrets in time capsules not decoded until the 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The nuns do not have the benefit of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/red-book-not-maos.html&quot;&gt;depth psychology&lt;/a&gt; in the 1600s and have no way to deal with the unconscious other than buying into the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/another-wittgenstein-essay.html&quot;&gt;namespace&lt;/a&gt; of demons and devils, the occasional angel. &amp;nbsp;Instead of psychoanalysts, you had exorcists and the Inquisition fielded these psychopaths by the gross. &amp;nbsp;Not surprisingly, the minders wanting to capitalize on France as a nation are hell bent on using the Inquisition as their tool, to bring down the strongman and the walls protecting his people from the plague. &amp;nbsp;They are successful in their plot and France goes on to terrorize the world as one more nation-state monster with corporate personhood (or &quot;sovereignty&quot;).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113393199563990769'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/113393199563990769'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-devils-movie-review.html' title='The Devils (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7851524978954484036</id><published>2014-10-25T17:30:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2014-12-08T16:03:02.407-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Blustery Day</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
High winds today, trees bending, quite stormy but without the driving rain.&amp;nbsp; I was walking in it no problem, descending Mt. Tabor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was mini boom town in Stump Town in those years, with many a new palace, new bridge (making a dozen total).&amp;nbsp; A proud city approximately at the end of both &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Trail&quot;&gt;the Oregon Trail&lt;/a&gt; (pioneered by Lewis &amp;amp; Clark) and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula_Floods&quot;&gt;Missoula Floods&lt;/a&gt; (in different chapters obviously).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last Dick Pugh talk I missed wasn&#39;t &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/02/cosmic-consciousness.html&quot;&gt;content I&#39;d heard&lt;/a&gt; i.e. I missed out on quite a good talk by all accounts.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d been &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/10/failings.html&quot;&gt;moping in my beer&lt;/a&gt; contemplating a different fashion line up now that ol&#39; Stetson Gun Club was gone for good.&amp;nbsp; Longmire without a hat?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Punch &amp;amp; Judy Show at Math Forum has been productive for me at least in that I got in touch with a GST buddy in India, a pen pal if you will, who knows more about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9628831&quot;&gt;Warfield and Pearce&lt;/a&gt; than I do.&amp;nbsp; We&#39;ve had our differences, which I&#39;ve &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/09/ppug-2014924-ongoing-threads.html&quot;&gt;even blogged about&lt;/a&gt;, but that only shows how much we care.&amp;nbsp; Awww...&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;281&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/xeXjCSzuXEs?rel=0&quot; width=&quot;500&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have reason to use this clip in a somewhat academic context, in a footnote to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/timeit.html&quot;&gt;some timeit() project &lt;/a&gt;where different versions have to race.  The student is asked to cut a function&#39;s time by almost two thirds or more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than destroy the slower function, the two versions are raced, or maybe more than two.  In my thinking, this image of a &quot;snail race&quot; occurs, and this movie clip, which makes it all come alive in CG.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also appreciate this clip because of its resonance with real life situations of course.  The film was obviously made with children in mind, and they know getting teased and/or teasing at recess.&amp;nbsp; They got teased for being &quot;a crier&quot; perhaps; and sure enough, one of the snails is immediately picked on by a bully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s no time to waste developing personalities however.  The film itself does that at leisure, but our clip merely takes us to the races.&amp;nbsp; Barely more than a minute.&amp;nbsp; Yet a winner is found.&amp;nbsp; Given this is a cartoon, the laws of physics need not apply.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The premise of this movie his hilarious:  a snail with aspirations to become a speed demon.  The sheer idiocy of the premise, combined with expert follow-through, makes this a favorite of mine.  I&#39;ve already reviewed it.&amp;nbsp; Check it out.&amp;nbsp; Oops, sorry I&#39;m slow... can&#39;t find it.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/806554256683693237'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/806554256683693237'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/speaking-of-role-playing.html' title='Speaking of Role Playing...'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1208217833002861431</id><published>2014-10-16T08:03:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2014-10-16T08:34:23.807-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Innovations in Role Playing</title><content type='html'>Besides experimenting with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/graphing-relationships.html&quot;&gt;graph databases&lt;/a&gt;, Quakers in the 21st Century have options George Fox never did, such as to fully record Business Meetings on high bandwidth storage media for the Meeting Archives (picture a server farm, a rack space, if the meeting is big and old).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Traditionally, a recording clerk synthesizes a meeting&#39;s decisions into Minutes, and this practice should not be suspended.&amp;nbsp; Written minutes have a life of their own within a graph database.&amp;nbsp; However, if a remote Quaker wishes to (a) view and participate in real time and/or (b) record a response at a later time, an &quot;after thought&quot;, why disallow this on principle?&amp;nbsp; Which of the Quaker &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.friendsjournal.org/s-p-i-c-e-s-quaker-testimonies/&quot;&gt;SPICES testimonies&lt;/a&gt; says to only meet behind closed doors and never make any recordings?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The obvious answer is Business Meeting (a form of Meeting for Worship devoted to management and governance) contains confidential material sometimes and the &quot;need to know&quot; ethic predominates in Societies not given to idle gossip.&amp;nbsp; For this reason, real time access may indeed need to be limited to only invited / trusted remote parties.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, before a Business Meeting goes to the Meeting Archive, an editing step might be applied.&amp;nbsp; A skillful editor, like a skillful clerk, is not trying to change the sense of the meeting through censorship.&amp;nbsp; Editing is a way of sculpting and bringing out features, highlighting.&amp;nbsp; The Job Descriptions manual may need a new Role, though perhaps &quot;recording clerk&quot; already covers it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of roles:&amp;nbsp; remember the &lt;a href=&quot;http://qfp.quaker.org.uk/chapter/1/&quot;&gt;Advices&lt;/a&gt; from past clerks of Peace and Social Concerns: &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/threshing-session.html&quot;&gt;to not let Nominating rule the roost&lt;/a&gt; when it comes to activist participation.&amp;nbsp; Practice first, get nominated (or not) later.&amp;nbsp; How are people supposed to know you and your concerns well enough to nominate you if all you do is play wallflower and hope you get noticed?&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s no way to run a railroad.&amp;nbsp; Wade in and get noticed.&amp;nbsp; Flamboyance may be preferable to sulking.&amp;nbsp; Think about it.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1208217833002861431'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1208217833002861431'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/10/innovations-in-role-playing.html' title='Innovations in Role Playing'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5203077814875949756</id><published>2014-10-11T21:00:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2014-11-29T21:59:41.857-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Graphing Relationships</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/15511050085&quot; title=&quot;neo4j by Kirby Urner, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;neo4j&quot; height=&quot;291&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3949/15511050085_3e8b81e1de.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those of you who&#39;ve done most your bookkeeping or other record keeping with SQL, may have heard of NoSQL or &quot;not only&quot; SQL, but your mind flashes to something like Mongo or CouchDB, not to a graph database with a language like Cypher.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s still forgivable as graph databases are still relatively new players in the record keeping ecosystem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Neo4j depends on Java and gives you a web browser mashup that&#39;s a combination IDE / REPL and visualization portal.&amp;nbsp; For those of you not decoding:&amp;nbsp; IDE = interactive development environment; REPL = read / evaluate / print loop (interactive prompt); SQL = structured query language.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll see that above:&amp;nbsp; the $ is the interactive prompt and the box beneath, listing movie names, is what a MATCH query in the Cypher language came back with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting some &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/neonige&quot;&gt;basic / primitive Python API&lt;/a&gt; might be a next step, or maybe not.&amp;nbsp; I should probably just work out in native Neo for a couple weeks and build up my Cypher skills.&amp;nbsp; The command language &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/09/djangocon-talk.html&quot;&gt;front end&lt;/a&gt; would be like:&amp;nbsp; &quot;Make Ahmed clerk of Peace and Social Concerns for two years starting in 2014&quot;.&amp;nbsp; The Cypher would happen behind the scenes.&amp;nbsp; Something like WikiWords might come in handy, to keep the parsing part easy.&amp;nbsp; If you prefer to write Cypher directly, more power to you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then a clerk could query using syntax like:&amp;nbsp; &quot;show all previous members of Peace and Social Concerns with the percent of regular meetings they attended&quot;.&amp;nbsp; This might be a Nominating clerk query.&amp;nbsp; One wants reliable attenders usually, though some people have pre-agreements that could also be encoded e.g. members who live in another city half the year, the case with Carol.&lt;br /&gt;

Very cool that the author focuses on The Iron 
Bridge as an entry point, a science fiction novel about a time traveler 
sent back from a future that&#39;s decided humans had industrialized too 
early, before their thinking had matured enough to handle it (witness 
the World Wars the followed).  In this future, the planetary ecosystem 
is messed up beyond repair.  Industrialization must be delayed.  So she 
(the time traveler) is to sabotage the Iron Bridge, built by industrious
 Quakers who treated their workers fairly well.  Hence the book&#39;s claim 
that Quakers not only practiced &quot;total capitalism&quot; (from foundry to 
factory to wholesale to retail) but did it in such away as to give 
&quot;total socialism&quot; a run for its money, i.e. they treated their workers 
relatively well.  Quakers reach an apogee in power and influence around 
1781 when the bridge opens.  Given their socially unpopular positions in
 the US, anti Indian Wars and anti slavery, their Quaker utopia 
(Pennsylvania) is already on the wane, but that&#39;s another story.  This 
book is more about the UK and the difference Quakers made there.&lt;br /&gt;

This handsome, beautifully illustrated primer is
 authored by a career geodesic dome engineer with a sense of the big 
picture, including the history.  I found plenty of mathematical trail 
heads leading off in various directions, all worth exploring, with a 
core of spherical trigonometry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, my own writing is in the 
bibliography, which may color my opinion, but to me this just means 
Edward Popko (whom I have not met) was extremely thorough and really did
 his homework for this tome, including exploring a lot of obscure 
topics.  Amy Edmondson&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/061518314X/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk&quot;&gt;A Fuller Explanation: The Synergetic Geometry of R Buckminster Fuller&lt;/a&gt; is likewise cited, helping weave together a story that is still unfolding today.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

Also today, in addition to chauffeuring a friend with a hip replacement around, I joined some women at the waterfront, East Side Esplanade at Salmon, for a quick photo shoot in honor of of the ongoing global &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commondreams.org/news/2014/10/03/campaigners-stage-global-day-action-against-killer-and-surveillance-drones&quot;&gt;Kites Not Drones campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

It&#39;s a misappropriation of technology.

I rounded out the day at a local temple (Newar Buddhist), on invitation from a friend.  Classical Indian ragas sung by an older guy, accompanied by traditional instruments, who knew what he was doing.  My ears took awhile to adjust but then that&#39;s part of the process.  By the end, we were pretty much all on the same page.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m in no position to write any comprehensive review of this event.&amp;nbsp; Good job &lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt; on the lunch.&amp;nbsp; Carol (mom) was especially keen to go as she&#39;d been to the Social Forum in Detroit and been on organizing committees for Forums before this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This year the plan was to fragment the global event among several cities, so that more people from diverse locales could maybe make it to one of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was not the same church as where we have the ISEPP lectures.&amp;nbsp; First Unitarian is not First Congregational.&amp;nbsp; Both have ample facilities, with the Unitarians also having Eliot Center, the site of many a social event in Portland, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/10/barcamp-4.html&quot;&gt;some Barcamps&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve attended (that&#39;s a computer thing, not a camp for bartenders).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ibrahim was the one panelist I could claim to know by name.&amp;nbsp; He came up to Carol and I later and introduced himself in a friendly way.&amp;nbsp; I reminded him he knows Lindsey (housemate), who would have dug this event; she&#39;s still in Nepal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Luchini family was in high gear with both parents leading breakout sessions.&amp;nbsp; However it&#39;s not like I was able to recognize many faces.&amp;nbsp; Portland is a small city, but not &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; small.&amp;nbsp; More it was the issues, causes and agendas that I recognized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Using the term &quot;capitalism&quot; to encapsulate / name a broken operating system, buggy and disreputable, is part of the common core vocabulary, though I wouldn&#39;t call this an unexamined nomenclature.&amp;nbsp; During questions to the panelists, the door was left open to embrace aspects of the &quot;current system&quot; but given the heterogeneous makeup of the group, having a common vocabulary is an asset and after cost / benefit analysis it seems &quot;capitalism&quot; is indeed the common foe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Somewhat ironically, I&#39;d scheduled the middle of the day to photograph houses on the market for some people looking to move to Portland and so was out and about playing the language game of home ownership after lunch.&amp;nbsp; Then I settled down on the back deck with &lt;i&gt;Nietzsche, Godfather of Fascism?&lt;/i&gt; to read some of the anthologized writings therein. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
English must be versatile and fertile enough to come up with other isms, for those wishing for neither social-ism nor capital-ism.&amp;nbsp; Those can&#39;t be the only two choices.&amp;nbsp; This book &lt;i&gt;Quakernomics&lt;/i&gt; I&#39;ve been reading suggests capitalism is not intrinsically oppressive, if placed at the service of alternative value systems.&amp;nbsp; Maybe.&amp;nbsp; Why call it &quot;Quaker capitalism&quot; instead of just &quot;Quakerism&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why not just advertise an openness to a plethora of small scale experiments (no &quot;winner take all&quot; rules need apply), with some doubling as a basis for video programming, such that onlooker-viewers may judge for themselves what&#39;s an appealing lifestyle?&amp;nbsp; We already do that a lot already.&amp;nbsp; Let&#39;s do it a lot more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We (humanity) can practice hundreds if not thousands of isms and individual humans need not see themselves as trapped by any one of them, anymore than bees are trapped by flowers (unless they&#39;re flowers of the insect-eating variety).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Engineering subcultures are not by definition the enemy so much as potential infrastructure providers, stage crews, for giving the various isms space to flourish and recruit.&amp;nbsp; Architecture is a branch of engineering in this vocabulary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aren&#39;t religious communities &quot;socialist&quot; in that the devotees of whatever flavor share assets / property?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in that sense isn&#39;t an aircraft carrier shared property as well?&amp;nbsp; Who on board has title?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A captain of a ship is so often not its owner, nor are the admirals typically in owners of their fleets, or why would socialists have them?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Political terminology is full of holes.&amp;nbsp; Why stake one&#39;s life on such hole-ridden texts?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The capitalist in me says risking everything to defend &quot;capitalism&quot;, one ism among many, is not a good business investment.&amp;nbsp; Isms come and go.&amp;nbsp; The 1800s need not dictate the terms of our debates going forward.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5717677905806455003'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5717677905806455003'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/09/pacific-northwest-social-forum.html' title='Pacific Northwest Social Forum'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1774774220110764564</id><published>2014-09-22T13:42:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2014-09-25T06:11:50.334-07:00</updated><title type='text'>El Topo (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;El Topo&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;The Mole&quot;) incorporates many tropes from the Western, but also the martial arts film.&amp;nbsp; A story line wherein a wannabe confronts successively higher masters and fights them, perhaps to the death, is taken up &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Death&quot;&gt;by Bruce Lee&lt;/a&gt;, with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar one of the masters he fights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As someone well versed in the Buckminster Fuller legacy, I have to comment on Master Two&#39;s splendid collection of toothpick vector matrices, including a painstakingly constructed isotropic vector matrix of considerable size, which our anti-hero destroys.&amp;nbsp; Got me thinking about Russell Chu, a patient toothpick IVM builder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The anti-hero goes on to confront his own son, now a grown man, as yet another master he must overcome.&amp;nbsp; If we take &quot;killing&quot; as a metaphor for simply &quot;comprehending&quot; then we might restore the gory foreground to the status of tantric dream (cartoon-verse or whatever).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The anti-hero is driven into the priesthood by &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/terminal-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;a love triangle&lt;/a&gt;, getting &quot;crucified&quot; on a bridge in a scene aptly named Betrayal on the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yoko and John Lennon appreciated this film and Jodorowsky&#39;s talent more generally.&amp;nbsp; He&#39;s both the director and a main actor in this comic book South American western.&amp;nbsp; I can see why.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, the son, the mole, is vastly understaffed and underfunded and his alchemy experiment proves a calamity and he experiences game over, probably doomed to replay this level at some level.&amp;nbsp; Reintegration of &quot;the other&quot; into &quot;polite society&quot; or whatever the towns people signify, is clearly a dicey game, explosive, and without careful management and supervision, was bound to go awry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The DVD itself gets a lot of credits i.e. restoration of the original film to its DVD state, complete with an interview (engaging) with Jodorowsky, which leaves me wondering if the somewhat rough cut editing is an artifact of restoration.&amp;nbsp; I think more likely it&#39;s what I&#39;d call the &quot;comic book style&quot; of this kind of movie making.&amp;nbsp; Things happen abruptly sometimes, just like in real life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In trying to turn his rescued significant other into a shaman, like himself, she appears to bifurcate into two people (my reading) at first conflicted, but growing self-assured enough to stand on her own and engage in a separate journey.&amp;nbsp; On this reading, it&#39;s maybe a triangle, but Mara is simply more in touch with herself and doesn&#39;t need to piggy back on her man, riding him Lady Macbeth style at first (given what she&#39;d been through, I can&#39;t say I blame her).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The anti-hero, in the meantime, has a lot of father-son issues to work through and so isn&#39;t really prepared for a girlfriend.&amp;nbsp; He needs to deal with not being in control for a change.&amp;nbsp; Part Two of the film (the film somewhat divides in two) traces the anti-hero&#39;s continued maturation, this time against the backdrop of the mole&#39;s alchemy project, which he undertook by popular demand in a spirit of public service, a politician of sorts.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1774774220110764564'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1774774220110764564'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/09/el-topo-movie-review.html' title='El Topo (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5620263599474897211</id><published>2014-09-17T16:01:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2023-08-23T11:00:20.234-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Slutwalk 2014</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;a data-flickr-embed=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/albums/72157647727667125&quot; title=&quot;Slutwalk PDX&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/5561/15219149286_60a3cacb71.jpg&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; alt=&quot;Slutwalk PDX&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This crowd was on the cerebral side, regardless of dress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The speeches were pitched to a high level and I overheard someone way a lot of St. Mary&#39;s students were in the crowd, a premier Catholic school not unlike St. Dominic Academy where I taught math and sundry subjects in the early 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The protestors were basically advocating for &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/2nd-life-2nd-world.html&quot;&gt;Second Life rules&lt;/a&gt; in First Life insofar as &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/12/avatar-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; presentation goes.&amp;nbsp; Dress or don&#39;t dress your avatar however you like:&amp;nbsp; nothing about your dress code implies consent and/or a willingness to provide favors, sexual or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/speakers-lounge.html&quot;&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt; around Portland State University and other places is clear:&amp;nbsp; women, and men, can dress how they like within whatever boundaries the courts would uphold (e.g. going stark naked is still not accepted public &quot;attire&quot; except in designated areas), and no aspect of one&#39;s costume or dress should be considered &quot;an invitation&quot; as in &quot;but she dressed like a slut, your honor&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Understood?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Put in other terms, guys have no right to behave like dicks no matter how women dress or undress themselves.&amp;nbsp; &quot;Consent mode&quot; and &quot;dress code&quot; are two different concepts.&amp;nbsp; Don&#39;t confuse them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Get it yet?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some in the crowd were professional dancers who considered their performance art very far from an invitation to random others to assume anything about their willingness to have any specific type of relationship.&amp;nbsp; Portland has a lot of strip clubs.&amp;nbsp; These are supposed to enforce a professional code that keeps the dancers safe from non-consensual intimacy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The main speech maker declaimed sorrow at even needing to hold such an event / protest as the rights being asserted should simply go without saying.&amp;nbsp; To have to fight for the right to never have non-consensual sex:&amp;nbsp; why again is that even up for debate?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the Code of Conduct is clear, I&#39;m not for a moment saying it&#39;s necessarily a simple matter to resolve every dispute wherein an aggrieved party alleges non-consent after the fact.&amp;nbsp; Many a soap opera has featured a betrayal wherein an innocent party becomes the target of a criminal accusation, for whatever motive (revenge, blackmail etc.), or wherein a perpetrator protests innocence by alleging such a motive on the part of the aggrieved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Soap operas sometimes make matters easy for the audience as there&#39;s often a &quot;fly on the wall&quot; point of view (the camera) giving the inside story.&amp;nbsp; Usually a jury of one&#39;s peers, or the court of public opinion, as the case may be, will not have the luxury of such a viewpoint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s where the police and detective shows come in, along with the lawyer shows.&amp;nbsp; Our TV channels are awash in such stuff.&amp;nbsp; At St. Dominic Academy, they almost all watched &lt;i&gt;General Hospital&lt;/i&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5620263599474897211'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5620263599474897211'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/09/slutwalk-2014.html' title='Slutwalk 2014'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3910233867443384387</id><published>2014-09-09T18:13:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2014-09-09T18:21:28.939-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Sounding Some Themes</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I told the story of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/07/wanderers-meeting-200575.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;CareWheels&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as I knew it, to &lt;i&gt;791 Techologies&lt;/i&gt; in Canada.&amp;nbsp; That was Ron Braithwaite&#39;s project.&amp;nbsp; I hung out with &lt;i&gt;791&lt;/i&gt; people at &lt;i&gt;DjangoCon&lt;/i&gt; a lot, as they were among the top sponsors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m settling in to this routine where I meet at &lt;i&gt;Red Square&lt;/i&gt; wearing my AFSC Liaison hat and swap papers around with the Multnomah Meeting Communications Clerk.&amp;nbsp; Sounds &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/toontown.html&quot;&gt;very toontown&lt;/a&gt; doesn&#39;t it, like out of some Hollywood movie.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Red Square&lt;/i&gt; is just a coffee shop and the Portland AFSC is moving closer to Stark Street, so it&#39;s convenient for me &#39;n Rick, both Friends, to chat over coffee sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Holden is in Sebastopol I&#39;m pretty sure, with Carol on her way from LAX right now.&amp;nbsp; Melody got a voicemail from the away team near Kathmandu, still heading for the Rotary-sponsored women&#39;s clinic so far as we know.&amp;nbsp; Glad to meet up with Jen and Yarrow again, and to finally meet Melody&#39;s dad.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/05/beltane.html&quot;&gt;Uncle Bill&lt;/a&gt; is training over from Seattle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wanderers will likely celebrate the Solstice on the 19th, which for me will likely start at Colonel Summers where I&#39;m still active with &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/fnb-food-prep.html&quot;&gt;the SE FNB chapter&lt;/a&gt; (that&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Food Not Bombs&lt;/i&gt;, lots in these blogs about the local group, with some links to global resources).&amp;nbsp; FNB was hosted by the Quaker meetinghouse on Stark Street for about a year, when Blue House was also providing more logistical support.&amp;nbsp; We were more of a hub back then.&amp;nbsp; Our main supplier moved and Lindsey found more time to work on music after that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
OK, enough with the random notes, gives the flavor.&amp;nbsp; Sounding some earlier themes, keeping my storylines going.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;CareWheels&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Some good thinking went into that project.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;ve also been &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9589726&quot;&gt;hyping Fibonacci Numbers&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;i&gt;math-teach&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; So what else is new?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Is that what&#39;s meant by Attention Deficit? &amp;nbsp;There&#39;s nothing wrong with an attention span of only three minutes, if you keep coming back for another three minutes often enough to keep up with the workflow. &amp;nbsp;That&#39;s how our interrupt driven computers work. &amp;nbsp;The operating system&#39;s whole job is to multitask intelligently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sure, some tasks take sustained attention for a lot longer than that, but lets hear it for the ones that don&#39;t, or don&#39;t always.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In that spirit, I welcome the chance to plunge into &lt;i&gt;Quakernomics&lt;/i&gt; on my Samsung Galaxy Tablet (10.1&quot;) from time to time, or maybe on my Razr when riding a bus. &amp;nbsp;That book poses interesting questions especially seen in contrast with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080142/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wobblies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 1979 documentary I just reviewed (I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;d seen it already, or maybe parts of it).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The IWW was sure no form of capitalism could be benign whereas &lt;i&gt;Quakernomics&lt;/i&gt; makes the case that nothing intrinsic to capitalism says that system must be miserly-miserable. &amp;nbsp;But then &lt;i&gt;Quakernomics&lt;/i&gt; is very broad brush stroke with what it means by &quot;capitalism&quot; casting Quakers as most definitely capitalists, in contrast with the Marxists who sometimes ridiculed their mendacious ways. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Likewise the book &lt;i&gt;Debt: &amp;nbsp;The First 5000 Years&lt;/i&gt;, also on my Kindle app, is broad brush stroke with its meaning of &quot;communist&quot;, making it mean almost any community-centric economy, any sangha. &amp;nbsp;So much ideological &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/warfaring&quot;&gt;warfaring&lt;/a&gt; depends on loose definitions or, same thing, breaks down as definitions come under closer scrutiny. &amp;nbsp;&quot;We&#39;re not in conflict, we&#39;re just working in different namespaces.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Prohibition&lt;/i&gt; by Ken Burns is a masterpiece of storytelling. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;d never associated &lt;i&gt;Happy Days are Here Again&lt;/i&gt; so closely with the repeal of Prohibition, preceded by FDR&#39;s legalizing 3.2% beer by executive order (a master stroke). &amp;nbsp;I&#39;ve always taken legal drinking (for those of legal age) for granted, my generation having been imprisoned &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/08/the-house-i-live-in-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;for similar offenses&lt;/a&gt; the Burns documentary avoids mentioning, despite obvious parallels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Building up beer as a specifically and endearingly German thing, to postpone Prohibition, really backfired come the demonization of Germans and their culture during WW1. &amp;nbsp;That, and the passage of a Federal Income Tax turned the saloon-keeper caste and their suppliers into outlaws. &amp;nbsp;The US had a new source of income and a profitable war to prosecute.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Truly, the &quot;saloon&quot; as an all male club, a symbol of anti-female apartheid, pre women having the vote etc., did not survive into the mid 1900s. &amp;nbsp;More accurately, gender stereotypes broke down under the pressures of industrialized city living and typecasting based on gender (and &quot;race&quot;) became less and less tenable for &lt;i&gt;any &lt;/i&gt;institution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia_Massacre_%28Washington%29&quot;&gt;The Wobblies&lt;/a&gt; sure liked to sing a lot. &amp;nbsp;When you have a pre literate and, more important, pre Web culture, propagating ideology through lyrics (and prayers) makes sense. &amp;nbsp;And these are not songs to kick back and listen to, they&#39;re songs to sing oneself. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&#39;s a lot less public singing in groups these days, is my impression. &amp;nbsp; We have become a culture of spectators on the one hand, and amplified / recorded celebrity-pro singers on the other, with new institutions to break down that difference: &amp;nbsp;karaoke bars (and of course &quot;church choirs&quot; are still popular), and &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/03/hb2u-youtube.html&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These two films, on Prohibition and the IWW, in combination with &lt;i&gt;To Be Takei&lt;/i&gt; with its focus on the internment of Japanese Americans, provides a ton of information about the &quot;culture wars&quot; that North Americans have been fighting. &amp;nbsp;Prohibition had everything to do with trying to legislate lifestyle choices with one caste (cast) feeling entitled to dictate to another. &amp;nbsp;Prohibition was &quot;cast warfare&quot;. Criminalize that of which you disapprove, is the &quot;moralistic solution&quot; Americans tend to favor, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/lost-city-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;great cost&lt;/a&gt; to their living standards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, we might intelligibly replace the notion of &quot;class&quot; with that of &quot;cast&quot; (as in theater), as ultimately it&#39;s a matter of role playing. &amp;nbsp;Cultures are role playing games, pure and simple. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s just they take themselves so seriously that saying &quot;game&quot; sounds offensive (too jokey, too light), especially to hardliner ideologues of whatever true faith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The IWW fought hard for the eight hour work day, and for Freedom of Speech. &amp;nbsp;The documentary is brilliant in that it shows press accounts being predictably and routinely anti-IWW, making the point, in case it wasn&#39;t clear, that newspapers are a tool of one cast more than others. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Demonizing the IWW as either German or Russian agents helped Americans confuse the two, helping with &lt;a href=&quot;http://grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html&quot;&gt;the Great Pivot&lt;/a&gt; under the Dulles Brothers, when Germany and Japan (former enemies) became allies against Vietnam and Russia (former allies).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of demonizing Russians, I also squeezed in at least part of Season One of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2149175/&quot;&gt;The Americans&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; set during the Reagan Years. &amp;nbsp;I won&#39;t try reviewing that here though, beyond acknowledging its relevance.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6328296770824301257'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6328296770824301257'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/08/more-documentaries.html' title='More Documentaries'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-6049280277723618362</id><published>2014-08-24T08:21:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2014-08-24T16:55:40.011-07:00</updated><title type='text'>To Be Takei (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/15013672911&quot; title=&quot;DSCF1264 by Kirby Urner, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;DSCF1264&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3889/15013672911_1751f3bf18.jpg&quot; width=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s &quot;Tah-Kay&quot; not &quot;Tah-Kai&quot; as the movie makes clear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What strikes me about George Takei are the similarities between his story and that of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/03/remembering-baryard-rustin.html&quot;&gt;Kiyoshi Kuromiya&lt;/a&gt;, another Japanese American who &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/02/adult-first-day-program.html&quot;&gt;incurred internment&lt;/a&gt; and a resulting life-long commitment to activism in defense of civil liberties, including gay rights.&amp;nbsp; Kiyoshi and I used to hang out some in Philadelphia, when I&#39;d fly there for AFSC meetings.&amp;nbsp; He was likewise kind and brilliant, also focused on personal integrity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being gay is an orientation, not a lifestyle, George likes to point out.&amp;nbsp; If it&#39;s &quot;a choice&quot; so is being in mixed-sex relationships a &quot;choice&quot; i.e. it cuts both ways, yet many mixed-sex oriented don&#39;t think of it as &quot;a choice&quot; for them.&amp;nbsp; Well ditto.&amp;nbsp; That was reasoning by a standup comic we heard later that same evening, but it fits as analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The documentary advances its threads in a multitasking way, an effective way of storytelling in that you get three minutes here, seeing the marriage equality campaign move forward, then three minutes there playing up the Star Trek lore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s illuminating about this film is how it&#39;s highly media literate within what&#39;s popularly called &quot;pop culture&quot; so we get inside Howard Stern&#39;s radio show and into magazines and tabloids, visiting a lot of edgy comedy.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s why the later show by Dick Foley and company at &lt;i&gt;The Helium&lt;/i&gt; was so dead on, including more gay jokes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like a lot of the stranger-fans in the movie, waiting in line for picture signings and so on, I&#39;m a Takei friend on Facebook.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever posted to his profile or commented thereon, but I&#39;ve really liked some of his funnies.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m think of myself as a subscriber in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The movie spends some time on how Asians get portrayed in films.&amp;nbsp; Yes, a fencing sword is less &quot;stereotypical&quot; than a samurai sword one could say, but getting all martial arty and Bruce Lee like is hardly &quot;out of character&quot; for an Asian male.&amp;nbsp; They seem to do that a lot.&amp;nbsp; Not just Errol Flynn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The interlude about a fantasy Kirk-Spock relationship kicked up by the collective unconscious for Internet consciousness, is hilarious.&amp;nbsp; ROTFLOL.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The musical George has been working on, &lt;i&gt;Allegiance&lt;/i&gt;, is another one of those threads we see advanced.&amp;nbsp; Here in the Pacific Northwest, from where I&#39;m writing, this musical would have special poignancy.&amp;nbsp; Perhaps we&#39;ll see it in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
People make fun of Newtonian mechanics for being &quot;mechanistic&quot; (duh) meaning &quot;clock-like&quot; which is where delta calculus hails from: &amp;nbsp;the world of gear-works and their ratios. &amp;nbsp;How quickly does this gear turn relative to that one? &amp;nbsp;dy/dx comes from there. &amp;nbsp;You&#39;re trying to reverse engineer nature by modeling her as a clock-works. &amp;nbsp;Sure it&#39;s primitive, but it actually works pretty well when it comes to planetary orbits and what not, even if we admit to chaotic elements.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The figure below, singled out by Glenn Stockton from the many images flying through his workspace, provides a fine summary of rotational motions &quot;in principle&quot; i.e. what you&#39;d expect just thinking about it, in a somewhat Kantian sense (synthetically a priori in other words):&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/14902766272/in/photostream/player/&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&#39;ve got the magnetic field thing going, as a kind of involution / evolution of toroidal (donut) shape, then the revolving and orbital-precessional. &amp;nbsp;The solar system &quot;corkscrews&quot; whereas in profile it&#39;s sinusoidal, which means sine waves. &amp;nbsp;We should talk about sine waves more, and their oscilloscope values. &amp;nbsp;Trigonometry remains such a key, don&#39;t let e to an imaginary power divert your attention from the underlying rotational phenomenon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rate of change at which something changes gets us back to that &quot;trim tab&quot; idea of the butterfly effect. &amp;nbsp;Butterflies do not in fact cause climate change individually, yet are a part of the climate collectively, and deltas in butterfly cultures may indeed serve as canary-in-mineshaft warnings or positive omens, of big wheels turning in a helpful or harmful direction (you need a model to figure out about preferences, and a value system).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/30104372148635588'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/30104372148635588'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/08/delta-calculus.html' title='Delta Calculus'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-4910111461357810108</id><published>2014-08-09T10:14:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2014-08-09T22:45:04.735-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Holy Toledo</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Now I&#39;m having a cup of tea with my British friend Steve.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tonight&#39;s topic was the history of the Middle East (so-called) since around the time of the Ottoman Empire, with the rise of industrialism in Europe posing new challenges and giving rise to many new artificial states, such as Lebanon (a French project) and Jordan (British).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The French helped give &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maronites&quot;&gt;the Maronites&lt;/a&gt; in Lebanon a boost before leaving, while Britain in drawing in Jordan, as a state, was compensating &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali,_Sharif_of_Mecca&quot;&gt;some Caliph&lt;/a&gt; for allowing Iraqi Muslims to be conscripted against Turkish Muslims (Arabs against Ottomans).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was interested to learn more about ISIS given that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/08/visiting-downtown-detroit.html&quot;&gt;demonstration in Detroit&lt;/a&gt; we&#39;d come across.&amp;nbsp; Christians and other ethnic minorities are feeling the boot of some rival gang as it takes over along various transportation corridors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Religious gangs are not a new phenomenon and one Thirster piped up with analogies between sectarian violence in Europe (Catholic versus Protestant for some hundreds of years) and what we were looking at here.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d say that goes without saying.&amp;nbsp; Humans are fairly predictable beasts of &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/jihad.html&quot;&gt;limited bandwidth&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; They argue about a lot of the same things all through time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So I hadn&#39;t realized this spooky subset of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelver&quot;&gt;Shi&#39;a&#39;s Twelvers&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alawites&quot;&gt;Alawites&lt;/a&gt;, were so in control &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/08/city-of-morons.html&quot;&gt;in Syria&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/01/cyber-nations.html&quot;&gt;faux state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#39;s not that only &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; states are faux; they&#39;re &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; faux, it&#39;s just some get all offended when you point out their fauxness, whereas others are more reconciled to their being phony.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/01/thirsters-gather.html&quot;&gt;Thirsters&lt;/a&gt; have been meeting for many years, thanks to founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/synergeo/conversations/topics/70918&quot;&gt;Bob Textor&lt;/a&gt;, anthropologist and a valued contributor to the design the Peace Corps in its early days, during the Bill Moyers and Lyndon Johnson years (early to mid 1960s).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our presenter tonight was Bill Beeman.&amp;nbsp; From the Thirsters listserv:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;tr_bq&quot;&gt;
Bill is an internationally known expert on the Middle East and the Islamic&lt;br /&gt;
World, particularly Iran, the Gulf Region and Central Asia. He has also&lt;br /&gt;
conducted research in Japan, India, Nepal, China and Europe. From 1996-1999&lt;br /&gt;
he sang professionally in Europe as an operatic bass. He continues his&lt;br /&gt;
musical career. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
One of the Thirsters piped up during Q&amp;amp;A, asking if Al Qaeda was as advertised &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;in &lt;i&gt;The Power of Nightmares&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a largely imaginative projection, not unlike &quot;Mafia&quot; or &quot;organized crime&quot;.&amp;nbsp; Bill said that it was, though he hadn&#39;t seen that BBC series, which I&#39;ve written up and oft linked to from within this blog.&amp;nbsp; Once the demonizing had begun, Al Qaeda offices sprung up all over, like &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/neverland-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Symbionese Liberationists&lt;/a&gt; in the days of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/cry-baby-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Patty Hearst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;
&lt;i&gt;:: picking up mom at Wayne State after the WILPF conference ::&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Hertz&lt;/i&gt; really came through for us.&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/07/visiting-heartland.html&quot;&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Mazda 2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was about the smallest car I could get away with given mom&#39;s walker needing to fit in the back, plus luggage for three people, but we were traveling light and the car proved peppy and up to the job, of traversing I-75 and I-70 both ways, from Michigan to Indiana, for a total of four times at about twelve hundred miles all told.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We got to Detroit airport (Wayne County International) in the pouring rain, though the return lot was sheltered.&amp;nbsp; Glenn, a paratrooper from the 101st airborne, based at Fort Campbell under General Westmoreland in the Vietnam era, graciously took us right to US Airways (merging with American) rather than have us take the Hertz passenger bus.&amp;nbsp; He was my idea of a good chauffeur.&amp;nbsp; I was saying all this to the Hertz feedback form on the web, suggesting a new &quot;car with driver&quot; rental service, but the web form just took me to an apology about the feedback form not working -- after entering reservation number, confirmation number and everything.&amp;nbsp; So it&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hertz&lt;/i&gt; IT that&#39;s suffering.&amp;nbsp; Glenn, on the front lines, is doing his job well (and thanks to Melvin the bus driver too, when coming in).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Best Western&lt;/i&gt; was a comedy of errors.&amp;nbsp; The housekeeping service verified I hadn&#39;t checked out just because the room was bare (I&#39;d taken my things elsewhere for washing), plus the cables on the desk were an indication I was still there, plus I walked in with leftover Thai food for the fridge and verified I was still an active guest.&amp;nbsp; OK, so then why did they take those vital cables from me and lock them up, and not tell the night manager?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The desk manager next morning knew about my fussing and said cleaning would unlock them by 10 am.&amp;nbsp; But by then I&#39;d already (a) replaced the micro-USB at &lt;i&gt;WalMart&lt;/i&gt;, needing to charge my phone and (b) bought and returned a Samsung cable, hoping the iPod one was compatible (I didn&#39;t even open the box, after Googling up the expected answer:&amp;nbsp; no way) so I (c) found a Samsung cable on-line for much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s not the end of it though.&amp;nbsp; I came back that night and yay, the cables were returned to my desk, but I&#39;d just pushed open the door, my card-key no longer working.&amp;nbsp; Kinda scary to have unkeyed access to all my stuff in a dark room.&amp;nbsp; Yes, dark.&amp;nbsp; No lights, no TV, no clock... no power.&amp;nbsp; The night manager went to some breaker box and tried throwing switches, no dice.&amp;nbsp; Lets move me to a different room.&amp;nbsp; Good thing my smartphone has a flashlight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, although the morning manager assured me the tub &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; send water through the overhead shower component, I didn&#39;t find pulling down on the O-ring in 227 actually doing anything.&amp;nbsp; The next room, 314, had the toggle on the top, and that worked well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Breakfasts were fine and the high speed Internet was reliable.&amp;nbsp; Also &lt;i&gt;Best Western&lt;/i&gt; IT works better than &lt;i&gt;Hertz&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s, as my survey / feedback form to the &quot;mother ship&quot; recounting these stories, took the data just fine -- or so it seemed as an end user.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;US Airways&lt;/i&gt; did a marvelous job getting us home, though Phoenix ground personnel get the standing ovation, for getting mom pushed to A10 from A-whatever, two different concourses even if all labeled A.&amp;nbsp; We only had about 50 minutes to make it happen.&amp;nbsp; I took all the bags on her walker and pushed alongside, moving quickly.&amp;nbsp; People with walkers and wheelchairs can&#39;t use the moving sidewalks.&amp;nbsp; The electric carts were already booked up helping other people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PDX Airport was a bit of a let down, which surprised me, as it&#39;s highly rated and respected.&amp;nbsp; But apparently even though they charge a gate fee to &lt;i&gt;US Airways&lt;/i&gt; for that after 1 AM flight, they&#39;re too cheap to man the exit on that whole side of the airport.&amp;nbsp; Sure, the baggage carrousel is way at the other end too (number 9) but does it have to be?&amp;nbsp; Why not let E-side people get their bags at 1 or 2?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom has a walker and walking from the very end of the E concourse, all the way across the airport to the C exit, down to 9 (by which time the bag was already on the &quot;unclaimed&quot; cart) was somewhat of an ordeal especially because it was so late at night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tired passengers, made to walk the extra mile, because PDX is too podunk to keep one of two major exits from the restricted area operational.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Asymmetry at work.&amp;nbsp; &quot;If you take flights arriving after 1 AM, you should provide exit services until at least 2 AM&quot; would be my memo to the Port of Portland (TSA has nothing to do with it).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, a wheelchair was offered but under normal circumstances the walker is all she needs.&amp;nbsp; No one warned us about the extra mileage we&#39;d be expected to put on.&amp;nbsp; The longer walk affected all passengers, not just us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like I said:&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/07/replacing-broken-camera.html&quot;&gt;first world problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/15579092005/player/&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;375&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tara tells me the critics have been unkind to this film and she left the theater saying &quot;too unkind&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m glad I saw it on a big screen&quot;.&amp;nbsp; My remarks were &quot;interesting how it had so much didactic content, like cutaways to documentary footage&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We agreed the science itself, as presented by Morgan Freeman, playing a scientist, was rather bogus.&amp;nbsp; I also remarked on the blueness of the crystals, how reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/i&gt;, and would this film help boost the demand for &quot;smart drugs&quot; if not &lt;a href=&quot;http://chemistry.about.com/od/medicalhealth/a/crystalmeth.htm&quot;&gt;crystal meth&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp; Certainly it plays off the meth meme.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&#39;s interesting about the film is it presents us with a superhero where smarts / knowledge is the superpower, not swinging from buildings (Spiderman), not physical strength (Superman).&amp;nbsp; Lucy gets lots of auxiliary powers from her amped up brain for sure (e.g. a kind of X-ray vision), but the core capability is purely gnostic.&amp;nbsp; I can&#39;t think of another superhero with &quot;intelligence&quot; verging on &quot;omniscience&quot; as the core capability, except maybe Spock in &lt;i&gt;Star Trek&lt;/i&gt;, who cultivates &quot;logic&quot;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Addendum&lt;/i&gt;:&amp;nbsp; co-worker John Baker reminded me later, during my stopover in Toledo:&amp;nbsp; Tony Stark as &lt;i&gt;Iron Man&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I would add:&amp;nbsp; the anti-hero / bad guy in &lt;i&gt;The Incredibles&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The aspect of &quot;enlightenment&quot; is present as well, and fulfilling a built-in human capability.&amp;nbsp; Shades of &lt;i&gt;Lawn Mower Man&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Time Machine&lt;/i&gt; by H.G. Wells.&amp;nbsp; But to what extent is her enhanced intelligence filling her with compassion and empathy, per the Buddha or Jesus?&amp;nbsp; She doesn&#39;t act very Jesus-like, converting her enemies to allies or turning the other cheek.&amp;nbsp; She does perform lots of miracles and could probably part the Red Sea towards the end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sense that she&#39;s running out of time and has to get it all done within maybe a day or two means she has to optimize in many ways, leading her to break the rules right and left.&amp;nbsp; She drives crazy and won&#39;t put her tray table up in the stowed and locked position, when preparing for landing.&amp;nbsp; She cuts to the chase in every interaction, interrupting her roommate / friend&#39;s girlie chatter with &lt;i&gt;House M.D.&lt;/i&gt; like diagnostic remarks, while handing her a prescription and walking out the door.&amp;nbsp; So a kind of gruff compassion then.&amp;nbsp; She retains her humanity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fact that time is running out means we don&#39;t have to get into long term scenarios like manipulating the stock market or building an empire -- the stereotypical things an omniscient might do. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was curious going in if there&#39;d be any reference to the prehistoric Lucy, the name for the fossilized hominid skeleton from Ethiopia we got to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/field-trip-to-seattle.html&quot;&gt;visit in Seattle&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Of course.&amp;nbsp; That Lucy is her name is drummed in from the opening scene, with the link to our hominid made right off the bat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&#39;s probably what I like most about the film:&amp;nbsp; despite the bogus science (we forgive science fiction taking liberties, Morgan Freeman acknowledges we&#39;re in that genre as we boost brain power in some hypothetical dimension) the movie does a lot to survey the evolutionary experiment called &quot;humans&quot;, taking us to lots of cities (ala the 007 franchise) and diving into the distant past (she travels in her office chair), meeting Lucy herself, as well as seeing dinosaurs and pterodactyls. Time is the only real dimension, we&#39;re given to learn.&amp;nbsp; Very &lt;i&gt;Synergetics&lt;/i&gt;, very Heraclitus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We get treated to lots of nature film clips and get to &quot;think about&quot; cells, anatomy, reproduction... lots of science memes, colorful and fast-moving.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s what I liked:&amp;nbsp; the didactic flavor.&amp;nbsp; The audience is treated to a hypothetical &quot;what it might be like to think in a connected big picture way&quot; -- an ISEPP lecture on steroids.&amp;nbsp; Fun.&amp;nbsp; Maybe more people will feel inspired to do some reading, get some education.&amp;nbsp; Good PR for STEM, and with a strong woman at the center.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Tara mentioned a few times, we have to consider that &lt;span class=&quot;itemprop&quot; itemprop=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Scarlett Johansson also plays &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Her&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, another super-intelligence (so yet another super smarty).&amp;nbsp; She&#39;s well suited to her role here, as a bitch-witch well able to handle herself in a world of cruel Asian Matrix-like, black-suited bad guys.&amp;nbsp; So yeah, a role model for girls being both badass and smart.&amp;nbsp; We need those.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/14618715249/in/photostream/player/&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;240&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although I had only a few hours in Detroit, I was eager to get a sense of its historical trajectory.&amp;nbsp; That a great city has many square miles of now uninhabitable structures is not really a surprise, as North Americans did not always build with the intention their structures last hundreds of years.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Huge swaths of urban acreage all across the industrialized east are well past their pull date.&amp;nbsp; You&#39;ll see this in Baltimore and from any train window in the northeast corridor.&amp;nbsp; I don&#39;t see this as an apocalyptic crisis, more just physics at work.&amp;nbsp; Rust never sleeps as they say.&amp;nbsp; Decay happens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, it&#39;s ironic that &quot;the big three&quot; (Motor City&#39;s car companies) colluded with government to wipe out city rail systems and pave over everything, to insure the motor car&#39;s monopolistic dominance of the landscape for almost a century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/14782403066/player/&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that we&#39;ve burned through over half the fossil fuel, the costs of maintaining all that infrastructure have become prohibitive and North Americans are fighting a losing battle against pot holes and shrubbery poking through pavement.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m glad our Mazda 2 had robust suspension as we bumped our way through the decaying streets (and broken parking meters) of downtown Detroit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mention parking meters because that first one, Friday morning, ate two quarters but gave zero time, so I moved to another one that ate two quarters for 30 minutes credit, but gave no credit for the third or fourth quarter.&amp;nbsp; Tara tried a dime.&amp;nbsp; No dice.&amp;nbsp; We were out of change.&amp;nbsp; I came back to find a $45 parking ticket on my windshield.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
Downtown Detroit is indeed blessed with these decaying empty gigantic buildings.&amp;nbsp; Some may be restored or are being restored, but others just need to come down, or stand there as tourist attractions for people like me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/14618662140/in/photostream/player/&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While on the topic, I told Tara my belief was the Twin Towers of NYC were built with a self destruct system as a prerequisite for anything that huge needing to come down someday, not because of any tragic catastrophe but because all buildings have a half-life.&amp;nbsp; Ditto Building 7.&amp;nbsp; Now that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bfyd2W7zYQ&quot;&gt;David Chandler&lt;/a&gt; is a member of Multnomah Meeting, we&#39;re likely to have more such conversations back in Portland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We also stumbled across a protest, against the brutal persecution of Christians in the Middle Eastern war zone, where the British drew some lines many political world maps still show to this day (not Fuller&#39;s).&amp;nbsp; Violence against ethnic groups is not a new phenomenon and North America swelled in population precisely because humans were fleeing persecution in the more populated areas of the eastern hemisphere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; msallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; oallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/14825155883/player/&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;320&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

Once humans were crowded together in America, that same ethnic violence arose.&amp;nbsp; Humans have a violent and ugly past and present.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;m not especially proud of this species.&amp;nbsp; I understand why many religions consider us a &quot;fallen&quot; experiment (as in &quot;failed&quot;).&amp;nbsp; The angels mock us with good reason.&lt;br /&gt;

Detroit does have a bit of a rail system they call a People Mover and there&#39;s a futuristic station downtown amidst all the urban decay, providing a stark contrast between the new millennium&#39;s early days, and the one gone by.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Revisiting the surge of Islam as a religion of peace and non-violence, but with a strongly defiant rhetoric, under the leadership of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noi.org/hon-elijah-muhammad/&quot;&gt;Elijah Muhammad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noi.org/hon-minister-farrakhan/&quot;&gt;Louis Farrakhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.malcolmx.com/about/bio.html&quot;&gt;Malcolm X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ali.com/&quot;&gt;Muhammed Ali&lt;/a&gt;, provides new perspective in 2014, over a decade after 911 and the new face of Islamophobia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&#39;m not suggesting the history of Islam has been non-violent (on the contrary), nor arguing the moral superiority of any particular religion in the abstract.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clearly the Nation of Islam in 1960s North America, during the time of the civil rights movement and the parallel rise of the Reverend Martin Luther King, a Christian minister, was all about countering some hundreds of years of oppression, by instilling both self-discipline and self-pride in its citizens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The idea that an Islamic spin better fit the urbane / urbanized rebellious while the civil rights movement appeared both more rural and integrationist was not a contrast I&#39;d considered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Christianity had proved itself unable to head off a Civil War, the Bible and its interpretations being used by pro-slavery churches and abolitionists alike.&amp;nbsp; No wonder a period of intense disillusionment followed, among a people that had been given little choice in religion by their slave masters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hadn&#39;t realized how the Supreme Court had reversed itself, using some logic relating to Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses and whether one&#39;s objection to war was across the board or pick and choose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A heavy-weight fighter cuts a violent aspect in demeanor and profession, but Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses were saying they&#39;d fight if it were clearly a Lamb&#39;s War (Quaker jargon) i.e. if they felt moved by the Spirit, commanded by God.&amp;nbsp; That&#39;s not quite the same thing as &quot;picking and choosing&quot; one&#39;s wars.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quakers are less about objecting to wars as to wars using outward weapons, which is about the only kind of war comprehensible to those doomed to think literally about everything.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Muhammad Ali is a quick study both inside and outside of the boxing ring.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was glad to attend Steve Holden&#39;s OSCON Survivor&#39;s Breakfast, as I&#39;d missed the party for the Program Chair. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This follow-up event gave me an opportunity to sit at Sarah Novotny&#39;s table and personally register my appreciation for the focus on inclusivity, non-profits, collaboration with other disciplines. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone seemed jazzed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/36818&quot;&gt;Andrew Sorenson&#39;s keynote&lt;/a&gt; the morning before, and I filled in more of a picture of the guy, highly regarded. &amp;nbsp;We were lucky to have him.&amp;nbsp; I&#39;d watched on Live Steam with somewhat choppy DSL, knowing I could go back to Youtube later (above).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another topic at this table was the 40 hour work week, which business analysts back to Henry Ford Sr. had discovered was a local optimum.&amp;nbsp; People need time to recharge and enjoy the fruits of their labors.&amp;nbsp; Without rewards, motivation drops away, and with it, productivity.&amp;nbsp; Yet many in management seem to have forgotten this wisdom, when it comes to exploiting a steady stream of young talent eager for a foot in the door and not realizing they&#39;re being set up for PTSD and &quot;pager hallucinations&quot; i.e. that feeling of being on call for possible emergencies 24/7.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Duncan told me&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/&quot;&gt;about Hy&lt;/a&gt;, a LISP dialect that&#39;s friendly with Python. &amp;nbsp;I&#39;m eager to learn more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At Tatiana&#39;s table, I learned about her pleasant chat with Tim O&#39;Reilly during the interview period at the O&#39;Reilly booth (my role was to be at the OST booth around then). &amp;nbsp;She continued the discussion about i18n (internationalization). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hadn&#39;t realized how prolific her father is, in the Portuguese language, sometimes including original translations from Sanskrit in his works. &amp;nbsp;Both her parents are university professors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By analogy, a future O&#39;Reilly title might go directly from Python to Portuguese and vice versa without going through English along the way i.e. this would not be a translation. &amp;nbsp;Tim said he was open to such proposals (but of course it would need to be something more concrete than a mere notion). &amp;nbsp;I am grateful to Tati for continuing &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9529179&quot;&gt;the conversation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In sum, much appreciation was expressed for the program managers and the assemblage of keynotes this year. &amp;nbsp;People seemed satisfied this was one of the best OSCONs ever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hilton provided a world class breakfast and I partook with gusto, having barely touched my food last night after some unfortunate mixing of food and beverage earlier. &amp;nbsp;But hey, I survived.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was glad Don Wardwell of Wanderers could join us. &amp;nbsp;He was able to take positive advantage of some of the networking opportunities a room full of such high caliber folks offers.&lt;br /&gt;
