The producers each have their own ways of promoting clandestine events. DJ Troy is managing logistics, including lighting. I&#39;m on projector, Walker on sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The framework is to support others showing up and wanting to take the floor, give us a presentation. A fully developed genre, say &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/11/autobiography-night.html&quot;&gt;the autobiography&lt;/a&gt;, might be a theme for an evening, to be continued at a later date. Our event this time is more political, given our &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Laughing Horse Collective&lt;/span&gt; connection, although I argued for a stronger engineering approach on the way over, warming up for providing my piece of the gig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps a missing ingredient, for adding down the road, is a community access television component. What community again? Well, we&#39;d like to include Portland, given that&#39;s where we are, and given the already mature cable TV market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, mixing our various media feeds is probably not best accomplished in real time? Just having our videographers present will possibly supply sufficient grist for our mills, plus give us more control over what goes out over the wire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast with ISEPP lectures, more like its plans for salons, this format presumes a choppier format, with Lightning Talks of five minutes or less strongly emphasized in early promotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re in a mid-sized venue pre-equipped for multi-media. Not every gathering will expect a DJ and live music, VHS tapes playing on random monitors, smoke machine, projected Internet content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of mix and match.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll also plan on showing some hypertoons, computed on the fly vs. pre-recorded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

Or is that wrong. Maybe Quakers are peaceful when it is convenient. I have no idea. Except I do know plenty of words are slung and thrown around at the meetings, not for happy reasons, or so I am informed by participants I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Kirby&lt;/span&gt;: When you&#39;ve turned away from outward use of outward weapons, that doesn&#39;t preclude you from being a vicious attack dog Karl Rover. Quakers are not about being polite all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were always being offensive, heckling preachers, refusing to doff their hats, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/major-barbara-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;inciting the masses&lt;/a&gt;. They were imprisoned routinely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many got sick of that treatment and decided to create a relative utopia called Pennsylvania instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Quakers lost control of their state when the in-flooding immigrants, hot off the boat, wanted to use tax money to fight &quot;Indians&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Quakers had been &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/07/some-quaker-pr.html&quot;&gt;enjoying peaceful relations&lt;/a&gt; with said native populations and wanted no war taxes levied. They were out-voted by a corrupt majority and Quakers have had &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/catholic-analysis.html&quot;&gt;relatively little influence&lt;/a&gt; on the internal affairs of Pennsylvania ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rising tide of stupidity that overwhelmed Pennsylvania then spread to the rest of the Lower48, now known as Dumbfuckistan to our inner circle (just kidding, there&#39;s no inner circle, if you&#39;ve ever seen the &quot;Quakers guts&quot; poster -- a blog topic of late:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/11/local-activism.html&quot;&gt;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/11/local-activism.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dick&lt;/span&gt;: his kind of aggressive verbal behavior is perceived as strength in the Friends&#39; circle, I suspect...

The aerial bombardment of Guernica was memorialized &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/dj-vu.html&quot;&gt;by Pablo Picasso&lt;/a&gt;.  Ernest Hemingway narrated a movie from the Loyalist perspective (those loyal to a democratic, parliamentarian Spain), showed it to the Roosevelts in their White House home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As those reading their history remember, the USA was already sick of the whole WW1 experience and was not anxious to rejoin the European adventure.  However the world was shrinking owing to the development of air transport, and those watching world events could see that failing to stop the invasion of Spain by the dictators would simply postpone the day of reckoning.  Many Americans got into the fight early, and this film chronicles the dedication of those called to nursing, helping mostly men on the front lines.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-about-narnia.html&quot;&gt;horror of modern warfare&lt;/a&gt; was just becoming apparent through newsreels.  That Americans weren&#39;t lining up to join in the madness is understandable, but the situation only got worse as Hitler and Mussolini were sensing their behavior was being reinforced, they had a free hand.  The ostensibly democratic governments of the USA, France and Great Britain, weren&#39;t really doing anything to get in their way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/03/pans-labyrinth-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Spanish first stand&lt;/a&gt; against what would become a terrible enemy was echoed elsewhere in the world where newly literate classes were eager to manage their own affairs with less bullying from some power elite.  Central governments were worried about communism.  In the USA, the eugenics movement was strong.  Plenty in the business class were backing fascism at first, not yet aware of the monsters in the making.  Hitler was still writing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mein Kampf&lt;/span&gt; from prison, consuming racist pseudo-science from Cold Spring Harbor and places, well funded North American think tanks, as documented &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.waragainsttheweak.com/&quot;&gt;in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;War Against the Weak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2074094950660802270'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2074094950660802270'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/11/into-fire-movie-review.html' title='Into the Fire (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3349210710511497521</id><published>2009-11-03T08:23:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2009-11-03T08:43:35.346-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Not Following Detroit</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;im&quot;&gt;[ typos fixed, hyperlinks-enhanced version of a math-teach posting @ Math Forum ]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Sun, Nov 1, 2009 at 7:18 AM,&lt;br /&gt;Domenico Rosa wrote:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/news/education/k_12/articles/2009/10/29/boston_publisher_enters_new_chapter_in_textbooks/&quot;&gt;Publisher enters new chapter in textbooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Houghton sells $40m high-tech teaching system&lt;br /&gt;&gt; By D.C.

Initiatives like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathfuture.wikispaces.com/&quot;&gt;Maria&#39;s Math 2.0&lt;/a&gt; will likely play a greater role in future curriculum writing than any dinosaur mass publishers &quot;back east&quot; (we tend to be snobbish out here, see &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/01/funny-story.html&quot;&gt;the east&lt;/a&gt;&quot; as about 10 years behind the times, with California only 3 years behind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Math Labs may use mostly recycled hardware, hand-me-down machines from the corporate sector and government agencies, although some of the more well-endowed get grants for new equipment.  Mostly the money needs to go for teacher training, as math teachers especially are expected to have IT-related skills (lest their &quot;technology in the classroom&quot; rhetoric sound empty and hollow -- just knowing how to use a scientific calculator is no excuse for numeric literacy, or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/numeracy0.html&quot;&gt;numeracy&lt;/a&gt;&quot; any more).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#39;m anticipating a lot of skepticism regarding Detroit&#39;s adoption strategies.

They enjoyed cooking up a storm for breakfast this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was in the back office patched into a Math 2.0 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wiziq.com/&quot;&gt;WizIQ discussion&lt;/a&gt;, featuring chat, web cams, white board, the works. We joined from many time zones, with our anchor in the Middle East this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our topic was &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathfuture.wikispaces.com/WikiEducator&quot;&gt;WikiEducator&lt;/a&gt; and was most informative. I&#39;m hoping to join a team that&#39;ll bring more spatial geometry to that wiki, including some of the more esoteric content my company is known for promulgating and producing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight, Halloween, Tara is off with her friends, working a different neighborhood. I joined the Bartons for a delightful dinner, then rushed over the &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Duke&#39;s&lt;/span&gt;.

It&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; all about &quot;seat time&quot; in these few factory-looking buildings scattered around town. Keep using those, but use actual houses for foreign exchange program, film some of your cooking shows in actual kitchens (many homes have nice ones) and fund families accordingly.  Let the parents get in on the act, as they need training as well, need food and shelter as a part of the deal (not just more debt in exchange for deferred gratification).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Insisting that the K-12 lifestyle simply stick in the same ruts that it&#39;s been in since the 1920s and before shows a lack of imagination.  Likewise teachers should have more options, such as a national program more like TSA that keeps them moving around, pinch hitting on teams, if that&#39;s the lifestyle they choose.  It&#39;s less about paying the big bucks than developing lifestyles with the perks all built in.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/more-bizmology.html&quot;&gt;Have teachers in caravans&lt;/a&gt;, dispatched to conferences and workshops, more like the traveling circus model.  Coordinate local projects.  It&#39;s a lot like development in the 3rd world, except there&#39;s not really a 3rd world any more, just the real one and the cyber one (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/2nd-life-2nd-world.html&quot;&gt;first and second&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people reading this are gonna think I&#39;m crazy to suggest any of this, but then think of the military, our &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/iron-mountain-revisted.html&quot;&gt;vast socialized system&lt;/a&gt; of pooled assets, government funded and ostensibly about providing training and equipment (fun, travel and adventure as the recruiters used to advertise).  Any country that is able to run that many young people through a government program on that scale, should be able to provide similar opportunities for civilians -- unless of course the plan is to keep civilians in squalor such that military service is their only realistic option, in service of imperial goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#39;t whine about how we have no resources to serve students with better opportunities on the one hand, while squandering billions to warehouse hundreds of thousands around the world, supplied with a vast inventory of high tech toys, including entire floating cities (aka &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/05/carrier-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;aircraft carriers&lt;/a&gt;).  I realize it&#39;s maybe not politically correct to link these two sectors, but to the rest of the world it seems obvious that the USA could do OK for itself, if it just stopped imagining itself as some kind of world conqueror on steroids.  Even students see the logic in that position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if it&#39;s just a matter of recruiting vast numbers of teachers to live like the boomers, supporting public schools as we know them, then it&#39;s not gonna work, that&#39;s pretty much a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many kids are eager to get out of those hell holes, would never voluntarily go back to support them.  Boomer-senior culture is not one to emulate, but to transcend, the sooner the better.  All boomers know how to do is whine about their crappy health care system and invade foreign countries yes?  Whatever they advise you to do, do something else, would be my advice (yes, I&#39;m a boomer, so there&#39;s some irony here).</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1610093104796644874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1610093104796644874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/10/thinking-outside-of-box.html' title='Thinking Outside of the Box'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-360923976474466698</id><published>2009-10-29T09:52:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-29T19:16:33.986-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Machuca (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378284/&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; could be viewed as a double feature with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/01/motorcycle-diaries-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Motorcycle Diaries&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in that it focuses on many of the same themes, namely the rise of political movements around a consciousness of class, if not also race.

They jump up and down and bang on pots and pans, playing commies versus snobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strife flares in a parent meeting at the school, where many of the moneyed blame the introduction of the economically disadvantaged for a rise in school violence and turn on the English-speaking priest.  Other privileged parents are more liberal, though are not outright Marxists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the tide turns against Allende and the military seizes power on 9-11, 1973 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/iron-mountain-revisted.html&quot;&gt;a coup&lt;/a&gt;), the disadvantaged are vengefully attacked, their ideology driven underground, and the Marxist sympathizing priests are muscled aside by the ruling Pinochet junta.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little window we get into the St. Patrick&#39;s curriculum shows that &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wanderers-20091013.html&quot;&gt;frank discussion of events of the day&lt;/a&gt; and their historical context is not really what&#39;s up.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wanderers-20091013.html&quot;&gt;Civics, debating skills&lt;/a&gt;... not a part of this picture. The real world of social interaction and starkly contrasting lifestyles is more what kids learn about after school and during recess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is well acted by all concerned and provides a better doorway to history than dry texts alone.  I might assign readings &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-race.html&quot;&gt;along the lines of&lt;/a&gt; Bucky Fuller&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;No Race, No Class&lt;/span&gt; to go with it, plus I&#39;d encourage &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/recruiting-commercial.html&quot;&gt;critical questioning&lt;/a&gt; regarding the efficacy of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;politico-military solutions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/05/olpc-on-cbs.html&quot;&gt;One Laptop Per Child&lt;/a&gt; might be more of a step in the right direction, along with enlightened urban planning &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/illahee.html&quot;&gt;ala Mayor    Jaime Lerner&lt;/a&gt; of Curtiba, Brazil.

However the time has come to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/passing-torch.html&quot;&gt;pass the torch&lt;/a&gt; to a next generation of scholars and not hog the limelight.  Let&#39;s see if any competent Fuller commentators come out of the woodwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given academia has &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/lightning-talk-re-mites.html&quot;&gt;dropped the ball&lt;/a&gt;, it could be that we&#39;ll be skipping another generation or two.  It&#39;s pretty easy to explain the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/news-article-satire.html&quot;&gt;concentric hierarchy&lt;/a&gt; of polyhedra with its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/volumes.html&quot;&gt;tetravolumes&lt;/a&gt;, mites, sytes and kites.

&lt;br /&gt;
Lindsey organized this interesting event at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Laughing Horse Books&lt;/span&gt;, with James inviting some of his friends as well. We had a good turn out. The movie documentary, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Will: In Quotes&lt;/span&gt;, is boldly raw and would probably earn a TV-MA rating, even though visually it shows nothing more revealing than the occasional male torso, undergoing surgery in one scene (for breast implants).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The movie opens with Will frequenting karaoke bars in Boise, Idaho. He considers himself emotionally stunted or under-developed, albeit a decent singer. His strict religious upbringing in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/04/erratum.html&quot;&gt;polygamist Mormon household&lt;/a&gt; meant he wasn&#39;t allowed access to pop culture and now he&#39;s making up for lost time, seeking true love and a real family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even as a youngster, he&#39;d picked up glimmers of a &quot;trans-gendered&quot; type of person and concluded that his enduring sense of alienation might be an indication that he belonged in this category. Whereas most who entertain such fantasies wouldn&#39;t act on them, he figured while he was still young with no children or life partner, this was his time to explore. He begins chemically altering his body, his dress, and finally flies to Thailand for the operation, taking his own video camera, which he gives to a nurse when it&#39;s time to go under. By this time she&#39;s Claire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What made this experience especially dramatic and instructive for the audience was the star of this film had agreed to show up in person to answer questions. He&#39;s transitioning back to a male identity, is James now, having gone as far down the road being Claire as he wanted to go. He&#39;s somewhat embarrassed by the film and what people say to the film maker behind his back, so wanted to get a text message when it was over. This added to the theatrical nature of the event, plus the fact that he showed up in sunglasses with a scarf around his head, somewhat reminiscent &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/slowing-down.html&quot;&gt;of Michael Jackson&lt;/a&gt;. As the Q&amp;amp;A ensued, he shed the scarf, and by the end of the evening was minus the shades as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What impresses me about James, more than his &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/on-individualism-transcendentalism.html&quot;&gt;personal journey&lt;/a&gt;, is his brutal honesty. He has no skeletons to hide, is out of the closet with his thoughts and feelings to a point most people would never allow. This is a somewhat constant aspect of his character, through all his transitions. One tends to inwardly cringe at some of his self-revelations, thinking &quot;I would die before I revealed myself to the world with that level of unvarnished candor&quot; and indeed that&#39;s what most of us will do. It&#39;s so much easier to talk about others than oneself.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5293610827035743510'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5293610827035743510'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/10/gender-bender.html' title='Gender Bender'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3029773426021101943</id><published>2009-10-22T14:23:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-26T19:54:52.497-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Naked City</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/4028249439/&quot; title=&quot;Manikins by thekirbster, on Flickr&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2526/4028249439_5c05172d7c_m.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Manikins&quot; width=&quot;180&quot; height=&quot;240&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;before &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naked City&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3579256809/&quot;&gt;a local clothing store&lt;/a&gt; next to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Bagdad&lt;/span&gt;, is also adjacent to a space formerly occupied by &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;In Other Words&lt;/span&gt;, a feminist bookstore, since moved to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/08/education-planning.html&quot;&gt;a new location&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the window display features a male torso in a bloodied tux standing over a hacked up female per some Gothic horror movie motif (a Halloween theme) seemed radically insensitive to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/4035065489/&quot;&gt;Julia &amp;amp; Lindsey&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;br /&gt;
The core thesis is that the German policy of selling weapons to both sides in a conflict, so that feuding peoples would murder each other, has continued, thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-race.html&quot;&gt;racist thinking&lt;/a&gt; at the highest levels.  In the foreground:  disturbing, violent, horrific imagery, talking heads.&lt;br /&gt;

The audio track gives us more vintage Nixon.  The security council guy reminds us that Dick was a small town bigot surrounded by yes men (you have to kowtow to the president, if you wanna stay in the game, not say &quot;no&quot; like Gen. Ed Lansdale did when asked by JFK to murder Diem, provoking a hissy fit from Secretary McNamara  -- this isn&#39;t in the movie, &lt;a href=&quot;http://books.google.com/books?id=vQorBRYyu_gC&amp;amp;pg=PA245&amp;amp;lpg=PA245#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false&quot;&gt;A.J. Langguth&lt;/a&gt; is my source).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/killing-field.html&quot;&gt;Nixon&#39;s mindset&lt;/a&gt; was reflective of middle class America&#39;s mindset at the time, informed by Tarzan movies and what not.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Docile Americans, gullible to the core, tend to believe whatever their &quot;leaders&quot; tell them, says the movie.  Ergo Vietnam, Iraq, many other disasters.  Without a vigilant and educated people, you get a lot of bad ideas put into action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The film remains murky on many of the details, including some of its sources.  Why exactly was &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Lumumba&quot;&gt;Patrice Lumbaba&lt;/a&gt; killed again?  They scrounge up some CIA guy from twenty years ago, but he doesn&#39;t wanna talk about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding Liberia, we know Firestone wanted its rubber for cheap, so they could make those crummy tires for the Ford Explorers, but that&#39;s about all we know (I exaggerate -- we know plenty more).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Haile Selassie comes off as a principal anti-racist in the movie.  He goes down in history for this, per &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/field-trip-to-seattle.html&quot;&gt;the Lucy Exhibit&lt;/a&gt; as well.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2247737145051580691'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2247737145051580691'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/10/apocalypse-africa-movie-review.html' title='Apocalypse Africa (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhpwOo7I21JRWFpfMrhf18Ok1byE2oOUlU3n5XgZXsdLxXkuIqv6kTYSz6N_k_gmYLe-LAF35_pwu3TpeW_14GY4tWnDdSowCo4QuOnjhpVYL0PWwxLwQfUft-tihLSg6yuajKg/s72-c/apocalypse_africa.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-4536720936790183730</id><published>2009-10-14T17:43:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-16T13:30:55.814-07:00</updated><title type='text'>From Lyrik</title><content type='html'>I felt fortunate to get some face time with dear Nirel, part of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/12/voluntary-associations.html&quot;&gt;a voluntary association &lt;/a&gt;I&#39;ve branded as Coffee Shops Network (CSN).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She serves as CTO no less, consequent to her life-long dream (by this time) of carving out &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/franchise-motifs.html&quot;&gt;the salonstress role&lt;/a&gt;, in a next generation establishment reflective of her values and views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve worked in whole hearted support of that dream, given my strategy to pump healing philosophies out to a network, preferably in a mix with entertainment and even some level of game playing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nirel herself plays a great world game, with grace and integrity.

She wrote two obituaries for herself as an exercise, one in which she had a life of adventure, a shared voyage of self discovery, of self testing, and another in which she&#39;d clung to her drab existence, afraid to try for more than the narrow goals set by the twin ideologies of materialism and consumerism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The call of the wild eventually won her allegiance and she realized one morning, like a light going on, that rowing across the Atlantic might be her thing (she eventually did that, is next facing part three of her Pacific row, having completed two legs).  What gave her some inspiration was a married couple had tried, and whereas the big strapping guy had wigged out (intense agoraphobia and claustrophobia, a double whammy), the plucky misses had completed the row by herself. Roz saw herself as petite, not an athlete, not a superhero, not incredibly brave.  What she had was drive and a hunger to live her life fully.  She needed a project, one that wouldn&#39;t hurt the Earth, would on the contrary help with its healing (the Hopi were an inspiration here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve tended to see Roz as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mail-archive.com/edu-sig@python.org/msg04249.html&quot;&gt;the paradigm action figure&lt;/a&gt; in a series of storyboards involving energy accounting, a way to teach math where we convert joules and calories into work, measured in miles rowed, other output.  These simple physical equations about humans working were and are the focus of &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20110720094104/http://physics.unl.edu/~rpeg/First_Person_Physics/urneressay.html&quot;&gt;my &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;First Person Physics&lt;/span&gt; meme&lt;/a&gt;, what Dr. Bob Fuller picked up on and intelligently steered towards &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/04/more-first-person-physics.html&quot;&gt;the NSF&lt;/a&gt;.  We got a lot done, with Roz easy to point to as a source of inspiration.  Having listened to her stories tonight, I am as persuaded as ever that here&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2009-January/009030.html&quot;&gt;a great way to teach math&lt;/a&gt; in a way that will speak to many people.  Her Earth-friendly environmental message plants many good seeds. Lindsey Walker showed up in Portland from Savannah with &lt;a href=&quot;http://portland.freeskool.org/?q=node/1216&quot;&gt;a similar math-teaching paradigm&lt;/a&gt; around bicycle riding and towing (instead of rowing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was joined by one other Wanderer I recognized (Jay, likewise a fan), next ahead of me in line.  When she signed my copy of her book, I brought up the shared memory of our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/11/day-after.html&quot;&gt;Thanksgiving soiree&lt;/a&gt; two years ago.  She had just attempted her first leg of the Pacific back then, had capsized in a storm, was still recovering, including financially as the rescue of her craft had proved expensive.  Twas my privilege to join this appreciative audience in my own zip code area (97214), at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Powell&#39;s on Hawthorne&lt;/span&gt;.  Thank you Roz Savage.

She&#39;s out of town quite a bit, in cities I&#39;ve never seen except in movies or on TV.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve noticed diversity-sig starting to come on-line and signaled other PSF members to consider joining, although with open archives, you needn&#39;t join to lurk.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This new Python group came on radar after alpha and &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/09/equinox-retreat.html&quot;&gt;beta versions&lt;/a&gt; of a PSF diversity statement had already surfaced, following Guido&#39;s request that we have one.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;No, I&#39;ve not seen the new Michael Moore film yet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve been studying the MMM slate some more, some prompted by our need for a clerk &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wqm-day-one.html&quot;&gt;on QMP&lt;/a&gt; (looking to next year already) plus also wanting to sort out the liaison picture i.e. who&#39;s on first w/r to AFSC, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/08/report-from-fcnl.html&quot;&gt;FCNL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/london-knowledge-lab.html&quot;&gt;FWCC&lt;/a&gt; or whatever?  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve got the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/05/adult-education.html&quot;&gt;BCFM&lt;/a&gt; and NPYM positions with AFSC, but nothing going with MMM on that score.  Yes, an alphabet soup -- yet another namespace shared by Friends (RSoF).  If you poke around in these blogs or &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/catholic-analysis.html&quot;&gt;otherwise cross-reference&lt;/a&gt;, you&#39;ll find all these easy enough to decode.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/4875844826993065755'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/4875844826993065755'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/10/odds-n-ends.html' title='Odds &#39;n Ends'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-9036522124319515894</id><published>2009-10-03T17:51:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2023-02-02T22:55:35.231-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Econovergence</title><content type='html'>&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Given the title of this event, you&#39;d expect to find some economists in the line-up, and indeed we have a couple of those leading our teach-in, here on the third floor of First Unitarian Church. Mom is the next speaker in this room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The economist we just heard, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomaspalley.com/&quot;&gt;Tom Palley&lt;/a&gt; (EDOS), thinks the USG wasn&#39;t aggressive enough in the face of the implosion and that we&#39;ll be suffering some more shock waves. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/general-systems-theory.html&quot;&gt;a GST guy&lt;/a&gt; (general systems theory) I compete with some schools of thought, ally with others. &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/02/family-night.html&quot;&gt;The sun&lt;/a&gt; is what energizes the earth, not money -- let&#39;s at least be clear about that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other economist, Helen Scharber (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peri.umass.edu/&quot;&gt;PERI&lt;/a&gt;), persuaded us the renewable energy investments create more interesting work opportunities than just dumping funds into oil and gas. That seems likely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/stress-tests.html&quot;&gt;The Chinese system&lt;/a&gt; is helping to keep the USA&#39;s afloat. That probably means we should be listening to Chinese economists a lot more?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lindsey asked about what political climate would be required to motivate the kinds of policies our panel was advising. If there&#39;s another down turn, that&#39;s certainly not a guarantee of a more healthy political climate (on the contrary...). She also questioned the rather nationalistic analysis in terms of this or that government&#39;s policies -- spoken like a true &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html&quot;&gt;Global U student&lt;/a&gt; eh?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tag and I found each other at the Free Food exhibit, sponsored by Urban Gleaners, while &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3978114049/&quot;&gt;Lindsey tanked up&lt;/a&gt; on vegetables. Tag knows a lot of people here, given lots of overlap with PSU and the student / activist community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leslie Hickcox phoned me with her congratulations on &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wqm-day-one.html&quot;&gt;Day One of Quarterly&lt;/a&gt;, of which she managed to catch a part, in addition to making the Costco run more productive and enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Speaking of congratulations, Don Wardwell has &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/back-in-service.html&quot;&gt;his boat&lt;/a&gt; back in the water. He and Barry have been working hard on hull restoration. He phoned from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Island Cafe&lt;/span&gt; today, first time in awhile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom&#39;s WILPF group began with a Raging Grannies number. Then she took us down memory lane, reminding us of Portland&#39;s resistance to the Pentagon&#39;s pet civil defense program (bomb shelters, duck &amp;amp; cover, other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083590/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Atomic Cafe&lt;/span&gt; style&lt;/a&gt; nuclear madness). The article in question: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Portland -- the City that Chose Sanity instead of Fear&lt;/span&gt; by Carol Urner, Fellowship of Reconciliation magazine, January, 1965, page 11.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Portland is now remembered for being a small bubble of sanity in an intellectually lazy Lower48 (not that different from now in some ways). She also mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/11/practicing-with-friends.html&quot;&gt;Doug Strain&lt;/a&gt; and that Tektronix guy, and Senator Mark O. Hatfield (R), who helped keep Oregon from buying into &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/barak-obama-power-of-change-movie.html&quot;&gt;the military-industrial complex&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This workshop may touch on how some of that self-discipline may be slipping. There&#39;s the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://moneynews.newsmax.com/companies/daimler_trucks/2009/09/29/265993.html&quot;&gt;army trucks contract&lt;/a&gt; (Daimler), the drones by Boeing (&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/killing-field.html&quot;&gt;cowardly killer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insitu.com/index.cfm?navid=20&amp;amp;cid=3916&quot;&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt;?). No mention of &lt;a href=&quot;http://wweek.com/editorial/3315/8562/&quot;&gt;Evergreen&lt;/a&gt; though.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Barbara is going over the USG budget. 66.3% of the spending is towards mandatory items (vs. discretionary, the various entitlements and interest on the national debt).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The DoD budget runs around $533.7B, with $23.4B for DoE. $130B goes to discretionary occupations, sorry sad imperial crap, a lot of it highly questionable not to mention dishonorable. $9.66B for intelligence (so-called). Lots more numbers going by -- back to entitlements again (veterans, interest etc.).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We have brown envelopes to open with faux defense contracts enclosed. These states could&#39;ve had a lot more health care and education if not blowing money on ill-advised, loser escapades in Iraq and Afghanistan. We get to affix these contracts to maps of Oregon and Washington at the front of the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Someone just handed me a leaflet about the Ralph Nader talk tomorrow. Portland is certainly a happening place this weekend.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9036522124319515894'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9036522124319515894'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/10/econovergence.html' title='Econovergence'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5531249956504011728</id><published>2009-09-30T00:18:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-10-01T09:55:32.782-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Wanderers 2009.9.30</title><content type='html'>This was a Tuesday night open session.  We talked about what that means.  Given our one big table configuration, cross talk among private parties adds to the hubbub, challenging those with hearing aids especially.  My proposal was to keep giving the floor to show &amp;amp; tell artists who&#39;d guide the discussion, keeping cross talk (simultaneous conversations) to a minimum.  We also just need more hosted sessions (vs. open mic format).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When actually talking about topics, we had this stellar &lt;a href=&quot;http://interisland.net/johngilbrough/Space/&quot;&gt;polyhedra-in-stereo exhibit&lt;/a&gt; c/o Bill Sheppard.  I was initially ho hum saying I see this kind of stuff a lot, then figured out it was all in JavaScript, not Java, which perked my interest.  Lindsey felt vindicated at this point, as JavaScript, Perl and C had been her favorite three horses back in the good old days in Savannah.  The Java craze was at high crest back then maybe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays its &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/09/django-conference-day-1.html&quot;&gt;more JavaScript we admire&lt;/a&gt;, though as a system language, Java has a great deal to offer (it&#39;s maybe what people did with it that sucks, at least at the enterprise level sometimes).  The sweet spot Lindsey likes (we all have our tastes) is that C-Assembler interface with the low level device drivers.  Letting something loosey goosey like Python control real world objects, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/07/infrastructure-park.html&quot;&gt;like choo choo trains&lt;/a&gt;, sounds kinda perverse to her ears, and I understand that.  These Python extensions are written in C though, just export a control panel (API).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it was my turn to talk, I hooked the Ubuntu Starling to Don&#39;s Apple speakers and blasted &lt;a href=&quot;http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7841878207694220233#&quot;&gt;Tom Lehrer&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;New Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, writing the subtraction problem on the white board.  I had the longer (9 minute) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org/details/Ramanujan&quot;&gt;ballad about Ramanujan&lt;/a&gt; queued next, but the torch never came back around.  Anyway, I&#39;ve played it before, like on retreats &#39;n stuff, along with my fave &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/09/lampoon-harpoon.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;16 Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Billy Joel&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/09/wanderers-retreat.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;We Didn&#39;t Start the Fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/st-patricks-day-wanderers-retreat.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (anime) interlude scenes also top my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m still angling to book LW some time on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3947825595/&quot;&gt;the Jon Bunce upright&lt;/a&gt;, some discussion of music theory.  The classical pianist at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Muddy&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; sure had some good advice, such as &quot;lose the bracelets&quot;.  But then grand piano concert hall territory and punk bars just aren&#39;t the same deal.  One needs a range of costumes, matched to the venue in some way (perhaps to push the envelope, perhaps to camouflage ala our pet chameleon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also discussed some of the stories prominent in the news:  the typhoons in the Philippines; the tsunami in Samoa, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5353770n&amp;amp;tag=contentBody;housing&quot;&gt;various political stories&lt;/a&gt; (some chatter about the so-called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5347857n&amp;amp;tag=mg;eveningnews&quot;&gt;butt bomber&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was fresh from watching &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;CBS News&lt;/span&gt;, so relayed about Madeline Albright&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/25/couricandco/entry5340543.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody&quot;&gt;brooch collection&lt;/a&gt;, not unlike Admiral Crowe&#39;s hat collection in some ways.  I&#39;m sorry I missed her &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/diplomacy-r-us.html&quot;&gt;at &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bagdad&lt;/span&gt; that time&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5531249956504011728'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5531249956504011728'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/09/wanderers-2009930.html' title='Wanderers 2009.9.30'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1259456213697959202</id><published>2009-09-26T15:31:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2009-09-28T11:53:06.414-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Radical Women</title><content type='html'>I chauffeured LW to this meeting of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radicalwomen.org/&quot;&gt;Radical Women&lt;/a&gt;, mostly not planning to say anything, just eat (a potluck, she made fresh cabbage and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3957147885/&quot;&gt;corn bread&lt;/a&gt;), however I did sign on to the queue on invitation i.e. some of the leadership expressed curiosity about a possibly male viewpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke briefly about &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1989029&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;my diversity work&lt;/a&gt; with Python Software Foundation.  Most of the conferences in this subculture consist predominantly of men, yet those women managing to penetrate the clubhouse tend to hold leadership positions i.e. there&#39;s a meritocracy at the center that&#39;s mixed gender or even tilted towards women (thinking about computers more generally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter texted, hoping for more budget for her speech and debate costume.  So far, my offers to perform front lines teacher training duties have met a brick wall, while the chauffeuring pays but a pittance.  However, not wanting to be any of the characters in a Dickens novel, scroogey or otherwise, I trucked my ass down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/08/education-planning.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;In Other Words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and accessed my bank accounts over encrypted wifi, transferring a few dollars &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/04/boring-tax-story.html&quot;&gt;from DWA&lt;/a&gt; (the business) to Tara&#39;s charge card.  On the way, I stopped by at PCC, Cascadia Campus, and studied &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3957923736/&quot;&gt;its diversity literature&lt;/a&gt;, always on the lookout for examples, given &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/diversity-training.html&quot;&gt;the PSF work&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My working hypothesis is many of those in the free and open source software community haven&#39;t taken the time to become politically conscious.  They&#39;ve been too busy nerding out to really get a grip on these codes, notoriously crufty and difficult to operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given Portland is a relatively small town, it&#39;ll be interesting to discover what kind of overlap exists between political awareness groups such as Radical Women, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/06/os-bridge-conference.html&quot;&gt;FOSS bosses&lt;/a&gt; who also happen to be female, although I&#39;m also alert to cross-enrollment among men.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m keeping detailed lists or anything.  Nor was I intrusive with my camera, knowing better than to take a bunch of mug shots on a first visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hypothesis suffers a glaring weakness however in that free and open source software is all by itself a political movement.  FOSS ala GNU is all about engineers (mixed gender) retaining control over their work, not surrendering to lawyer controls.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/movie-sunday.html&quot;&gt;LAWCAP is crumbling&lt;/a&gt; as a result (hardly news), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html&quot;&gt;with GRUNCH&lt;/a&gt; on the rise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s rather esoteric shop talk however, which even most geeks haven&#39;t digested to any degree.  This doesn&#39;t stop us from forming strategic alliances however.  For example, given the highly socialized nature of the military, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/iron-mountain-revisted.html&quot;&gt;communal ownership&lt;/a&gt; of power tools, its not surprising that destructivists and constructivists have some common ground to build on, even if engaged in somewhat different styles of engineering.  Hence &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/kaa-meets-tiger.html&quot;&gt;Python + DARPA&lt;/a&gt; = &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/cp4e-versus-olpc.html&quot;&gt;CP4E&lt;/a&gt; was a sensible equation in one of our earlier chapters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we went around doing introductions, I mentioned my earlier work for AFSC as &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/06/prisoners-for-pelau.html&quot;&gt;a contributing editor&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Asian Pacific Issues News&lt;/span&gt; (APIN).

Dog poop left untended by the dog owner might as well be just pooping in public.  Take plastic bags, at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the journalism spin tends to fall by the wayside in some circles (namespaces), as in journalism you want that inside scoop.  &quot;Scoop of ice cream&quot; is still a good thing.  &quot;Two scoops please&quot;, is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/artifact.html&quot;&gt;very &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; kind of thing to say, very Norman Rockwell.

Another artist colony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From LindseyWalkerMusic:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A Portland family moved to Nebraska a little bit ago to chase employment. They got into a terrible bicycle accident there. The man’s face will need complete reconstructive surgery and may have brain damage but the severity and effects will not be known for a while. He also has thin blood and a heart problem which adds a serious risk of death to each surgical operation he has. The woman injured her knee. Their 3 yr old daughter was thankfully at home. She had just been laid off and he had just got a job that would support their family. He has no vacation or sick time. They need help covering rent while he’s recovering. So we’re throwing a benefit for them @ Circadia Art Center 4705 NE Columbia on Sept 11th 9pm.

It doesn&#39;t include pip yet, but that&#39;s coming.  He makes it look really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using easy_install, which goes against PyPI, he&#39;s grabbing pip.  This is typical for a virtual environment setup, where you want each tool to have the right path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched over to Terminal and started doing this stuff on Jennifer (Patrick&#39;s Ubuntu laptop).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked to &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/09/django-conference-day-1.html&quot;&gt;JKT&lt;/a&gt; after lunch, found him browsing Steve&#39;s binder at the PSF snake display.  He indeed plans a short talk based on Chaiman Steve&#39;s binder, with both the snake and pony totems a part of the gig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Wiles, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.revsys.com/talks/djangocon/2009/making-your-postgresql-database-sing/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Making your PostgreSQL database sing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increasing performance often means doing less, not doing more faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;postgresql.conf knobs:  set shared_buffers to 10-20% of RAM; effective_cache_size to 75% of available RAM; work_mem will give elbow room to ORDER BY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Materialized views, as distinct from normal views, put a snapshot of data on disk.  This works if your local data doesn&#39;t need frequent updates.  He showed pl/python triggered procedures to do real time updates on the fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panel Discussion:  selling your superiors on using Django.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PBS National uses Django extensively, e.g. the Earth Day site, PBS home page, PBS Teachers etc., are all Django sites or use Django components.  Producers and stations are also encouraged to use Django (American Experience, Newshour etc.).  NASA uses Django for internal file sharing and conference organizing.  NASA&#39;s SpaceBook is built on Pinax, Marshall uses it, Ames, Nebula uses Django as its core.  University of Texas is moving towards Python and Django to upgrade its faculty and student facing portal, replacing some homegrown 1995 solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why Django and not a PHP or Java based solution?  PBS was persuaded by OSCON, having dabbled in Zope / Plone.  They liked Python a lot.  Developers competed around an education pilot, with Django winning the prize (2006).  NASA also had Zope / Plone experience, had dabbled in Python, then saw Pimax.  Again, showing a working prototype to MVPs won the day.  University of Texas also had an evaluation process whereby Python first met the grade, then it was a choice between Pylons, Turbogears, Plone and Django.  The learning curve wasn&#39;t so steep, a plus when some new developers are coming in with little background or experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum:  rapid prototyping and the ability to move applications between projects is what&#39;s winning the day.  At NASA, the Django group is consistently performing well, in competition with .NET, PHP and Java developers.  Security concerns are important at University of Texas and Django tends to pass security audits fairly easily thanks to some of the plug-ins.  Having internal knowledge sharing meetings, as a part of a company&#39;s culture, helps cross-fertilize, gets people able to share ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of using open source, it&#39;s a good idea to bring your ideas into a company as already open source, versus trying to get company approval to open source something inhouse.  As a developer working with Django, it&#39;s easier to start your project in the commons, getting around control freaks who think they automatically own the hard work of other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company will likely benefit as open source means leveraging a global talent pool.  Other wisdom:  if your company offers a congenial environment but seems incapable of choosing the right tools for the job, then maybe that&#39;s not the right place for you, i.e. not every company is salvageable, even if it has lots of good people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.djangosites.org/&quot;&gt;Djangosites.org&lt;/a&gt; showing what enterprises use Django should be more front and center.  Python.org could use this advice as well.  Like NASA knew &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cmspowered.info/blog/cia&quot;&gt;the CIA was using Plone&lt;/a&gt; before most people did, which probably impressed some MVPs, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.olpcnews.com/people/negroponte/olpc_cia_conspiracy_theory.html&quot;&gt;soured others&lt;/a&gt;.  Like PBS wasn&#39;t so thrilled seeing its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.djangosites.org/s/www-pbs-org-teacherline/&quot;&gt;Django site for teachers&lt;/a&gt; right next to a Russian bikini-seller&#39;s on Djangosites.org (I couldn&#39;t find that -- yes, I searched).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Training is key.  More Django classes.  Holdenweb is a player.  Productivity, rapid results, is a key turn on.  Tuning in the community and the conversations creates a shared buzz.  Lore is a glue, keeps the work accessible, to non-techies as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightning Talks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alex Gaynor (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.twitter.com/alex_gaynor&quot;&gt;@alex_gaynor&lt;/a&gt;) on CPython bytecodes.
