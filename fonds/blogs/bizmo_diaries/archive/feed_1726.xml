Urner, Göteburg, July 2005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CBS News poked gentle fun at the North American market last night, wondering aloud if these freeway people would be smart enough to buy Smart Cars, long a feature of the European mindset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hummer and Ford Expedition were compared (both about 16 feet long) in silhouette, in stark contrast to this micro eight footer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, based on focus groups and market analysis, I think what North Americans now dream about are ways to rack mount the Smart Cars to pull them two or three at a time, behind the same gas guzzling global warmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each kid could have their own that way (more convenient for everyone!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To head off this trend, I suggest that RV park owners follow the Portland FlexCar model and stock smart cars (various models) at the camp sites. Or call it the Catalina Golf Cart model. &quot;No, ya don&#39;t have bring them all with ya, we&#39;ll just reserve some for ya, how&#39;s that?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize sharing resources, especially motorvehicles, is considered &quot;socialism&quot; by many North Americans. The freedom they fight for is the freedom to individually own, fail to maintain, then commend to the junk heap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And who am I to talk right? Like here&#39;s the BizmoBozo himself up on some high horse, raving and gesticulating about sociopathic gasoholic others. Like, don&#39;t I spend about as many joules as the average fuel-squandering American, when it comes to hauling my ass down the road?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115160941181260121'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115160941181260121'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/smart-cars.html' title='Smart Cars'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115136631793931811</id><published>2006-06-26T21:33:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:57.833-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Projected Wanderings</title><content type='html'>Alice was back from the midwest, where Vicky is also from, and was sharing stories about places visited.  I was jealous, having had precious little time to tour within the US, and hence my bizmo based fantasies, of making a living as a roaming gnu math teacher, ready to give schools a legup by cluing them in, giving them chanops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;South Dakota was mentioned, Iowa, Idaho.  Water parks were a theme.  I could see Tara having some fun, or me, like Homer Simpson, stuck in some tube, wondering if they&#39;d ever find me (I&#39;ll posit a happy ending on this one).  Mount Rushmore.  Lots of wide open vistas. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/SDWALdrug.html&quot;&gt;Wall Drug Store&lt;/a&gt;. Chief Crazy Horse (see the front page of today&#39;s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Oregonian&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stomped some bugs in my desert of code (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/why-foxpro.html&quot;&gt;FoxPro&lt;/a&gt;) this hot summer&#39;s day.  I dined again in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/on-job.html&quot;&gt;Fortress of Evil&lt;/a&gt; (that&#39;s like Klingon for &quot;great watering hole&quot;) on my lunch break, and savored the LL A/C.  I probably had too much Diet Pepsi though.  I should move to more juices... OK, now it&#39;s a Red Bull (yummy).  I also drink &quot;cow juice&quot; (milk, usually 1% organic, not ultra-pasturized), less often anything goat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve continued debating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1403158&quot;&gt;role of public education in US society&lt;/a&gt; @ Math Forum, arguing that it&#39;s a feeder circuit, used to recruit new talent into public service, even as it serves the needs of [some] private industries, small business, other participants in interstate commerce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To enroll in public school is to gain experience in operating the USA&#39;s democratic institutions from the inside.  Our state supported curricula are designed to run &quot;close to the kernel&quot; to help protect the future vitality and viability of our favored userland.  In laymans&#39; terms:  your public education system is here to serve you by giving you opportunities for success both in private enterprising &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; in serving the public (you needn&#39;t think either/or here).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On edu-sig, I&#39;ve been chatting about our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-June/006634.html&quot;&gt;hot weather&lt;/a&gt;, and my recent magazine reading, and also about the magic square and cube project, a focus of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/02/atlanta-in-march.html&quot;&gt;Martin Gardner&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;.  My proposed data structure for the recently discovered 5x5x5 one is probably &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-June/006631.html&quot;&gt;not the most appropriate&lt;/a&gt;.  A few lines of code could fix that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of hot weather, I just grabbed our Daewoo portable A/C from the garage and connected it up in Tara&#39;s room, so now we&#39;re contributing even more to the record megawattage pig-out we Portlanders are engaged in, as we soar through 102 degrees.  I wonder what a domed over village might save, if it went with central air.  Something for us gnu math heads to figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;24 hours later&lt;/span&gt;:  the Daewoo is dead.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115136631793931811'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115136631793931811'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/projected-wanderings.html' title='Projected Wanderings'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115091239874143085</id><published>2006-06-21T04:09:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:57.755-08:00</updated><title type='text'>More Adventures with TinkerBell</title><content type='html'>I like &quot;TinkerBell&quot; (the name of my bicycle) because it&#39;s in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase&quot;&gt;CamelCase&lt;/a&gt;, an allusion to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perl.com/lpt/a/2005/09/22/onion.html&quot;&gt;Republic of Perl&lt;/a&gt;, and by extension an homage to that sturdy if intractable beast of the Arabian experience. Add some discreet oasis cell towers, iPods and podcasting, and that lifestyle ain&#39;t so bad they tell me. Plus there&#39;s always the local airport, when it&#39;s time to get away from it all and see New York or whatever. A two way street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rode her (Tink) to Wanderers @ Linus Pauling House this morning, to join the free form discussion about reforming this and that (the PP in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.isepp.org/&quot;&gt;ISEPP&lt;/a&gt;). We just throw out policies, left and right, and then shoot &#39;em in a barrel, seeing which might survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some otherworldly suggestions, like I always do (mostly involving computers), and then wheeled in TinkerBell for a consult. We (as in &quot;the hive mind collective&quot;) got her working well enough to get me downtown at least, where I accessed the Extended Services Building @ PSU to sign &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/pay-day.html&quot;&gt;my contract&lt;/a&gt; (retroactively, for work already in the can).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also at Wanderers, on request from &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/st-patricks-day-wanderers-retreat.html&quot;&gt;Jon Bunce the musician&lt;/a&gt;, I did a &lt;a href=&quot;http://us.pycon.org/dc2005/talks/lightning&quot;&gt;Lightning Talk&lt;/a&gt; on gnu math, and dot notation in particular. How we think about numbers now, like of 1,2 and 3 as instances of a single class, say the Integer class, with operations like + and * being methods of that class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start out with a Dog class though, with just a constructor (__init__) and a self-representer (__repr__). I mostly write legal Python, abetting with diagrams. Had it been projected from my laptop, I could have executed the code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In about three minutes and as many pieces of butcher paper, I&#39;d inducted our small assembly into some deep mysteries of hackerdom. I&#39;d exposed the way we think (in OO -- not everyone uses this same model).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Wanderers (in this case all older adults) lapped it right up, i.e. got it immediately, and felt ready to play (Jim Buxton seemed especially ready). Music and software engineering go hand-in-hand I&#39;d hazard. Both involve looping, interpreting, clock cycles and so on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my work queue:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I&#39;m about ready to rewrite my embedded SQL programs to use SQLEXEC for &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/another-shop-talk.html&quot;&gt;pass through&lt;/a&gt; [later note from work site:  I&#39;m working on this now].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plus I keep getting North Korea on my plate, probably because I reviewed &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/team-america-world-police-movie-review_04.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Team America, World Police&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; awhile back, which spoofs Kim a lot (pun). Plus there&#39;s a lot of stuff in the news about some stupid rocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Closer to home, we&#39;re doing a major kitchen cleaning, with outside professional help. I helped supply the ice chests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plus I need to deal with those 02 tanks in a minute (the Apria truck is about to swing buy). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I recall &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/dan-rather.html&quot;&gt;Dan&lt;/a&gt; was in North Korea recently, &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/03/back-wired.html&quot;&gt;Tom Head&lt;/a&gt; reporting. Something about cats. A mystery. And how do the Moonies fit in? I am &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;so&lt;/span&gt; out of date apparently. Is this why we call it a Church of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sub&lt;/span&gt;genius? Fuller called it the Doppler Effect (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s05/p3100.html#534.00&quot;&gt;534.00&lt;/a&gt;) -- a lot about lagging or slack, a source of relativity in our respective narrative accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#39;t be up on everything at once. No Instant Universe. That&#39;s one of the teachings in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/span&gt;. Sometimes we learn it first in Arizona. Oregon may be ahead in the race to reform math education, but our &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-June/006616.html&quot;&gt;cartoon-making savvy&lt;/a&gt; lags that of many major studios, including in Japan.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115091239874143085'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115091239874143085'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/more-adventures-with-tinkerbell.html' title='More Adventures with TinkerBell'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115083928259571685</id><published>2006-06-20T14:22:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:57.659-08:00</updated><title type='text'>DMV</title><content type='html'>I showed up at the DMV, helmet in hand, all humble pie, owing to this lapse of my driving credential.  I felt it would be poor form to hot rod into the parking lot in Razz, and so dutifully mounted TinkerBell (newly named), which explains the bicycle helmet (also blue, but no bell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d already taken my #158 when I realized this meant a new picture, but I was disheveled, unkempt, not to mention untidy, and without a hair brush in my over-the-shoulder OSCON bag (very European, don&#39;t you think?).  I was wearing the orange &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/lucky-lab.html&quot;&gt;Lucky Lab&lt;/a&gt; T-shirt (the same one as &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/home-to-pdx.html&quot;&gt;through Heathrow&lt;/a&gt;, coming in), and joked to the DMV clerk that I was getting a dual purpose license that&#39;d also work for my dog.  He laughed dutifully, having an award for customer service (I saw it on the wall).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went in search of said brush, winding up, on foot, in some Asian hair salon, where the proprietess had some trouble deciphering my meaning, but then happily sold me said brush once she got clear: a handsome wooden one, very spikey, for $5.  I hustled back to the DMV in time for my appointment at the counter, where $34 took care of it.  Now I&#39;m back in the green, legal with the state, once again able to drive Razz with my head high (and yes, I can live with the new picture).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, as I said, this was all on a bicycle, the Seattle to Portland one, but now with a kid-friendly dinosaur bell (ring ring), plus other signs of aging.  I confirmed by cell that the longer loop&#39;d be fine, but then encountered &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.answers.com/sewerage&amp;amp;r=67&quot;&gt;sewerage repair&lt;/a&gt; happening (I&#39;m so out of date) and had to reroute.  Before that, however, I enjoyed the new pavement, waved hello to Precision Castparts Corp. (a local giant) and... well, then came the fence, and the detour up a steep hill to Crystal Springs, out by Tolman, onto Bybee and on into Westmoreland.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don, a native of those parts, by-phone recommended the Philly steak place, which also serves Moore Beer.  I was astonished by the smokey flavor of Copper, plus savored the IPA.  The sandwich was delicious.  Then I wandered by the Bunce residence, to discuss sheet music in cyberculture.  Then home, loop complete, but without the expected east side run up from Sellwood to OMSI.  In retrospect, the diversion was welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, TinkerBell and I did the Hawthorne to Steel, back along the east side esplanade (very Uru, and reminiscent of &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/03/chattanooga-tn.html&quot;&gt;Chattanooga&#39;s&lt;/a&gt;), both ways through Ladd&#39;s Addition.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115083928259571685'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115083928259571685'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/dmv.html' title='DMV'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115068471767818295</id><published>2006-06-18T19:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-06-15T14:44:34.444-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Roller Skating Event</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/DSCN1195.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/DSCN1195.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/DSCN1194.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/DSCN1194.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/DSCN1223.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/DSCN1223.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/DSCN1220.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/DSCN1220.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/DSCN1189.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/DSCN1189.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;My thanks to Elizabeth Braithwaite for the use of her camera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115068471767818295'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115068471767818295'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/roller-skating-event.html' title='Roller Skating Event'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115065658241352497</id><published>2006-06-18T11:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-02-11T22:38:16.852-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Why FoxPro?</title><content type='html'>Sometimes I enthuse about FoxPro and readers wonder why. Is it just the resonance with George Fox, our fearless leader (circa 1600s) of Friends?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually, for me, that &lt;span style=&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; part of its appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet FoxPro is strong in other respects, as a descendent of xBase for example, a language originating at CalTech&#39;s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), and spinning off into the commercial sector as Ashton- Tate&#39;s dBase II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FoxPro grew up as an implementor of the defacto xBase standard, and has this whole client side way of manipulating database records that&#39;s non-SQL, more procedural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a lot of products bundle some rather primitive programming language, often named PL, with their SQL, but FoxPro&#39;s solution is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Visual FoxPro is a complete GUI IDE, like Visual Studio, and comes with its own back end, even if you don&#39;t have an SQL engine like Oracle&#39;s handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I was an xBase programmer, mostly for Portland area nonprofit and government sector agencies, long before I got into Python. The original DOS-based FoxPro was gobbled up by Microsoft, which migrated it to the Windows platform as FoxPro for Windows (FPW).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came a more complete overhaul, as Microsoft blackboxed some of the more speed-critical objects such as Forms, and fleshed out a large dictionary of methods and attributes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#39;t lose our ability to write embedded SQL, plus gained new powers to send SQL dialect down the ODBC pipeline, getting back cursors developed server-side, and now returned to our VFP client for further processing, and perhaps GUI display within some grid object.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably my admiration for VFP over say Microsoft Access, is the underlying superiority of xBase for database work (for which it was specifically designed), over anything derived from BASIC, a hodge-podge to begin with.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115065658241352497'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115065658241352497'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/why-foxpro.html' title='Why FoxPro?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115058595951567204</id><published>2006-06-17T20:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2008-04-12T13:47:44.933-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Cars (movie review)</title><content type='html'>The plot (which shares elements with &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/over-hedge-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Over the Hedge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)  involves a self-assured, vain No. 1 who feels isolated and friendless, takes a detour in life, and discovers family and friends, including a possible No. 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#39;s always some initial destiny to fulfill, an heroic gesture for an appreciative other.  She gets it:  he&#39;s good hearted after all.  A good story, and sometimes a good movie.  In this case:  definitely a good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love sampling such pure Americana (Route 66 through nowhere), and consider this an homage to cartoons set amidst desert mesas and cactus, a backdrop for some of our favorite animated friends (meeb meep).  I appreciate this wide open desolation, find it in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sims 2&lt;/span&gt;, and in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098746/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Bagdad Cafe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The time-frozen village, bypassed by I-40, showcases some interesting hippie-vet dynamics around flag time in the morning.  Ferrari-worshipping Italians bow down before family icons.  And everyone&#39;s into neon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The love story was cool (Dawn loved the Porsche), and I appreciated the lesson in regional planning (how not to -- although in this case of Radiator Springs, it all came out for the best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky cars!  Their civilization took my mind off ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in my real world...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still futz with this crippled Windows computer, still unable to update itself and get cured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notice how a perfectly good machine world goes bad once those nasty humans show up.  I could see where the Ice Queen &#39;d be suspicious and cold, and attempt to slow their advance (their king is a four-legged, she&#39;s noticed -- and perhaps that&#39;s to their credit (she&#39;s got her dogs)).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like in &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/04/robots-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Robots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Car World is not competing with another intelligent observer species, except maybe that guy Frank, the combine -- easily stopped by fences, though he may get through in dreams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And speaking of competing intelligent life, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cars&lt;/span&gt; included a spoof outtake from &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/span&gt; didn&#39;t it, with the jets fighting spark plugs or something like that.  Or was that in a preview?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope to see &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Cars&lt;/span&gt; again someday, maybe on some Airbus with Dawn and Tara.

True, apocalyptic Christians are royal pains in the behind, but these global warming freaks are just as painful to listen to.  All that whining about God&#39;s will, gimme a break (joke).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The common denominator:  fear in both cases.

Having the hedgehogs inadvertently conjure that THX logo, with all the sound this entails (potentially waking the sim upstairs, clerk of a homeowners&#39; association), seemed an unusually brilliant stroke, and this film was full of such finishing touches.  The buildup to the manic stupid squirrel becoming hyper-manic (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/incredibles-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;an incredible&lt;/a&gt; and a hero) was exquisite (squirrel on steroids).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I liked this movie.

Many teachers want things to go very slooooowly, because their chief concern is to &quot;fill time&quot;. They have hundreds of hours to cover geometry, and it&#39;s still never enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Haim took me to task.  As etymologists well know, people often confuse Latin and Greek roots and the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;peda&lt;/span&gt; in pedant is really from the Greek &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;peda&lt;/span&gt; meaning child, the same &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;ped&lt;/span&gt; as in pedophile and relating to the Sanskrit for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;small&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggested these two peds might be related further back in time, in that pedestrian peasants were socioeconomically smaller than the equestrian bullies who towered over them.  Children, like serfs, don&#39;t have as many rights and are sometimes preyed upon by adults.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haim tore that argument to shreds, which &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-wars-continued.html&quot;&gt;Wayne&lt;/a&gt; thought was beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I was at least able to preserve the connection between &quot;pedantic&quot; and &quot;plodding.&quot;  I don&#39;t think many pedants will begrudge me that.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/114883283087650061'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/114883283087650061'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/battle-lost.html' title='A Battle Lost'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-114841463717219411</id><published>2006-05-23T13:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:56.703-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Family Time</title><content type='html'>Dawn had a front row seat on Haystack Rock at Cannon Beach, in the company of her dear cousin Pat and friend Lil.

Like when they film a movie:  stars need their &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/bizmos-in-baghdad.html&quot;&gt;bizmos&lt;/a&gt; or trailers, rock stars their buses.  Then you need lights, cameras, other equipment.  A director sometimes. There might even be tents involved, just like old times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &quot;reality TV&quot; mode, documenting the event for the archive and later editing is important, but is not the whole point (reality is &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; entirely &quot;made for TV&quot; much as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/&quot;&gt;some viewers&lt;/a&gt; might buy that it is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, we&#39;re getting other work done too, depending on the type of event:  a dome raising, a health care happening, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/03/python-for-gis-experts.html&quot;&gt;an educational presentation&lt;/a&gt;, juggling, magic tricks, any or all of the above -- or something completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/08/1931-bizmo.html&quot;&gt;a bizmo&lt;/a&gt; might indeed show up solo, some &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4711240&quot;&gt;master teacher&lt;/a&gt; aboard, probably scheduled long ahead of time, per some local (or remote) control room itinerary.  Or is the event unscheduled?  Like in some cartoon about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/04/practicum-bizmoticum.html&quot;&gt;Wild West&lt;/a&gt;, the stranger rides into town and ties up at the saloon...  Many plot lines diverge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m somewhat surprised that reality TV hounds haven&#39;t already explored this genre in more depth.  True, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ulmer&quot;&gt;Dave Ulmer&lt;/a&gt; is more into uploading &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/12/we-win.html&quot;&gt;stills&lt;/a&gt; than movies, from his satellite equipped rig in the desert.  Maybe he should take up juggling?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or we could have a multi-&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2005/08/4d-solutions.html&quot;&gt;decal&lt;/a&gt; jobber, including that &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/home-schooling.html&quot;&gt;new Python one&lt;/a&gt;.

On the whole, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387131/&quot;&gt;the movie&lt;/a&gt; brighter and less subtle, compared to a darker, more intricate printed work.  On the other hand, the film had its own semaphores and semiotic twists -- I&#39;m not trying to dismiss films as intrinsically inferior to books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the novel was effective in sucking me in to some character&#39;s inner life (the opening sequence), seducing me into a reality according to that viewpoint, and then abruptly changing viewpoints, and looking back from behind a different pair of eyes (his wife&#39;s).  I&#39;m talking about Sandy, not Justin, but when we move to him (and more or less stay there), once again, the outlook so drastically changes.  We get access to new secrets, and closer to the world of Friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film version adds a lot of good imagery, and if you want to go back to the original plot, borrowing these wonderfully rendered characters and scenery, that&#39;s an option.  Or, to put it another way, if you saw the movie first, and now wonder about reading the book, I&#39;d say &quot;go for it.&quot;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/114719341938799166'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/114719341938799166'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/constant-gardener-movie-review.html' title='Constant Gardener (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-114684804785146447</id><published>2006-05-05T09:49:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:43:56.237-08:00</updated><title type='text'>News Item</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;
