Some people think &quot;seclorum&quot; means &quot;secular&quot; as in &quot;new secular order&quot;, which is wrong.  &quot;Seclorum&quot; means &quot;of the ages&quot; or thereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A theologian might say &quot;that&#39;s what I &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;meant&lt;/span&gt;:  temporal, i.e. fallen from God&#39;s grace&quot; presuming God has a hate feeling for Time or vice versa.  But in my judgment that&#39;s wrong too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see it more as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/more-wanderings.html&quot;&gt;Tower of Babel&lt;/a&gt; relationship:  as you get higher in your Pyramid, you get greater overview, sure, but you&#39;re also more alone in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/09/lampoon-harpoon.html&quot;&gt;your angle&lt;/a&gt; on things.  As we Quakers say, communing with God is not about getting everyone else to think the way you do.  You individualize or individuate as the Jungians put it.  Don&#39;t expect to sound just like everyone else when you do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my translation of &quot;secular&quot; is more like &quot;friendly to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;individuals&lt;/span&gt;&quot; which might mean &quot;characters&quot; i.e. these one-of-a-kind, unique specimens.  By definition, we&#39;re not all on the same page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that hatred of &quot;different&quot; is refreshingly absent, and that&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at.  The Great Seal is a promise, of acceptance, of many religions, many creeds and philosophies, many ethnicities.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/us-versus-john-lennon-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Statue of Liberty&lt;/a&gt; is in keeping with this message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You the Individual have this special privilege of ascending this Pyramid to achieve greater overview.  We enshrine that viewpoint as a Presidency, in our temporal model of intelligent government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#39;s really each of us with this power to internalize a &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-re-public-education.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;virtual president&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as long as we don&#39;t expect to become tyrants at the top (as if that&#39;d make any sense to anyone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/4179/1271/1600/great-seal.0.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger2/4179/1271/200/great-seal.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;:: the great seal ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6242598332273346486'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6242598332273346486'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/about-secularism.html' title='About Secularism'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116357673310858887</id><published>2006-11-14T23:43:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:07.691-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Synergeo 30549</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/L11383.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/L11383.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;L11383.wrl by Jim Lehman&lt;br /&gt;viewed with Cortona VRML viewer by Parallel Graphics&lt;br /&gt;in Mozilla FireFox on Windows XP&lt;br /&gt;(click for larger view)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116357673310858887'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116357673310858887'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/synergeo-30549.html' title='Synergeo 30549'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116344996328437402</id><published>2006-11-13T12:25:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:07.595-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Borat (movie review)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Borat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is something like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045376/&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Candid Camera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066626/&quot;&gt;All in the Family&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;on steroids, with bigotry, other shocking attitudes and behaviors, on parade at every turn, amidst a lot of inspired clowning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question is:  how candid &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; this camera, which can&#39;t be hidden, given the angles, but still pretends it isn&#39;t there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film pokes fun at this news reel and documentary motif, by making Borat&#39;s traveling companion a camera shy TV producer.  When the two have a falling out and the producer absconds with the bear (a long story), Borat is &quot;all alone&quot; (but how can that be?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The camera is strongly an omniobjective third person, and yet Borat talks to it, confides to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The candidness of those playing themselves in this film is what makes it so comical, so if &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;The Making of Borat&lt;/span&gt; on the DVD discloses lots or rehearsing and/or retakes, that&#39;ll detract from the sense of spontaneity and improv, by turning &quot;real people&quot; into comic actors (like Borat himself, a top ranking professional clown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our sense of it, in the audience, is that the Borat plus cameraman combo, with lurking producer, must come across as believable to these North Americans, who see themselves as if on TV anyway, from having watched it so much.  So their unselfconscious on-camera behavior &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;does&lt;/span&gt; come across as completely candid, especially on that TV studio set, where the talent is quite used to living on screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In disrupting the weather report, Borat exposes the invisible rules by breaking them.  The weather guy finds this irrepressibly funny, in keeping with the overall tone and technique of this film.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116344996328437402'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116344996328437402'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/borat-movie-review.html' title='Borat (movie review)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116319710372013397</id><published>2006-11-10T14:15:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:07.503-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Back to the Silicon Forest</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/budshouse.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/budshouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;:: bud&#39;s house ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I&#39;m high tailing it back to the stormy Pacific Northwest, having chauffered family to/from Bud&#39;s southeast of Orlando, leaving Dawn, Tara and Alexia to enjoy a couple more days of fun in the sun.

S&#39;OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bud, aka Arthur Dix, contracted polio while in the military, made captain in the Civil Air Patrol in the 1940s, then made a career with Eastern Airlines in operations. Bud married Dawn&#39;s mom Glenys after she divorced Don and moved with her kids, Dawn and Sam, to Satellite Beach. Carla, the youngest, stayed with her dad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They started building a new house together, which was left partially unfinished after Glenys died unexpectedly from what should have been a routine hospital procedure. Yesterday was the 20th anniversary of her death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bud has two loving daughters by a previous marriage who live nearby and help him with the complications of old age. We all gathered for take out pizza last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thanks to Continental Airlines, Alamo, UPS and Providence Home Services for helping to make this trip possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/impala.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/200/impala.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;font-size:85%;&quot; &gt;:: impala ::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116319710372013397'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116319710372013397'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/back-to-silicon-forest.html' title='Back to the Silicon Forest'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116294361877758583</id><published>2006-11-07T15:35:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:07.415-08:00</updated><title type='text'>More Election Day News</title><content type='html'>Bad news was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/nation/4314841.html&quot;&gt;blaze in Orlando&lt;/a&gt;, killing two pythons and a gator.

Based on recent government reports, I&#39;m thinking that&#39;s actually a likely prospect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that&#39;s not imaginative enough. We could have public system alternatives that are radically different from the norm, to make diversity even more real. For example, what gets taught in the vicinity of tribal sovereignties aka Indian Reservations? Why shouldn&#39;t that content be altered to include optional flatscreen based math from Python Nation? That&#39;d be a new choice for deserving, patient Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus other public schools could subscribe as well (given we&#39;re talking cyber-assets a lot of the time, meaning duplication costs are quasi zero, and Uncle Sam likes being thrifty when the economy allows it -- this appeals to fiscal conservatives especially).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;d prefer to see radical diversity &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;within&lt;/span&gt; the public system, offered to satisfy the legitimate demand for choice, than see taxes leaking away willy-nilly, to private schools which might not have the same level of commitment to keeping the USA active and healthy over the long haul. When citizens pay taxes, it&#39;s to make our nation great, not to aid and abet raiders and looters of its treasures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;font-size:85%;&quot; &gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=5320459&amp;amp;tstart=0&quot;&gt;Originally published&lt;/a&gt; to the Math Forum.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116210192977021340'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116210192977021340'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/in-favor-of-school-choice.html' title='In Favor of School Choice'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116200553322216908</id><published>2006-10-27T19:46:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:06.900-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Random Thoughts</title><content type='html'>Yes, today&#39;s high frame rate video games -- a different challenge than rendering (used in hidef cartoons) -- if T-rated, may well contain violence far above what I recall CBS decrying back in the early days of rasterized V-games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if meant to stay a cartoon, wrapped in a sports ethic, forbidding of animal cruelty, then we keep the psychological elements we associate with pro ball, other high stakes sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We like and willingly pay for this drama, and tolerate the trade off between risk and sports injury to our egos.

It was all &quot;math in the rear view mirror&quot; with a promise (often hollow) of major revelations just around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;No &#39;higher math&#39; until you can &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;do it yourself&lt;/span&gt; -- and that&#39;ll take years and years&quot; was the silly premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine if we taught English that way. It&#39;d be laughable, a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet that&#39;s exactly how they taught it, for the most part -- minus any really appreciative or interpretive gloss on stuff too advanced to just sit down and do, but otherwise quite accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#39;t have to be a circus performer to appreciate a good circus. You don&#39;t have to be a calculus whiz to get hip to a lot of what the calculus is all about, maybe starting with the ancient Greeks, not just Newton and Leibniz (the more parochial approach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The traditionalists were just as bad. You had to follow in lockstep, with no fractals until you could &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; them -- and since computers were verbotten in traditionalist classrooms, that meant like never (doing fractals by hand was just a joyless waste of time, believe you me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another consequence of this latent vocationalism was students were only allowed to &quot;solve problems.&quot; They were almost never invited to &quot;just do something interesting&quot; with their growing set of tools. Yet just playing with polyhedra &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; a way to exercise one&#39;s vector arithmetic abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Problem, what problem? We do math just for the hard fun of it.&quot; This attitude was practically unheard of back then. They preferred to keep you inundated with busy work, pseudo problems -- less fun than even puzzles or games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The constructivists were a little better here, but still, very little appreciation for art or architecture, and the role of geometry through the ages, was manifest in their curricula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History was suppressed, art was suppressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was all about &quot;weed and feed&quot; i.e. kill off all but the die-hards, who&#39;ll be your next generation of hair-shirt killjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make them be problem-solver good doobies, never the more explorational question authority types, such as we breed in the humanities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Math teachers worked for slave ship owners, not for freedom-loving krews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it&#39;s a good thing that&#39;s all so over and done with, at least in some of our better flagship USA schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;font-size:85%;&quot; &gt;Copyleft by Kirby Urner, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/&quot;&gt;Oregon Curriculum Network&lt;/a&gt;, feel free to republish with attribution, edit only to fix typos.&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116183333030643075'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116183333030643075'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/just-for-hard-fun-of-it.html' title='Just for the Hard Fun of It'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116152519612404722</id><published>2006-10-22T06:50:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:06.733-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Playing with Blocks</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/tmods.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/tmods.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;font-size:85%;&quot; &gt;David Koski&#39;s dissection of a cube&lt;br /&gt;into phi-scaled T-mods + remainder tets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/10/vip-visits-pkl.html&quot;&gt;David&lt;/a&gt; brought some cardboard models along for the Portland Knowledge Lab to play with, including his dissection of the cube into blue, yellow and green T-mods, plus a few remainder tets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scale any T-mod&#39;s edges by phi (about 1.618) to get the next larger size, or by 1/phi (about .618) to get the next smaller size.

He brought a ton of books to the venue and piled them in a pyramid on the table in front of him.  Terry is running a camera.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basic SG includes using the Egyptians&#39; golden vessels to diagram earth, water, air and fire, within their universal container, a pentagonal dodecahedron (not quite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/synergetics.html&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Synergetics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but that&#39;s for &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/10/sacred-geometry-talk.html&quot;&gt;my talk&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By showing us all of these books, many by respectable authors (including an upcoming ISEPP speaker), he&#39;s helping us realize that this sacred geometry stuff is not too weird, not too scary.  A lot of the basic math is actually very familiar and elementary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have forever mixed geometry with psychology (we do the same), brewing up whatever flavors of rationality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a good mix, and you&#39;ve got the ingredients for a flourishing civilization, weather permitting.

Later, I made some snide and sarcastic remarks about &quot;sitting duck&quot; aircraft carriers like the USS Eisenhower, rumoredly preparing for battle in some dimension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per these sitting ducks, you have to read &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Critical Path&lt;/span&gt; to understand how we Fuller Schoolers identify them with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html&quot;&gt;moronic element&lt;/a&gt; that makes bad policies worse out of greed and its consequents, &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/catholic-economy.html&quot;&gt;guilt &amp;amp; fear&lt;/a&gt; e.g. we can&#39;t &quot;cut and run&quot; because some of these &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/rebuilding-iraq.html&quot;&gt;outraged civilians&lt;/a&gt; are justifiably angry at being murdered for their oil, and might take their beef to our highest courts and win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More power to &#39;em.  That&#39;d be democracy in action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#39;m brainstorming a movie wherein we expend unneeded cruise missiles against no-longer-relevant aircraft carriers.  Why use mockups and CGI and you have a lot of spare hardware just sitting around doing nothing useful?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry&#39;s talk is getting a lot better.  He&#39;s bascially using Chaos Theory to help the more retarded among the Physicists understand why their &quot;fundamentalism&quot; (aka reductionism) isn&#39;t philosophically all that interesting or alluring to big money investors any more.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116067906527550671'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116067906527550671'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/wanderers-20061011.html' title='Wanderers 2006.10.11'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116051884646963438</id><published>2006-10-10T15:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:06.200-08:00</updated><title type='text'>NY Sojourn</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/empirestate.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/empirestate.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/washingtonpark.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/washingtonpark.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/statueofliberty.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/statueofliberty.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/bodies.3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/bodies.3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/kirbydavid.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/kirbydavid.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/powerstation.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/powerstation.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/flagsofourfathers.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/flagsofourfathers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116051884646963438'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116051884646963438'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/ny-sojourn.html' title='NY Sojourn'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-116026157402109994</id><published>2006-10-07T15:52:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:06.117-08:00</updated><title type='text'>WQM @ Mt.

But Amish, modeling on Jesus, have already worked through to forgiveness, thinking very much of the man&#39;s family and children (also innocent casualties in this melee).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if this insecurity dad had been Yemeni and the school on a US military base?  How quickly would the love have spread in that context?  But Amish are more expendable right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yemen is an easy target after all, quasi-defenseless, unlike these truck-driving insecurity dads, who pretty much &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;run&lt;/span&gt; the Pentagon, at least in their own minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, there&#39;s a lot of energy to be had from righteous wrath (that I&#39;ll own up to), though when stupidly expressed and squandered, that energy drains away pretty quickly, perhaps taking one to a low ebb at an inconvenient time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vengeful anger is a high risk investment, best &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;grounded&lt;/span&gt; and thereby &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;dissipated&lt;/span&gt; in polemics and debate (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dixie Chix&lt;/span&gt; a good model, film and television among the worthy media).  &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do&lt;/span&gt; express yourself sufficiently effectively to distribute the load far and wide to empathetic others. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t&lt;/span&gt; bottle it and sell it as self-amplifying hate literature to your self-chosen inner circle, trying to enflame them into committing atrocities, suicidal or otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, I myself have invested in stridently &lt;a href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/29651&quot;&gt;unforgiving polemics&lt;/a&gt; from time to time.  I let those speeches stand, as reflective of my state, and likewise pray &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/quakes.html&quot;&gt;Bob&#39;ll&lt;/a&gt; cut me some slack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not one to go back and censor the historical record too much, although I do assert my control over personal content (I&#39;ll rewire links, add or drop web pages -- you can check archive.org for what my stuff &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;used&lt;/span&gt; to look like).  Plus a lot of stuff &lt;a href=&quot;http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/pointful-gossip.html&quot;&gt;just breaks&lt;/a&gt; (entropy is ongoing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the way Bucky did it:  small staff, no paid publicist, directly handled the mail.  Nowadays, with the Internet, I have further freedoms:  world readable publishing, mail washers and spam filters -- plus a lot of the same affiliates Bucky had (even if I&#39;ve managed to alienate a few).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course my Global Data Corporation sounds awfully big, not easily controlled.  But like &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/hp4e.html&quot;&gt;HP4E&lt;/a&gt;, it&#39;s mostly into open source business modeling, meaning we advertise our &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;ideas&lt;/span&gt;, educating the public about ecosystem sciences and synergetics (e.g. my &lt;a href=&quot;http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/05/tv-commercial.html&quot;&gt;T-mods commercial&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the literature, Global Data is a lot like the Economists&#39; XYZ Corporation: a generic paradigm widget maker used to advertise the concepts of economists, quasi-fictional yet doing real work in the real world, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; a template, usually spun as behaving innocently, if awkwardly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Global Data is correspondingly &lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/02/news-and-views.html&quot;&gt;into screen widgets&lt;/a&gt; for World Game players, other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst1.html&quot;&gt;relevant eye candy&lt;/a&gt;, and advertises general systems theory (GST), in competition with the economists&#39; less scientifically informed self-discipline.  We have many enlightened sponsors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Esoteric bumper stickers: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Global Data:  an IVM Corporation (XYZers welcome to apply).&lt;br /&gt;Global Data:  more mirrors, less smoke.&lt;br /&gt;Global Data:  Better&#39;n Enron&#39;s Bull.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116006775497458944'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/116006775497458944'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/forgiveness.html' title='Forgiveness'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115997960883251309</id><published>2006-10-04T11:58:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:05.959-08:00</updated><title type='text'>News Article (satire)</title><content type='html'>In a newly leaked memo obtained by this news agency, we&#39;ve learned of a conspiracy of silence around keeping young children from understanding spatial geometry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If they&#39;re that smart, that young, we&#39;ll never be able to control them later&quot; one official is quoted as saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, this conspiracy stretches over several decades.  The memo is on Department of Education letterhead, although it is unsigned and we&#39;re assured untracable to any particular cubicle within the building.  However, forensic analysis reveals it&#39;s been in circulation since approximately the mid 1970s [editor&#39;s note:  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ed.gov/index.jhtml&quot;&gt;Ed.gov&lt;/a&gt; isn&#39;t that old, please factcheck].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agreeing to speak off the record, an additional source in the White House provided further details about just what is being suppressed.  &quot;There&#39;s this really easy way to teach the kind of thing the Greeks were into, like polyhedrons &#39;n stuff, which in the current political climate are deemed just too subversive for impressionable young minds to be exposed to.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Some even speculate over exposure to polyhedra can make you gay&quot; he continued, &quot;and how much is too much? -- better to err on the side of caution.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This &quot;really easy way&quot; another source revealed, involves dividing a regular tetrahedron (a kind of three sided pyramid with a triangular base) into various other proportional shapes with similarly greek names, and organizing everything &quot;concentrically&quot; (mathematical jargon for &quot;around the same center&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our news agency is so far unable to obtain any pictures of the geometry in question, which are apparently still deeply classified.  Until further details are learned, this obscure conspiracy may continue for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#39;s just no easy way to decipher just what these anonymous officials are really talking about.  We&#39;d really need to see something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wait, this just in:  an anonymous fax from North Korea.  The picture is somewhat blurry, given that nation&#39;s backwardly Stalinist phone system, but for what it&#39;s worth, here it is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/plate09.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/320/plate09.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115997960883251309'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115997960883251309'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/news-article-satire.html' title='News Article (satire)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-115982607660856486</id><published>2006-10-02T16:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-15T11:44:05.872-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Terminal (movie review)</title><content type='html'>A retarded guy handicapped by a war torn special case language, is in an unacceptable state, and so gets frozen into a holding pattern within &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227/&quot;&gt;the isotropic vector matrix&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of generalized principles, here projected as blue meanie enforcers, mostly male-hierarchical, and quasi-omniscient (lots of security cameras).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our hero&#39;s freedoms are strictly limited.  However, by working at various language games, including the solution of love triangles, he ascends in rank and worthiness, becoming more of an American icon.  His war torn state is healed and the icey totalitarianism of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/ivm.html&quot;&gt;the IVM&lt;/a&gt; gives way to an incommensurably free expression of personal individuality (symbolized by the jazz-playing saxophone).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having fulfilled his destiny, our hero returns to his home country (somewhere close to Borat&#39;s no doubt), leaving behind the austere, unforgiving integrity of this alien Vulcan world and its intertwined male/female energies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Planters and Ramada Inn brands get the most focus, with Sbarro a distant third.

He has that wound up with religion, and how &quot;all twelve&quot; (?) can&#39;t be simultaneously true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today at the Bagdad, Trevor was talking about this artist who planted live crabs with Barbie Doll ™ parts strapped on, in a place where kids lined up and asked for stuff from Santa. The point was to subvert the department store&#39;s moneymaking, &quot;asking Santa&quot; being management&#39;s clever gimmick for getting customers in the right mood for shopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was considered a disruptive maneuver, even for an artist, but one bystander said &quot;I&#39;m &lt;em&gt;glad&lt;/em&gt; someone is finally doing this.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#39;s the spectacle of &lt;em&gt;luring&lt;/em&gt; we don&#39;t like (ensnaring, baiting and switching). But the truth about Santa Claus isn&#39;t supposed to be disappointing, even when we deliver the punch line, that mom and dad love you, as do your friends and relations, and they express their love through this multi-faceted story, which says more about their love than mere physical things under a dead or dying tree could really get across.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/more-wanderings.html&quot;&gt;Telling stories&lt;/a&gt; is not in and of itself criminal, but the life blood of a culture. This is why we hate seeing children lied to, by this target of Fuller&#39;s Obnoxico meme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, I understand this guy&#39;s integrity, about Santa not being real and all that. But the rejoinder is &quot;&lt;em&gt;reality&lt;/em&gt; isn&#39;t the whole story around here, and never has been.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#39;s so &quot;anti-science&quot; about this attitude? Science is for compentently managing the reality part, and we take that very seriously, don&#39;t believe in being stupid about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; awake and alert scientists, want to &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; them ourselves, doing intelligent (and we hope mostly safe) experiments that teach us important and valuable lessons.  Endlessly repeating the same mistakes is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what we signed up for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let there be no doubt where &lt;em&gt;I&#39;m&lt;/em&gt; coming from at least: I think &lt;em&gt;empiricism&lt;/em&gt; is a &lt;em&gt;valuable ism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t follow that religion needs to get in the way of this pro-sciences agenda. On the contrary, many a religion is augmented with a set of sciences and vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our mythical awareness doesn&#39;t have to go to war with the literal truth if it doesn&#39;t want to, i.e. the operator in U = Meta*Physical (a Fuller School teaching) is meant to be both/and inclusive, not the sign of an internal contradiction.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115923715019615557'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/115923715019615557'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-about-santa-claus.html' title='More About Santa Claus'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
