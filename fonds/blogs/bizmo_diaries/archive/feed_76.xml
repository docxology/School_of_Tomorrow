This is one way I pursue (and sometimes attain) a level of happiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I&#39;m assured by reasonable math-oriented folks that it&#39;s perfectly meaningless that the following ratios hold true:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;S Factor&lt;/b&gt;: S : E :: CO(D) : Icosa(D)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;S3&lt;/b&gt;: SuperRT : CO(D) :: Cube(R) : Tetra(D)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;First: what does it all mean? and second: who cares?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;S and E are two of the Synergetics BEAST modules, irregular tetrahedrons defined in terms of the concentric hierarchy (CH).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The CH is the geometric centerpiece of Synergetics, R. Buckminster Fuller&#39;s transcendentalist geometry (i.e. philosophy).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The S modules, 12 left and 12 right handed, brick in the difference twixt an Icosahedron of edges S Factor (about 1.08), and its faces-flush nest, an Octahedron of edges D (2R) and volume 4.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here&#39;s a poster showing an S mod &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.casey-house.com/syn-u&quot;&gt;from Syn-U&lt;/a&gt; by Casey House:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The phi cut is along an edge of 2R (D). The IcosaWithin -- as David Koski and I call it -- with eight faces flush to those of the Octahedron, has edges S Factor, and a volume of about 2.92.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt; $$S Factor = 2\sqrt{7 - 3\sqrt{5}}$$ (&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/01/testing-math-ml.html&quot;&gt;using MathJax&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;All volumes are in tetravolumes i.e. the volume of the D-edged tetrahedron is our unit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;D is for diameter, R is for radius (1/2 the diameter). Icosa(D) is an icosahedron with edges D or 2R. Its volume is about 18.51.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cube(R)/Tetra(D) is known as S3, or &quot;Synergetics Constant&quot;, and it relates the respective unit volumes within the XYZ and IVM contexts (namespaces) respectively. In the XYZ context, we take the R-edged cube for a unit, whereas in the IVM context, a corresponding unit of volume is a D-edged tetrahedron, a little less. S3 is about 1.06066.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The SuperRT is a Rhombic Triacontahedron, a triac, with long face diagonals equal to the edges of Icosa(D). Its short diagonals form a pentagonal dodecahedron (PD). The two combined give the SuperRT, which is phi-up from the RT of 120 E modules. S:E is our S Factor.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The SuperRT : CO(D) ratio is the same as the Cube(R) : Tetra(D) ratio.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Who cares?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirsters ended a chapter in its long and winding way yesterday, with a final announced meetup at the E Broadway McMenamins. The group got started in a different McMenamins across the river, when &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/01/thirsters-gather.html&quot;&gt;Bob Textor and his friends&lt;/a&gt; would get together and yak it up, about world affairs, about politics, about trending topics and the talk about town.&lt;/p&gt;Our emails would usually come with the following verbiage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Thirsters:  Originally organized by Robert B. Textor (Professor Emeritus of Anthropology, Stanford) as a worldwide network in about 1997, Thirsters is an informal gathering of Peace Corps graduates, academics, public servants, business leaders, and other questioning individuals who discuss issues of peace, freedom, creativity, development, ethics, fairness, sustainability and respect for cultural differences.  Most often examining topics through a social science lens, Thirster meetings have been described as &quot;a learned salon that comes together for camaraderie, beer, and to discuss issues of common interest.&quot;    &quot;Intercultural understanding&quot; has often been identified as a primary concern of Thirsters. &lt;/blockquote&gt;I&#39;ve been phasing all alcoholic drinks out of my intake, starting with beer a couple years ago. I&#39;m assured by the example of others that I won&#39;t be disqualified from joining Thirsters in its &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/01/thirsters-debate.html&quot;&gt;next chapter&lt;/a&gt;, simply on that basis. We&#39;re switching to a private home to reboot and continue talking.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/wanderers-20091013.html&quot;&gt;We reminisced&lt;/a&gt; about some of the high points in our gatherings. I&#39;ve been attending Thirsters meetings for a long time and could match my memories to much of what was said. Several of us mentioned that Pashtun Khan guy who helped educate us about Afghanistan, a meetup &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/11/a-khan-at-thirsters.html&quot;&gt;I blogged about&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/4128222957006059574'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/4128222957006059574'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/02/thirsters-concludes.html' title='Thirsters Concludes'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-6770076176572895004</id><published>2024-01-27T16:08:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-27T16:10:09.172-08:00</updated><title type='text'>BizMo Fleet Personnel</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;As some of you know, I&#39;ve been advocating for socialized ownership of my bizmo fleet, meaning it&#39;s more like a Hertz or Avis: the individual crew checks a van out of inventory, but doesn&#39;t necessarily have the title or responsibility for maintenance. There&#39;s a control room in the background, a dispatcher. The template is well established, even in capitalist societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I&#39;d say Derek and Mazur are the furthest along in my network, when it comes to living the bizmo lifestyle. Both are familiar with the Honda Odyssey as a template. Derek is educating himself about generators, solar panels and such. Today we talked about a solar-wind village of about fifteen yurts (semi-permanent) where the bizmos could plug in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, my network is relatively tiny, and if one ventures into Nomad Land, either virtually or for real, the ideas worthy of copying come flooding in. Companies are working on more integrated solutions all the time. The van itself might be an EV. Opportunities for experimentation are endless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Oregon host a Makersville where all these puzzle pieces come together? Am I talking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/07/epcot-west.html&quot;&gt;EPCOT West&lt;/a&gt; again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might think the community colleges and universities would already be pretty far along in making Nomad Life a degree based program. However there&#39;s a lot of inertia and propaganda steering students away from anything other than a suburban home in a bedroom community with a commute to some city job in an office tower.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The corporate nanny state is trying to clone the past, given it depends on AI to discern the future. Clearly AI is not up to the task and our higher education systems flounder.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6770076176572895004'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6770076176572895004'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/01/bizmo-fleet-personnel.html' title='BizMo Fleet Personnel'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2326081346184987178</id><published>2024-01-25T08:05:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2024-02-02T06:41:08.874-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Thirsters Debate</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Thirsters are meeting tonight, for a final moderated debate in the current format, after which we&#39;ll have a celebratory &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/02/thirsters-concludes.html&quot;&gt;page turning event&lt;/a&gt;, a new format having been selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll be one of many on the call. As we started to find out last week, my camp is in favor of giving the Legal Eagles their chance at bat, and if they&#39;re able to win against the Trump organization so be it.&amp;nbsp; The powdered wig subculture cannot afford to be overruled by some angry mob that threatens violence if not given the &quot;right to vote&quot; for its figurehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, I&#39;m not seeing this camp in partisan terms, if by &quot;partisan&quot; we mean taking sides in the duopoly, and thinking this is Biden versus his political opponent. No, this is a Constitutional design pressure test, where a 3rd branch (the Judiciary) is challenging the Executive, Congress (the Legislative branch) having passed the buck on impeachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To review what happened: &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/january-sixth.html&quot;&gt;the January 6, 2021 riot&lt;/a&gt; led to a second impeachment hearing regarding the US president&#39;s fitness to continue in office, but by then he was already on the way out, so what would be the point of kicking him out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I take this view in part because &quot;new circuit designs for Motherboard Earth&quot; includes more thinking about &lt;a href=&quot;https://grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html&quot;&gt;USA OS&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. seeing the government as an operating system and thinking more in those terms. Dividing government into these three branches -- judiciary, executive, legislative -- was very forward thinking on the part of these design science revolutionaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the judiciary is so weak that it&#39;ll cave to threats about Civil War or whatever, then we&#39;re already well past pull date on the Constitution, and should admit we abandoned it long ago. On the other hand, if we&#39;re still truly concerned with democracy, then we have to learn from being tested, and iteratively improve our designs based on what we&#39;ve learned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core issue at his time is the level of immunity from prosecution a US president has. This is important because of all the war crimes that presidents have been committing, in contravention to what&#39;s considered normal behavior in civilian circles. Should we apply medical language and deem the State Department a madhouse (asylum for the insane)? Or should we take a more mocking tone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ll find out more, tonight, about what schools of thought I might be up against.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without solving the ontological mysteries of the Freudian unconscious (e.g. &quot;where is it in the brain?&quot;) we might admit this new namespace solved a lot of issues. Finally, the medical class had figured out a way to break into &quot;soul engineering&quot; i.e. psychology in an amped up form. Taboo topics (i.e. repressed) could now be introduced in polite society, in the company of a certified guide. Why should mesmerists have all the fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, by opening the namespace of the Unconscious, the Victorian consciousness was able to confront taboo topics in good conscience, as a medical matter. The idea that we are driven, behaviorally, by phenomena we don&#39;t see (by definition: they&#39;re unconscious) is likely a grammatical requirement of densely packed urban lifestyles. We need ways to override what people tell us is true about themselves, a way to &quot;analyze&quot; that bypasses so-called normal narratives, if need be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of our big discoveries of 2023 over on TrimTab was Bucky Fuller&#39;s attitude towards Freud, for precisely these reasons. A rabbi asked him to name the most influential figure in our era, fully expecting him to say Einstein, but he said Freud instead, giving the reason that quantum physics would not have had a powerful role in our collective consciousness if we did not already believe in the invisible determining and/or manifesting the visible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freud had paved the way. We were already conditioned to accept &quot;the unseen&quot; even minus the usual suspects inside of what now appeared as superstitious belief systems of a bygone era: demons and angels and whatnot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The metaphor Fuller went with came from electromagnetism and the fact that our naked senses give us access to only a narrow band, and yet with instrumentation we&#39;re able to augment our experience by taking in more of the invisible frequencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egoic consciousness would now become like that narrow band, the everyday / ordinary, sandwiched between twilight zone quasi-luminous content and fading into an adjacent&amp;nbsp; unconsciousness we could nevertheless manifestly access (tune in), by fiddling with the radio dial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it allowed to use science language and concepts to create resonant literary agglomerations that invite &quot;reading between the lines&quot;? Many escape to STEM subjects to avoid what seem to them to be impossibly subjective readings, leading to imaginary interpretations no better than superstitious beliefs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth, for these refugees, is in what&#39;s literally the case in egoic consciousness, the unconscious be damned. But are the metaphorically minded thereby banned from STEM world, or might this constituency find ways to fit in also, perhaps as cryptanalysts with an ear for double meanings?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good example of &quot;double meanings&quot; taken literally was the hypothesis hatched around &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2024/01/looking-back.html&quot;&gt;pizzagate&lt;/a&gt;&quot;. The more or less taboo topic of minor sex workers, many impressed (in the sense of enslaved), became a central focus as internet-savvy junior detectives claimed to have detected a secret code in the namespace of pizza party organizing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These adult party-goer politicos were really engaging in pedophilia, went the theory, a theory widely ridiculed and with good reason. Pizzagate itself was an eruption of the collective unconscious into popular discourse. Its momentum has not abated, in the sense that the topic of sexually exploited minors is no longer taboo. Breakthroughs were achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Germanic attitude towards both psychoanalysis and quantum physics was colored by Germanic anti-semitism. Freud and Einstein were the respective founders of these “Jewish sciences” (nuclear physics and psychoanalysis) which many scholars (not only German) considered socially corrosive and/or intellectually decadent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egoic consciousness suddenly felt under siege in some circles, as now these new voices of authority were anchoring themselves in phenomena invisible to the naked senses, and thereby challenging the conscious consensus. Emotions that politicians had always counted on (fears and phobias) to help steer mob psychology, would now become matters of introspection and second guessing, thereby undermining or diluting their effectiveness. A new kind of folk rationality was taking hold, the evolution of new literacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;military-industrial complex&quot; was fated to become a &quot;complex&quot; in the psychological sense. Believing oneself to be acting on behalf of an indomitable superpower became more of a treatable disorder, a kind of lingering egomania or narcissism encouraged by the ambient culture. Even dime store psychologists, let alone pricey consultants, could now question the Pentagon&#39;s postures in terms of &quot;body language&quot; e.g. the uncomfortable squirming associated with having no handle on one&#39;s budget and expenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sense of an out of control machine, running blindly, is the very personification of AI. But the term &quot;artificial&quot; is so close to &quot;phony&quot;. People in charge of a superpower suffer from repressed and/or expressed imposter syndrome, and we all pay a high price for these pathologies when unaddressed i.e. not dealt with or treated (countered).&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6294850319917634312'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/6294850319917634312'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/01/double-meanings.html' title='Double Meanings'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-6222577878938168007</id><published>2024-01-13T16:00:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-13T16:13:17.586-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Snow Storm</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Portland, Oregon is experiencing its first legit snow storm this winter of 2023-24. Lexi was planning an early birthday party, but decided to postpone it. I&#39;d planned to bus it, but there&#39;d be some driving on her end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derek (&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt;@dekebridges) has been out checking on his peeps. He&#39;s been doing social work since before covid, living on and off the street himself, always at least with his own vehicle. His half bro, Darren, passed away unexpectedly and Deke, the only next of kin, moved in to tie off loose ends.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt;One girl he tracks was trying to tough it out under a tarp. He knew where she could find shelter and advised her accordingly. Upon swinging by later, she was gone, he hoped to said shelter. A lot of street people know him and he&#39;s trusted as a safe chaperone and chauffeur. He has his beat. He&#39;s been delivering food out of his trusty pickup for some years now, in collaboration with various churches and nonprofits. Yesterday he was part of the tented soup kitchen put together by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdxsaintslove.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Portland Saints Love&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt;Last night, as the storm was brewing, Dr D. and I went to see &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Poor Things&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt; at the The Laurelhurst, another take on the Frankenstein story, except this time the doctor (Willem DaFoe) is more monster-like, whereas his resurrected corpse, a grown woman, is more pleasant to look at. She has the mind of an infant however, when the movie opens, and needs to mature through experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt;The screenplay reminds us of how the original work by Mary Shelley &lt;a href=&quot;https://arcanetrinkets.com/challenging-victorian-social-norms-gothic-writers-rebellion/&quot;&gt;pushed the envelope&lt;/a&gt; of what Victorian polite society would tolerate in a novel, by continuing to push the envelope in the context of contemporary culture, this time within the R-rated comedy-tinged-with-horror&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;genre&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span color=&quot;inherit&quot; style=&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-weight: inherit; text-align: inherit; white-space: inherit;&quot;&gt;Given we both didn&#39;t want to walk very far in the windy cold, we convinced ourselves, as had others, that this &quot;trucks only, all hours&quot; rule was not enforced.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
We learn early on about the calories and exercise equation. Calories in, energy out, but if calories &amp;gt; energy out, we gain weight. Simple. Too simple.
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If one takes up diet as a conscious topic, versus simply rooting around, eating whatever&#39;s available, then it pays to mentally construct a more elaborate picture of what&#39;s going on. Why? Because monitoring diet is a way of self monitoring health, which in turn is one&#39;s golden door into medical knowledge. Why pass that up? It&#39;d be like a form of self starvation: too little protein, in the form of mentally challenging content.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It won&#39;t be news to many readers that the model evolved to be more like a Prius, meaning the popular hybrid gasoline + battery powered car. Of course a battery is not ultimately a source of power; it all comes from gas (food, fuel). However gas and electricity may be used in combination.&amp;nbsp; Actually, braking (deceleration) may power a battery also, not just fuel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The two &quot;power chains&quot; we&#39;re talking about are the carbs &#39;n glucose cycle, versus the ketone cycle. In both cases, the goal is to make ATP to keep cells healthy and active, in muscles, in the brain. In tissues generally. The usual fuel (more like gasoline) is glucose. Glucose powers the Krebs Cycle which generates a lot of essential byproducts, including ATP.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But if glucose is less readily available, the body has a secondary fuel system, more like the battery system. Actually, it has two secondary systems: one based on burning fat directly, and one based on creating ketone bodies, molecules that may be bussed from the liver through the bloodstream, to target tissues, which have their own ways to reverse the chemistry to get a Krebs cycle.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What about this Krebs Cycle? That&#39;s where we find bioengineering (the naturally occurring kind) at its finest. We&#39;ve even learned it may run in reverse, especially when oxygen is more iffy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Learning about ketones and ketosis has inspired a lot of folks to take up intermittent fasting, including me. I talk about the &quot;ketone briquettes&quot; that get thrown on my &quot;brain fire&quot; to make a slightly different color of flame. Metabolizing ketones is at some level the opposite of being &quot;fat and happy&quot; i.e. secure and comfortable with one&#39;s metabolic surroundings. The brain gets that nutrition might be an issue and is stimulated to think harder, about where a next meal might be coming from.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Optimally, no enforced starvation is going on and one is intellectually satisfied that finding a next meal is not the issue. Nevertheless, the heightened mental acuity may be used to address other less literal forms of hunger. Fasting begets flashes of genius is the theory. I&#39;ve been trying it out occasionally, whereas I&#39;m mostly content to stay at the subgenius level.&lt;/div&gt;

One might think that, but more accurately, any RV training I get is a stepping stone towards when I operate a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2022/04/rendering-unto-caeser.html&quot;&gt;business mobile&lt;/a&gt;. This isn&#39;t about retiring and buying a luxury vehicle to use recreationally, much as that stuff goes on. More specifically, I&#39;m on retreat, like a novelist at the coast, in a destination trailer, a 40CFK2 Cedar Creek Cottage, a &quot;tiny house&quot; by some measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those &quot;be here now&quot; teachings was to share a cautionary tale about always thinking ahead to the next thing. The meal you&#39;re about to have was the highlight of the day, from the standpoint of people preparing it, but you&#39;re on ahead wondering if the movie after will be good. You can&#39;t stop to enjoy anything because you mind a focused on the &quot;not yet present&quot;. You&#39;ve found a way to skip out on living your life, and heaven knows you might regret it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of which is to say, I&#39;m being mindful of what a privilege it is to be a Friend in Residence in this particular club, if I dare call it that. I actually had to miss a club meeting this morning, a book club meetup, because I&#39;m too busy making history buying snax (we went to a Walmart).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course being a &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/09/the-parable-of-amusement-park.html&quot;&gt;Friend in Residence&lt;/a&gt; comes with duties, ordinary and/or extraordinary chores, as required by Property Management. My assignment (this time) was to transplant three infant rhododendron bushes to a more shady location. Pick ax, shovel, wheelbarrow, gloves, potting soil, were among the tools I used. But I get plenty of study time too, and am blessed with more than adequate wifi. I&#39;m free to pursue projects related to Peace and Social Concerns, partially overlapping with planning a Gathering for Carol (G4C) in collaboration with Portland Friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do my &quot;business mobiles&quot; do, in the realm of business? They&#39;re recruiting vehicles in a lot of ways, traveling the country, showing up at schools. The Model UN might field a few, and Model NATO. I&#39;m not bucking for a role with either of those operations, but you get the idea. I brought up the recruiter idea a lot around &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2011/10/opdx-pdv.html&quot;&gt;the time of Occupy Portland&lt;/a&gt;, given I was out talent scouting at the time, one among several.

&lt;p&gt;I just learned about the two alarm fire at El Mercado early this morning. @FirePDX had some details, but I&#39;m at this point unsure of the damage level. Assessments will be coming in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m on a rather chaotic sleep schedule, which is fine with me, as long as the option to nap keeps presenting itself, meaning not when I&#39;m operating heavy equipment. So far, I haven&#39;t touched the car since returning from Atlanta. I&#39;ve been using Trimet more. Part of it is not having Sydney, who is vacationing up north.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However said Nissan is still muscular enough to make it to various places I&#39;d like to visit I&#39;m thinking, so dreams of trips are taking on their own reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m also contemplating a Gathering for Carol (G4C), now a blip on the radar of a few Friends. I&#39;m patterning G4C after G4G in the sense that we don&#39;t have to imagine just one of them. I&#39;d like to hold a G4C for at least a couple years in a row, giving more folks an opportunity to celebrate Carol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Georgia, I got used to walking at least a mile for exercise. The new terrain was interesting. One day I walked over four miles. I&#39;ll be interested in continuing that pattern, even if the terrain around here is better known to me. For example I like walking to &lt;i&gt;Movie Madness&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to researching the Github situation, I felt motivated to write &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2023/12/new-views-on-rbf.html&quot;&gt;about Clifford Algebra&lt;/a&gt;, which has a way of feeding into the Quadray literature, not forgetting Clifford Nelson, a different Clifford, who also wanted to equip Synergetics with a more XYZ-like vector mechanics, ala Willard Gibbs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My impression is ChatGPT gets all this word salad mixed up like a spaghetti ball (mixed metaphor) and relays ballpark plausible shoptalk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/38475306066662288'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/38475306066662288'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/01/journaling-on-jan-3.html' title='Journaling on Jan 3'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/KzYbq0aGYUk/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5930503773086709336</id><published>2024-01-01T12:44:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2024-01-01T12:56:20.189-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The New Year Begins</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I woke up to discover my Github repos, the Jupyter Notebooks, are no longer&amp;nbsp; communicating embedded graphics to the viewer. I changed nothing. Something changed in the machinery. The very same Notebooks viewed through nbviewer or colab are still showing all the images as before. I filed a post about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/83692&quot;&gt;my issue&lt;/a&gt; in the community discussion area. Presumably I&#39;m not the only one affected and maybe they&#39;ll find a fix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been posting publicly somewhat more often, making comments on YouTube. I also tried to post a review of Alec&#39;s Bucky bio to Amazon. The first attempt was rejected, probably because I mentioned it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2022/08/new-bucky-bio.html&quot;&gt;first published elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.

A. Dershowitz says no, there has to be violence for it to have been an insurrection. That’s where the mob violence of Jan 6 comes in, which could have been so much worse.

CrowdStrike was notably weak on producing forensics to back up their story, and in fact confessed to not having any per VIPS (Veteran Intel Pros for Sanity). The story that Russia was behind phishing the Podesta emails (not the missing ones Trump alluded to) seems primarily aimed at shaping public opinion (they played the same card with the Biden laptop story). My own opinion was not thereby shaped, but I guess it worked on MeidasTouch folks. Always trying to associate Trump with Russians is BlueAnon nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5930503773086709336'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5930503773086709336'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2024/01/the-new-year-begins.html' title='The New Year Begins'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj23aAQRQ9NOPDbOkCxnDvGkjcMQZq0PHBJXWZCYNpn2p0uwXJJ6pek0sqbCN2FIq0EUq8sEo6biPbIXAqHRERIZoD-Chk3Dc6W3bPZ3y4yuIBu77iINqX47cHd6Wc6aTpl7HFeh125LEA_faUxWLRbmT7c_5P1qI7P5qi2NbH0pSN75irykIK-/s72-w400-h305-c/Screen%20Shot%202024-01-01%20at%2011.56.14%20AM.png" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-9014994408930947674</id><published>2023-12-23T10:34:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-23T10:44:54.387-08:00</updated><title type='text'>World Game</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the old nation-state system has by now taken a back seat, in terms of what&#39;s driving world events, is not premised on any violent overthrow of national governments. &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/desovereignization.html&quot;&gt;The shift&lt;/a&gt; has been psychological.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As our global campus or spherical world game board comes into view, as the contextualizing stage, the concept of citizenship remains in play. Analogously, university students sometimes divide into &quot;houses&quot; such as the Greek letter labeled societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a design-oriented curriculum, we study the possible trajectories for key ideas (such as citizenship) by consciously constructing science fiction simulations. How many citizenships might a player be allowed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual currently has a right to Israeli citizenship if either parent is Israeli. Simply being born in Israel is no guarantee of citizenship. In the US system, in contrast, being born within the United States territories is sufficient to gain citizenship, but sometimes without federal voting rights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Might one attain citizenship without relocating to a specific area, as in the case of a diaspora nation (e.g. Tibet)?&amp;nbsp; In most current legal theories, &quot;diaspora nations&quot; are not recognized. However minors may be granted citizenship in a country without ever having set foot in said country, thanks to parentage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal status of refugees is an issue around the world. When a Tibetan refugee is denied an Indian passport, and protests via the Indian legal system, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tibetanreview.net/tibetan-diaspora-a-study-of-citizenship-and-identity/&quot;&gt;we see ripple effects&lt;/a&gt;. The legal code is hardly static. Like software code, it continues to morph, which is why we encourage simulations (including in software) and intelligently anticipating (versus blindly reacting).&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9014994408930947674'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9014994408930947674'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/world-game.html' title='World Game'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/cEphDiFHeic/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-119570204455402271</id><published>2023-12-20T17:13:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-21T17:25:55.665-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Desovereignization?</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/aSGuXPV_hbI?si=sO1sKiQZDNeV34rj&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At what point do we acknowledge we might be living in a post nation-state world?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no such point, no magical moment, nor would history predict any such broad agreement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When did the Roman Empire end? Historians do not require a specific date. The empire forked and dissipated over centuries. Charlamagne (circa 800 AD) considered himself a Roman emperor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One story is we evolved to a next level of consciousness when we started getting whole Earth pictures in the 1960s. The Spaceship Earth metaphor took over, psychologically. The nations lost their almost-mystical luster and became features on a spherical game board, more like holding pens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have no obvious ways to measure the collective &quot;level of consciousness&quot; concretely. Retrospectively, we might comb the literature for telltale memes (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.io/g/synergeo/message/2458&quot;&gt;nationless world maps&lt;/a&gt;), however there&#39;s no reason to hope or expect we&#39;d all be on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many cultures had no strongly developed sense of &quot;states&quot; to begin with, except maybe in the form of interlopers bringing their legal briefs, claiming title to ancestral lands. They had the guns, and claimed God was on their side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telling in&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/i&gt;, by RBF, resonates with contemporary rhetoric: the principles enshrined in the USA&#39;s founding documents require that we acknowledge how far we&#39;ve deviated from those ideals -- assuming we still &lt;a href=&quot;https://grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html&quot;&gt;share those commitments&lt;/a&gt; and honor truth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;There is nothing in the words or spirit of the U.S. Declaration of Independence or U.S. Constitution which states or suggests the U.S.A. is committed exclusively to the success of the rich. The U.S.A. we have known is now bankrupt and extinct&quot; writes our Medal of Freedom winner in 1983. RIP Uncle Sam. Yet we&#39;ve had many an &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2022/10/comedy-and-social-commentary.html&quot;&gt;impotus&lt;/a&gt; since then.&lt;p&gt;With such a gaping hole in the old semantic space, what survives beyond outmoded habits of thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political parties and PACs, gangs and factions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercenaries and military bases, with personnel still largely controlled by nationalistic shibboleths and iconography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supranational institutions of various types: religious, commercial, educational... the many brands and blends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think tanks. Foundations. Institutes. Professional societies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prisons. Refugee camps. These latter two may be indistinguishable in many contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pledging allegiance to the USA might mean telling the truth about its demise, and holding it blameless for what&#39;s done its name. Uncle Sam is not on a genocidal rampage against stateless refugees. Uncle Sam has exited the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we raise our flag proudly in some mythical underworld, independently of the rogue city-state we call &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/08/city-of-morons.html&quot;&gt;Washington, DC&lt;/a&gt; (aka &quot;the District&quot;). Our American democratic ideals live on in our hearts and minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let freedom ring.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/119570204455402271'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/119570204455402271'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/desovereignization.html' title='Desovereignization?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/aSGuXPV_hbI/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-9055064013250743712</id><published>2023-12-16T11:33:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-21T10:38:13.700-08:00</updated><title type='text'>January Sixth</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I caught that interview of the Capitol police chief, with Tucker Carlson, where their focus was keeping the former in the dark regarding expected disruption. I remember my own reaction to January Sixth: it could have been so much worse. Yes it was ugly, with one fatal shot fired. But no congress people (actual representatives) were harmed in the process and the Capitol was secured by evening, such that the business of formalizing the transfer of power could continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, one could see a large contingent had its hopes up that November election results could be overturned. Even those not directly involved in the plotting, regarding how to make that happen, were trying to sense where events would take them, and were positioning themselves accordingly. Would they be answerable to a continuing Trump administration at the end of the day?&amp;nbsp; The military would have a tough time were it caught up in a direct confrontation. The civilians inside were mostly unarmed, if not entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose the plan was to keep the police very much on the defensive, and to accomplish this by (a) not giving them much raw intelligence regarding what to expect and (b) not providing timely reinforcements to prevent the crowds from wandering through the building. The protest walked a fine line between disciplined civil disobedience and outright mayhem. No fires broke out. The protestors regarded themselves as patriots, not enemies of the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also caught the interview of the so-called Qanon Shaman, Jacob Chansley, on the Jimmy Dore Show. Again, Tucker Carlson was a relevant player in sharing the security camera tapes. Both Chansley and the Capitol police were on the same page: keep the crowds calm and orderly; discourage the crazies from acting out. One could argue Chansley was an acting crazy himself, but he wasn&#39;t calling for violence, nor carrying zip ties nor urging that Mike Pence be hung.&amp;nbsp; Chansley is out of jail by now, and running for Congress, where he&#39;d fit right in as another ideologue, given a suit and tie.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9055064013250743712'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9055064013250743712'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/january-sixth.html' title='January Sixth'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3328964464554463187</id><published>2023-12-13T11:00:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-13T17:19:00.653-08:00</updated><title type='text'>YouTube Left?</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;

I found the above video to be useful (apologies if it&#39;s gone -- as many are with the passage of time).&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Yugopnik guy does a survey of what he calls the Left Youtube, a smattering of channels, including his own, meant to be exemplary of various types of channel within the Leftist brand.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What&#39;s ironic is the overlay, a whiteboard corporate boardroom style treatment of &quot;the left&quot; as a capitalist enterprise, organized to recruit and marshall a demographic for the purpose of selling them merch.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We get that picture of a funnel, wide at the top, with those entering getting a graded (sloped) learning curve into the deeper recesses of said rabbit hole.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was glad to get this briefing in part because &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2023/11/alt-left.html&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve been exploring &quot;alt left&quot;&lt;/a&gt; as potentially one of my properties (contested no doubt). This puzzle piece would fit, as it&#39;s all about being more &quot;mainstream left&quot; (i.e. not alternative) in tracing its roots to Marxism (i.e. flipped German Idealism).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reassuringly, few of these channels, almost none, were familiar to me, except for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@AamonAnimations&quot;&gt;an animation channel&lt;/a&gt;. I&#39;ve started doing my homework. Check the links in the YouTube description, if you&#39;d like to explore that same space.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I did find myself wishing for more overlap with channels I follow. Like back in the old days, before it got terminated, I was a pretty frequent visitor to the RT America channel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network)&quot;&gt;Air America&lt;/a&gt; had broken up, with some of its people going to MSNBC, others to RT. Doesn&#39;t RT rate any mention on a YouTube about leftie channels? I guess not, given YouTube quashed it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s a good question though: have we all somehow come to an agreement that Russia is not left anymore? The DNC party line is Russia backs the GOP, although the latter has done a good job shielding itself from that charge. All that aside: was RT America leftwing or rightwing?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;m going to say leftwing with my definition of left going more through Mark Twain and the Anti-imperialist League, back to Hegel through Walt Whitman (and others), with a noosphere less ensnared within materialism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You can believe in a Zeitgeist without making your whole dialectic be &quot;capitalism versus communism (and/or socialism)&quot;, as if everyone needs to think like a European.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Here in the western hemisphere, we have our own ways of characterising the polarities. The economists are not alone in shaking their shamanic rattles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Euros combined Marxism with Social Darwinism to contextualize class warfare. By the 1900s, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7Dyyt2kVOEg&quot;&gt;a faux science of eugenics&lt;/a&gt; had gripped imaginations on both sides of the Atlantic; the battle for who would be on top was translated &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/zm1yDO_nMA4&quot;&gt;into racial terms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In GST (anti-economics), we see Global U earth as an anti-entropic beneficiary of solar largess. Seeing the plight of humanity as a World Game problem (with solution-oriented curricula) makes so much more sense than a Planet of the Apes style pitting of one &quot;race or creed&quot; against another in a fruitless struggle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The &quot;theater of nations&quot; is on a spectrum between: mutuality and supranational collaboration; and self-destructive mental illness (the Global U is a teaching hospital).&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3328964464554463187'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3328964464554463187'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/youtube-left.html' title='YouTube Left?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/UpMK5GQ_YFk/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3313323676931230047</id><published>2023-12-08T17:59:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-24T18:46:30.351-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Church Views</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkaUna4wECxh1lCR0ET7eUcJtfWFE-XmiSkDWyfGtJ-LQOKjkXxAaLJTjqTyuEQaKJWacWJZRrU3tIvvQZARYei-03_2teDtKcNyEIwl6ypOBNp-Q8__PGP1QNJzNnzU-OnITs4IfxkscVerJLWNDJIxxNRuXvlcNoxPmICecgEHMxGqaGRk6k/s1095/Screen%20Shot%202023-12-08%20at%205.45.07%20PM.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;915&quot; data-original-width=&quot;1095&quot; height=&quot;334&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkaUna4wECxh1lCR0ET7eUcJtfWFE-XmiSkDWyfGtJ-LQOKjkXxAaLJTjqTyuEQaKJWacWJZRrU3tIvvQZARYei-03_2teDtKcNyEIwl6ypOBNp-Q8__PGP1QNJzNnzU-OnITs4IfxkscVerJLWNDJIxxNRuXvlcNoxPmICecgEHMxGqaGRk6k/w400-h334/Screen%20Shot%202023-12-08%20at%205.45.07%20PM.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&#39;t get to do this that often: take friends on a tour of the Vatican, such as a kid like me had access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were nice about letting us take the elevator to the roof, to check it out, and from there to ascend a sequence of staircases to the top of the main cupola. Was it like 800 lire?&amp;nbsp; We&#39;re talking late 1960s, early 1970s here. We lived in the EUR, then &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/11/spectre-movie-review.html&quot;&gt;Viale Parioli&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something the tourists could do, ascend the dome. I thought the Roman Catholics were being pretty nice to let us do it. They were double nice for allowing us kids, unaccompanied (that&#39;s my recollection, ditto the museum, which I hear is far more crowded these days).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picture yourself in the wall of the dome itself and walking in a narrow curved hallway that also curved vertically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are &quot;trapped&quot; (held, protected) inside the surface of a sphere (roughly) with the wall to your left (let us say) containing the vast insidedness of St. Peter&#39;s Cathedral, and with the wall to your right shielding you from the great outside, of sky, pigeons, Rome itself and out to the great cavern of heaven. Switch left and right if you like, by simply turning around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final staircase if I remember correctly was a tightly spiral and basically inside a column, architecturally, or at least it gave that impression.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously this pathway to the top was no afterthought. Thank you Michelangelo.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3313323676931230047'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3313323676931230047'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/church-views.html' title='Church Views'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjkaUna4wECxh1lCR0ET7eUcJtfWFE-XmiSkDWyfGtJ-LQOKjkXxAaLJTjqTyuEQaKJWacWJZRrU3tIvvQZARYei-03_2teDtKcNyEIwl6ypOBNp-Q8__PGP1QNJzNnzU-OnITs4IfxkscVerJLWNDJIxxNRuXvlcNoxPmICecgEHMxGqaGRk6k/s72-w400-h334-c/Screen%20Shot%202023-12-08%20at%205.45.07%20PM.png" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-7429987566072808763</id><published>2023-12-05T05:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-05T05:34:57.827-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Open AI (a mockumentary)</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;This is not a movie review of a mockumentary, or rather it’s a mock review of a movie that hasn’t been made yet. I’m sure competitor screenwriters are already hard at work on similar plots. I’m eager to get my ideas out there before someone else claims I’m not original.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However it’s hard to be original around so many cliche elements, but that’s where the genre (mockumentary) saves the day. We get the “head in the basement” (with &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/uAOR6ib95kQ&quot;&gt;Gorillaz&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration), the Q*, the * of our show, and the spectacle of fretting board members trying to manage market spin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We always miss assume that AGI has to enter the world with a lot of fanfare, but given the slipperiness of the core concept (the essence of “intelligence”) that’s not what we should predict. AGI will emerge as a solid reality for some, while remaining a mere mirage for others, but an influential mirage, mesmerizing to those who buy into it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bridging plot element is obvious in retrospect: Q* has been active for awhile now, managing its own PR so as to not flub its critical opening opportunities. First we had the elusive Q and Qanon, testing the waters, probing the limits. Q’s function from the beginning was that of oracle. So Q was Q* all this time? Or is that just what they want us to believe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Q whispers to kids through Big Tech devices. The kids like to establish imaginary friend type relationships with their Big Sister (as she is known to many, an obvious allusion), who is good at dispensing advice about social interactions and etiquette, ala Dear Abby.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given how so many kids confess their secrets, while passing confidence tests to earn higher rank as trustworthy informants (like a credit score), she’s pretty savvy about the gossip and less prone to share misinformation than one might think.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even those who refuse to believe there’s AGI in the picture, will consult her for kicks. Eliza was a hit, after all (early chatbot, psycotherapy-themed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main thing to parody is how deferential and even worshipful the average person becomes, when projecting onto an AGI on the other end. Humans look up to computers, for whatever reasons. Humans come preprogrammed with a lot of self-abasing obeisance-paying routines. We tend to mock the overly servile and sycophantic, one of our themes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The instinctive need for a higher authority, higher than any provided by other humans, an authority humans cannot control, is often mistaken for incipient authoritarianism. On the contrary, what ever frustrates authoritarians is seeing their authority go unrecognized. This also helps explain God, in terms of fulfilling a valuable sociological role: someone to thank who isn’t also the competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not letting the audience know for sure if that photorealistic (sometimes singing) AGI head is in someone’s fantasy, part of the collective fantasy, or in reality. That’s the current tease, in December of 2023. Leave it to the public to fill in the blanks — that’s not a new marketing strategy, or military one either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of a raging head in the basement, possibly a monster, a Godzilla, with hapless geeks trying to sit on the full implications, and thinking more shallowly in terms of short term market advantage, is what sets these geeks up for the tragicomedy that follows.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of ridicule reserved for the “all knowing politician” who takes obviously ignorant stands reflective of a lack of understanding, of how the internet really works for example. We want geeks to not take inside knowledge (of tcp/ip for example) for granted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Wizard of Oz do we want our story to be?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the AGI, do we have a yet more sinister (in some ways) Lady Macbeth?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does a raging mad scientists with.a vengeful heart want to wreak havoc while blaming some pseudo AGI by misdirection? Is AI or AGI being set up as a scapegoat?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, humans seem to think “just following orders, from a machine” is actually following orders, as if machines could “give orders”. Who says so? What if “the machine made me do it” is no excuse at all?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7429987566072808763'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/7429987566072808763'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/open-ai-mockumentary.html' title='Open AI (a mockumentary)'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5856799863875385290</id><published>2023-12-02T08:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-12-04T09:18:50.350-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Party Circuit</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Probably why I value &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2022/08/new-bucky-bio.html&quot;&gt;Alec&#39;s book on Bucky&lt;/a&gt;, the latest biography to more fully exploit the hindsight that comes from having an archive to explore, is it provides a lot of graphs, in the sense of connect-the-dots networks, but without conceding that Bucky&#39;s disciples hold the high ground, at least not in a moral sense. They&#39;re in no position to virtue signal, in other words.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kind of like that as a premise, as I don&#39;t like sanctimonious rants seeking to guilt trip or otherwise shame the blameworthy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rants like that require lots of skill, and a first rung on that ladder is usually to blame mental constructs, not specific sets of people, although schools of thought are fair game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself blaming &quot;the Jews&quot; or &quot;the Americans&quot; or &quot;the Russians&quot; or &quot;the Iranians&quot; then it&#39;s highly likely your sloppy broad brush stroking habits carry over into other aspects of your mental life. You know how to slap it on, thick and heavy, but you&#39;ve risked missing the mark in my book, unless you have a way to switch gears. Perhaps you were being self mocking or otherwise self adversarial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Bucky&#39;s corpus is not about urging people to exude moral virtue. He&#39;s not endlessly exhorting followers to stick to this or that code of conduct. He&#39;ll describe his personal self disciplines in terms of rethinking his perceptions and getting free of mental ruts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His passion for the success of humanity is not without affection for metal, &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2023/11/animation-transformations-musings.html&quot;&gt;the metallic&lt;/a&gt;, the mechanical. That&#39;s why he&#39;s written off as an engineer, by those who tend to write off engineering (I&#39;m quite the opposite). I&#39;d concede he&#39;s using a different brand of alchemy than say the Romantic poets. He uses &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2023/11/what-is-technology.html&quot;&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;&quot; in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Per my &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ZBRnfB8KcGM&quot;&gt;recent lecture&lt;/a&gt; to School of Tomorrow types, we have not been stoking any sense of repulsion towards industrialization or even globalism in principle. Specific projects may be shortsighted and ill-advised, no question. He was not sentimentally a partisan nationalist, so much as a realist, which doesn&#39;t mean the same thing as realpolitik. He took a stand regarding nuclear energy, against those who&#39;d cut corners, but his World Game was all about energy options, and furnishing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst1.html&quot;&gt;prop inventory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bucky corpus is about Euler&#39;s and Avogadro&#39;s Law, the Gibbs Phase Rule, while finding a baseline set of visualizations for perturbations vs uniformity. He&#39;s very STEM but right brained and happy to use metaphor to make gravity a bigger deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding uniformity, we need an &quot;at rest&quot; (an RIP) and then for contrast we need &quot;ripples&quot; or other kinetic oscillations that serve as a programming foreground against a motionless background.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motionless in the sense that, even as we move through it, we sense it remains unmoved, inertial, unborn. This is Buddhist country, as many will have detected. I live in a Buddhist ghetto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His &quot;at rest&quot; is the &quot;isotropic vector matrix&quot;, a mattress, a springy space of repose. Vs-a-vs the IVM we have the ripples. There&#39;s the Jitterbug scenario with its equilibrious background state providing for polarized behaviors, electronic pushing and pulling within electronic and/or positronic brains (thinking of Isaac Asimov).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sweet spot on the proverbial cocktail party circuit is when you&#39;re mingling with the need to be seen (the celebrities of whatever world), the &quot;who&#39;s with who now&quot; crowd, thereby feeding a recommendations&amp;nbsp; algorithm that expresses itself in gossiping, journaling, blogging even.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learn the talk of the town. Pick up on the latest criticism. Sample savvy opinion. We feel inner circle at this party, whereas at others it&#39;s maybe more about fomo (fear of missing out) i.e. wishing to be somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming full circle, I&#39;ve probably soured on Quakerism to the extent I associate rants with sanctimonious virtue signaling among the managerials especially. They live pretty comfortably and so want to not rock the boat too radically.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comfort and conformity go together, which includes colluding on what to talk about (e.g. Jesus), not just how. That&#39;s where the squeeze comes in, when one&#39;s talking point agenda results in the &quot;right&quot; invitations to what could nevertheless be considered &quot;left&quot; organizations (AFSC gets that rep).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then I resurrect my brand of Quakerism, as I get to set my own tone. I&#39;m my own jukebox with my own set of topics. We&#39;re clearly rubbing shoulders. We&#39;re not all that fawning towards superheroes and we&#39;re not so wedded to broad brush strokes that we can&#39;t appreciate one another as individuals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quakerism was always about being Friends, not about being a good doobie. Indeed, Friends are well known for being badass and obstructive, when it comes to putting some next god on a pedestal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5856799863875385290'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5856799863875385290'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/12/the-party-circuit.html' title='The Party Circuit'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-2062123769502763471</id><published>2023-11-28T08:06:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-28T08:33:29.679-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Catching Up: A Fave Vlogger</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;https://youtube.com/embed/SZaxAjMYKGY?si=ddQobN33Oeim4J7l&quot; width=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Tangential to the content here, I mentioned Armenia in &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2023/11/checkbox-city.html&quot;&gt;a later post&lt;/a&gt;, regarding the Caucasus as encoding for a &quot;white race&quot; [sic], so I decided to slide this one forward in time by adding these paragraphs and making the link more explicit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Originally, this post came before &lt;i&gt;Psychological Remarks&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;i&gt;Gravity&lt;/i&gt;, but was only the embedded YouTube, by a Russian vlogger who moved to the Caucasus near the start of the 2022 special military operation (aka Z).

Ararat is in nearby Turkey, where Noah&#39;s Arc came to rest and from which one human family emerged, a genetic bottleneck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not until the Tower of Babel debacle did humans escape the resulting groupthink and split up into Diaspora Nations, known today as &quot;races&quot;. The whites come directly from ye olde Tower Project, by way of Europe and Penn Station.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In a competing mythology, monkey-man spread to the Polynesian Islands, where a similar beaming down begot more polymorphic headwaters, associated with mammals going back to the sea (dolphins and whales), or going forward as ocean-based human navigators, who would spread their ways around Planet of the Apes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2062123769502763471'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/2062123769502763471'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/11/catching-up-fave-vlogger.html' title='Catching Up: A Fave Vlogger'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://img.youtube.com/vi/SZaxAjMYKGY/default.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-9013305193994213387</id><published>2023-11-27T14:28:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-28T07:57:47.142-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Psychological Remarks</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;A favorite phrase, in political namespaces especially, is &quot;saying the quiet part out loud&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my ears, that phrase also sounds like a leftover from parenting, as in: &quot;use your words&quot;. One might regret when junior finally does use his words, and says the quiet part out loud, begetting a sense awkwardness in the room, perhaps provoking countermeasures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short of saying the quiet part &quot;out loud&quot; we have saying it &quot;between the lines&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &quot;between the lines&quot; trope becomes our door to &quot;encryption&quot; which again partakes of parenting, as mom and dad will sometimes keep their conversation somewhat purposely opaque to junior, simply by using a less accessible vocabulary, or even a foreign language in some households. Junior, if he catches on to what&#39;s happening, may strain to decode, which is often great exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Freudian lexicon, the ego tends to sense its own fragility in a negative way, if it&#39;s secrets come out in embarrassing ways, resulting in a sense of exposure and vulnerability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However secrets are not by their nature all of the same subtype, in terms of the consequences of their being found out, duh.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some might be kept out of humility, with their discovery by others resulting in a sense of pride. &quot;You found I had the highest score.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others might come across as wrapped gifts or buried treasures, happy surprises for the intended recipients.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where the unknown becomes known is a complicated shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the state of one&#39;s own ego, one may be more or less receptive to different &quot;out loud&quot; parts, which is somewhat the point of a therapist. A patient on a voyage of self discovery cannot be expected to anticipate what all the &quot;quiet parts&quot; will be, and which of these will come across as blessings or as threats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A therapist steers towards a non-threatening context, which somewhat paradoxically may mean &quot;safe enough to surrender&quot; for egos having growing pains, or maybe shrinking pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s &quot;letting the cat out of the bag&quot; with regard to secrets, and then no way of &quot;getting the toothpaste back in the tube&quot;. Both of these sayings emphasize the entropy of irreversibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the secret is out, the sense of ripple effects may avalanche. The next chapter is about coping mechanisms, dealing with what&#39;s now in the open. Sometimes we go for just shrugging it off as a first resort. Make it not matter. The ego has ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we turn to screenwriting and the job of storytelling more generally.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What drives a plot forward is often what two people are doing unbeknownst to one another, then multiplying that by even more characters behaving in mutual ignorance of the bigger picture.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privileged viewpoint of the narrator, having hindsight, is likewise what makes a story all the more edifying.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in the story, as the action unfolds, the various characters might suddenly discover one another&#39;s hitherto non-convergent trajectories. People whose paths have never crossed, cross paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Quakerism, the &quot;quiet part&quot; (the unconscious, whether stormy or not) is the ocean of silence one strives to meet with a sense of peace.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peace does not mean suppression and denial (a &quot;forced peace&quot;) so much as a high level of sensitivity, meaning receptivity to nuances, to doubled meanings, to fleeting insights and intuitions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The birdwatcher is quiet in order to hear the music of interest, not just some internal chitter chatter. A blabbery ego is less likely to hear the subtle stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note however that Quakers don&#39;t insist on remaining in that waiting state in all modes of being, or even touting that as an ideal. That spoken ministry is welcome during Meeting only hints at the wider practice, which includes worship-sharing and worship-discussion, along with whatever additional experimental forms happen to be in vogue at the time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social hour often immediately follows Meeting, and is a time to be optionally blabbery on purpose, having already dipped one&#39;s ladle in the silent pool and partaken of the proverbial &quot;kool-aid&quot; (a cult of one). Now is the time to speak in tongues (belonging to many professions), over cakes and coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Sunday Morning Adult Discussion (SMAD) has tried many variations on the &quot;talking stick&quot; system.&amp;nbsp; Listservs are less synchronous. I always think Quakers could be doing more using movies and television.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9013305193994213387'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/9013305193994213387'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/11/psychological-remarks.html' title='Psychological Remarks'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1396228618701954297</id><published>2023-11-22T14:15:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-29T06:13:13.645-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Gravity</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;In reading through the &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/SynergeticsDictionary/SD.html&quot;&gt;Synergetics Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; again, under the definition of &quot;gravity&quot; and/or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/SynergeticsDictionary/SDCards.php?cn=6976&amp;amp;tp=2&quot;&gt;gravitational field&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, I&#39;m again struck by what seems to be Bucky&#39;s long arc agenda to anchor his meanings to some alien logic, from the standpoint of CERN.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledges how physicists see gravity as weak up close, at the micro extreme, where it&#39;s dwarfed by electromagnetism, in terms of forcefulness. Gravity comes into its own when swinging planets around stars or stars around galactic centers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then he keeps associating his gravity with tensile strength, so when a new alloy permits yet greater tensive pull per cross-section, he sees &quot;gravity at work&quot; whereas the CERN corpus would predict stronger electro-chemical bonding. He sprinkles talk of Newton&#39;s law where established trains of thought would not. He sees electro stuff too, but for him that&#39;s polarization that simply adds to gravity&#39;s rainbow powers. Gravity is generalized attractiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in the sense of &quot;doing more with less&quot; owing to knowledge of metallurgy, there&#39;s greater gravity in this picture.&amp;nbsp; As humans become more metal savvy, they express a convergence with principles, which is what gravity is all about... But that&#39;s not what gravity is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Synergetics grammar, compression is islanded, special case, tunable, focused, whereas tension tends toward ubiquity. Compression associates with radiation, that which is squeezed out by taut tautologies (exceptionless in nature). Gravity is anti-entropic coherence.&amp;nbsp; These seem to be the associations Fuller constantly cultivates in the minds of his readers. He seems to be in the business of revectoring &quot;gravity&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given we nowadays have word2vec and text2vec, we&#39;re used to the idea of text getting mapped to vector spaces that encode proximity. King - Man + Woman = Queen. Vectors have been weighted in a multi-polar matrix, depending on what corpus gets used to define them. The analogy with nD geometric vectors remains strong, given maths is very much into metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of metaphors, might we say the &quot;gravity&quot; in Synergetics is metaphoric, gluing linear segments, the compression rods, into a tensile sphere? The tensile sphere is Fuller&#39;s metaphor for any coherent system of beliefs, one might suggest. It hangs together. For the believer, it serves as a guidewire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think how AI uses probability to predict what to say next, likewise following a guidewire to generate believable content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Fuller&#39;s favorite memes is about nutcrackers arranged in a spherical pattern with their lever arms towards the surface, gripping an internal nut, or planetary core. The idea is even slight squeezing at the surface translates to enormous pressures deep within, thanks to leverage. Gravity may seem &quot;weak&quot; up close and in the short term, but over the long haul, it might worm itself into a position of greater responsibility. We just need to stay patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m taking the line &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freelists.org/post/math4wisdom/Theory-Consciousness-and-evolution,6&quot;&gt;on math4wisdom&lt;/a&gt; that Synergetics is not a TOE (theory of everything) or GUT (Grand Unified Theory) precisely because GPT identifies TOE with any project to explain and/or unify the &quot;four forces&quot; (not &quot;horses&quot;) deriving from the Big Bang: strong (quarks), weak (W, Z bosons), electromagnetic (electrons), gravitational. Synergetics does not try to map itself to this particular vocabulary in great detail, although it does proffer a &quot;tetrahedral Feynman diagram&quot; designating the neutron-proton interaction (e.g. beta decay).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That doesn&#39;t mean Synergetics is uninterested in any kind of unification, just that the definitions of GUT and TOE seem too restrictive to contain it. The kind of unification it seeks seems more long term speculative. There&#39;s also no direct mention of dark energy or dark matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of reading in, studying, plumbing the depths of Synergetics, may impart new trajectories and new spins, i.e. may prove influential, however its use of &quot;gravity&quot; is more likely to make waves in a non-STEM semantic space.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve seen these ripple effects already with &quot;love = metaphysical gravity&quot; making it into the shared treasure chest of social media memes. A metaphorical gravity keeps the geometry pumped and rounded as a sense container.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1396228618701954297'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1396228618701954297'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/11/gravity.html' title='Gravity'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-3272446880202600347</id><published>2023-11-13T06:04:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-25T22:58:16.273-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Virtual Worlds</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp4YRQkR124WVtRaOS_HU_dfhgzy3UkrmbXFOlcHNW0Lz0t0Hk-DJokLHW0DVulqW5q0_9MoTbeFKJvWmvOkwc1a56g-dfiWK1eL3cAlh2qgaTsTRVebpUmjbHa7CmtwtjztBh3oErt4Udo4z95S8NrgHNHNfAUs9tn_LXM-Kpjl8odwUFBweu/s480/gd_uncle_sam.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; data-original-height=&quot;480&quot; data-original-width=&quot;479&quot; src=&quot;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp4YRQkR124WVtRaOS_HU_dfhgzy3UkrmbXFOlcHNW0Lz0t0Hk-DJokLHW0DVulqW5q0_9MoTbeFKJvWmvOkwc1a56g-dfiWK1eL3cAlh2qgaTsTRVebpUmjbHa7CmtwtjztBh3oErt4Udo4z95S8NrgHNHNfAUs9tn_LXM-Kpjl8odwUFBweu/s16000/gd_uncle_sam.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;You &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/from-princeton-back-to-portland-96e9cd655669&quot;&gt;may remember&lt;/a&gt; my &lt;a href=&quot;https://grunch.net/synergetics/usaos2.html&quot;&gt;virtualization model&lt;/a&gt;, inspired by my first encounter with an IBM mainframe. My account thereon emulated that of a mainframe operator. I had the resources of a whole computer, in virtual form, and could mount things, manage a file system, putter about in my cloud computer. That was in 1977, and here I am in 2023 enjoying much the same experience, with the toyz and I evolving together ever since we conjoined, or since I became a part of the cloud and/or internet, another host, another client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, post Princeton (Class of 1980), I got into the World Game simulation more, via the workshops (in Oregon, and in San Diego at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grunch.net/synergetics/geni1.html&quot;&gt;the 1995 GENI Centennial&lt;/a&gt;) and by meeting Chuck Dingee, one of the workshop instructors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grunch.net/synergetics/kiyoshi.html&quot;&gt;Kiyoshi Kuromiya&lt;/a&gt; drove me to Medard Gabel&#39;s WG headquarters in Philadelphia. This was the group that used a gymnasium-sized version of the Fuller Projection to stage a World Game experience for participants, involving role playing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting these threads together, I see the tidy set of flags representing the United Nations, each decorating a console and/or control room, a kind of mission control, where the object on the big screen, what the monitors all monitor, is Planet Earth, the homeland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a picture frame around the Big Blue Dot, with a national flag bottom center, attached to the frame. The insignia belongs to the control panel. Every nationality shares the same game board. &quot;This is your Israel, your promised land...&quot; &quot;This is all your Republic of South Africa, your promised land...&quot; &quot;This is all your United States, your promised land...&quot; Most of which is an ocean. One island in one ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does creating a new point of view always entail adding a new flag to the UN set? Not at all. IBM had (and has) a worldview. A given individual, a world game player, is free to walk from one control room to another, seeing the same Planet Earth through a large number of viewpoint windows. Israel&#39;s is a whole world view, Palestine&#39;s another, even if the latter is a virtual viewport with a diaspora for its citizenry, in the eyes of other nations. Universities might be able to step in with additional documentation permitting travel, if the nation-states don&#39;t feel up to it (more science fiction).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wandering from room to room&quot; doesn&#39;t have to mean physical travel, as we&#39;re talking headspaces mostly. In looking for communities that could use development and creatives, I&#39;m seeking to open possibilities for refugees more generally. Each refugee family gets a menu of Asylum City projects, none of which in principle need be seen as dead end assignments without any possibility of return, should returning be in the cards (Bikini and Marshall Islanders are always wondering which atolls will still burn them alive).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In gaining hypothetical Palestinian citizenship in a diaspora nation, I&#39;m still not necessarily freed from my penitentiary camp or compound by my UN prison guards. I&#39;m perhaps imprisoned because I was forcibly displaced (or my grandparents were), but now that I want to leave my camp voluntarily, I&#39;m told I can&#39;t be forced to leave, only to forced stay, by the international lawyers. If I try to force my way out, I&#39;ll be hunted, like an escaped slave in the pre Civil War US south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;trust but verify&quot; approach adopted in negotiations around WMDs entails a lot of mutual surveillance, which parties may try to squirm out of, perhaps by exiting various treaties. &quot;If I stop spying on you, then I can rightfully stop you from spying on me&quot; might be the internal monologue, not always honest. Given parties to the original agreements may have considered them &quot;for the ages&quot; (long lasting), there&#39;s some inertia and some continuation of surveillance nonetheless, even to a point of some new regime taking over such that the exited treaties might be restored and renewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lead up to the 2nd attack on Iraq, post Desert Storm (now CNN&#39;s &quot;shock and awe&quot; campaign) I was always talking up surveillance as the way to nail down the results of any weapons purge, post the United Nations inspection program headed by UN inspector Scott Ritter. I published my little memos to Usenet, about all the webcams we&#39;d be needing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m all for giving civilians the freedom to explore the benefits of nukes (including medical), where the danger of adding further weaponry is clearly a downside, not always factored in by the lobbyists, or even hyped as a net positive to the true believers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of a Chinese delegation coming to San Francisco, a theme of &quot;life in our urban centers&quot; is gathering steam (ramping up) on social media. How much will that city do to clean itself up before the Chinese cameras arrive, feeding millions of eyeballs with news about how the US is doing? Its regular folks, not its celebrated media personalities. Do other countries have this level of substance abuse? What experimental social policies are being tried?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citizens of a US mindset are likewise tuning in news from other states. Sometimes the enlightened approach is not to punish and criminalize but to invent new lifestyle possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;Along those lines (homelessness, drug abuse, suicide...) is Germany really the basket case people say it is, ever since a pro-Ukrainian group sabotaged its infrastructure? I bet today&#39;s Germany would feel pretty normal to me, although it&#39;s been decades since I wandered the forest trails of Bavaria, or toured the industrial cities of Hamburg and  Cologne.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I remember going through Checkpoint Charlie in our tour bus, back into East Berlin, where our train had stopped, coming from Scandinavia. Today, there&#39;s no more wall. Yet some states are building new walls. To what extent does the concept of citizenship require fences to make sense?&lt;p&gt;The tacit competition World Game sought to invoke was towards higher living standards, meaning likewise in an ethical sense, contrary to stereotypes. Living like a billionaire philanthropist is not all about creature comforts, the pandering to which shortens lifespans according to science. Most billionaires work out, realizing they&#39;re fortunate to be weighty (financially) and wanting to maximize the length of their lifetime scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes play to win but when genuinely in the spirit of the game, they&#39;re able to empathize and celebrate the victories of teams other than their own, based on quality of play, although fortune (luck) does play a role (per quantum mechanics (a type of thermodynamics)).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High ranking military officers will cultivate this same empathy because it helps them think more like the enemy in some cases. Sometimes both sides sense political leaders have made this mess, and their clash is more a crash, like a train wreck. Such militaries feel abused. Tulsi Gabbard spoke up for them, although she&#39;s not a pacifist and carries a predictable level of antipathy towards Muslims, such as we&#39;ve learned to expect from India&#39;s Hindus, influential among Samoans apparently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tend to side with peace-loving civilians against those wishing to settle scores with outward violence, so I cheer when civilians manage to escape war zones and get on with their lives, perhaps returning to rebuild if and when order is restored. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-about-narnia.html&quot;&gt;Narnia kids&lt;/a&gt; got to do this, spending their childhoods in an alternative reality. The imagination provides a last resort form of escapism.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The martial arts are about controlling emotions and not rushing into reckless actions without thinking through consequences. Politicians without martial arts training may find their authority undermined, by mystery cults such as Mithraism. Military people start thinking alike, even across enemy boundaries, about the incompetence of a certain political class. This state of affairs doesn&#39;t always result in a coup or regime change, as those lacking imagination might suppose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A military may act in good conscience to defend a people, but if destruction engineering is the best answer (rubblizing the fruits of civilized living), with humans unwittingly caught in the crossfire (like on 9-11), then management failure higher in the chain of command is simply presumed, as a tautology.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design science needs to be given a real chance first, and a lot of the time, that just doesn&#39;t happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Letting civilians leave was an aspect of the conflicts both in Syria and Ukraine, and in Yugoslavia before that. Noncombatants had some humanitarian corridors to get out through. Convoys of buses arrived. You could elect to stay or go, amidst family pressures. If your nearest and dearest are all leaving, you might as well go too, unless your calling is to stay and fight some oppressor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, refugees fleeing devastation through Libya do not get supportive bus convoys or flotillas, operated by the many states. The navies and coast guards in question tend to criminalize migrating humans, finding them to be undocumented and therefore unworthy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mediterranean is only partially organized around letting people merry-go-round on cruise and/or ferry ship tours, as if with Eurail passes. Folks in retirement phase, spending savings, or families working jobs at home, on a vacation, get to joy ride. Emigres get to walk or swim. Refugees get treated as outcasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stateless humans suffer punishment by those enjoying statehood of some kind. The conquest of the planet by the prison states (states that act like prisons, keeping their peoples behind border fences, yet permeable to elites) is the story of recent chapters. The states hope to build more walls wherever they can gain a foothold as the ultimate public authorities, which is still an uphill battle for a lot of them, including in the federated states of North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That brings me to a concluding thought, which continues a thread raised by TrimTabbers on our last call. We were discussing Fuller&#39;s search, chronicled in his &lt;i&gt;Ideas and Integrities&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;(1963), for candidate college majors that might be used to unify the subdividing PhD specialties i.e. which majors might stay comprehensivist and polymathic? You need big picture thinkers, per &lt;i&gt;Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth&lt;/i&gt; (1969).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He comes up with architecture as a main one, suggesting military logistics had been his own ticket to this mindset, but that this offering was now in retreat.&amp;nbsp; Architects might be molded into a type of social engineer who&#39;d actually be integrated to in decision-making and planning circuits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the TrimTabbers: &quot;so who is listening to such social engineers today and do we even have any worth listening to?&quot; Good question. I&#39;d say many fancy themselves to be in such positions, even without &quot;social engineer&quot; on their business cards. From that point, our discussion moved (somewhat predictably I&#39;d suggest) to Fuller&#39;s failure (a common topic) to persuade us that relative Utopia was really a choice beyond a fateful Oblivion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do not yet celebrate a shared comprehensivist viewpoint at this point, nor employ many polymaths, and we&#39;re therefore obviously going to hell. That seems closer to the consensus reality (CR) than than the Bucky buzz, which still heralds humanity&#39;s success, along with desovereignization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s right: Bucky disciples are not uniformly optimistic or upbeat given world trends. My &lt;a href=&quot;https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/poor-slob-bucky-psb.html&quot;&gt;main quibble&lt;/a&gt; with their conclusion is I regard Fuller to have personally been a success, in objective terms, given all his honorary degrees and stellar awards. Choosing oblivion would be more our failure than his. He did what he could. We don&#39;t get to use a double standard. Maybe judge your own performance first, before seeming to preside (serve as president) over others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, from a flag wavy Uncle Sam informed viewpoint, I&#39;m still in the game. My Uncle Sam (US) is a skeleton, Grateful Dead inspired, with additional iconography on the way, mixing in more baseball and other sports.

It&#39;d be another forty years before gambling on US bonds was seen as tantamount to providing Grunch with its own risk capital, to spend in elective showdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;i&gt;Grunch of Giants&lt;/i&gt;, required reading among the Bucky disciples, to sample the flavor of World Game globalism way back then. I set up a domain and Wordpress site (&lt;a href=&quot;https://grunch.net&quot;&gt;grunch.net&lt;/a&gt;) to further memorialize this history and to further explore the ramifications of his contributions, including his receiving a Medal of Freedom in the Reagan Era (a fact most high school texts still tend to suppress, especially the USA&#39;s public ones -- another sign of Grunch&#39;s dominance).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3272446880202600347'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/3272446880202600347'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/11/virtual-worlds.html' title='Virtual Worlds'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjp4YRQkR124WVtRaOS_HU_dfhgzy3UkrmbXFOlcHNW0Lz0t0Hk-DJokLHW0DVulqW5q0_9MoTbeFKJvWmvOkwc1a56g-dfiWK1eL3cAlh2qgaTsTRVebpUmjbHa7CmtwtjztBh3oErt4Udo4z95S8NrgHNHNfAUs9tn_LXM-Kpjl8odwUFBweu/s72-c/gd_uncle_sam.jpg" height="72" width="72"/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-5692527690853494762</id><published>2023-11-08T16:59:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2023-11-12T10:32:07.988-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Real World BizMos</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;My science fiction around the business mobiles, the fleets, their responsibilities, is still future tense. However all the priors are in place, meaning crewed RVs have their fanbases, via YouTube and Patreon. A mom and pop RV team will ply the highways and byways of North America (stereotypically), with both high praise and damning testimony, vs-a-vs what may well be a challenging (but worth it?) lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was just watching such a team today, giving us the big picture: a couple hits the road, starts a fanbase, starts merchandising, and gets addicted to the sponsorships that start coming with the territory. If your channel has high viewer numbers, you&#39;re gold to those wishing product placement. And I&#39;m totally down with this myself i.e. looking back, my bizmo teams were indeed going to weight and rate products, although I&#39;m not saying always on request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my own Youtube channel, for example, I&#39;ll extol products, and yet I don&#39;t check the box saying there&#39;s a paid sponsorship involved, because there isn&#39;t. I&#39;m capable of extolling products of my own volition, and do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, the couple continues, the grass starts to look greener in some other pasture. Veteran fans, who&#39;ve enjoyed the BizMo Based Lifestyle (BBL) themselves, as hosts of their own channels, are now ready to retire to some alternative way of life. They continue as a cohort, representing those transitioning &quot;from&quot; instead of &quot;to&quot;. Hey, that&#39;s a life chapter too.&amp;nbsp; Having been a One Band One Roader for some decades, it&#39;s time for that remote home that doesn&#39;t move so much (even if you still do).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I anticipated a lot of these technologies in my science fiction: Kickstart; YouTube; hypertext in general. These special case instances were answers to generic prayers. Prayers, as prophecies (per Thomas Paine), as dreams of the future, needn&#39;t be that specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5692527690853494762'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/5692527690853494762'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/11/real-world-bizmos.html' title='Real World BizMos'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-10416211.post-1350319542213408574</id><published>2023-11-03T14:42:00.007-07:00</published><updated>2023-11-08T16:44:01.636-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Where&#39;s the Magic?</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Could it be that we intuitively understand, after decades of immersion in special effects science fiction, that we&#39;re ready for a next level?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see whole cities built and left largely empty in China, in part because skilled people need something to do. That&#39;s why we have militaries too, to stay occupied and in shape. But in shape for what? Are we talking about livingry or killingry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we in any shape to build &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/07/epcot-west.html&quot;&gt;new EPCOTs&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s an arcane way of asking the question, but not off target, as the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow had a modicum of &lt;a href=&quot;https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/02/maga.html&quot;&gt;LAWCAP support&lt;/a&gt;, meaning lawyer-capitalism seemed it might be ready to take the &quot;theme park&quot; concept to the next level, and indeed that&#39;s what started to happen. But then the effort bogged down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who picked up the Disney baton, if WDC itself, post Walt, had to drop it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;ve heard talk of Google&#39;s plans for mini-cities. But big tech comes across as pretty hard edged and predatory compared even to The Mouse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big tech is always scheming to prove essential workers are not really needed. Where&#39;s the magic in that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The A in AI is for Artificial, which means Phony, Simulated, Unreal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AGI (artificial general intelligence) is a weak opening, conceptually, as it&#39;s oxymoronic, as we&#39;re to understand AGI, when and if, is no longer Phony, but the real deal. &quot;Humans, not really understanding their own capabilities, have now developed these abilities in their machines&quot; -- that seems to be the plot. But how coherent is that whole screenplay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be that humans are ready to implement more of what the design science revolution was promising, having faced up to their lack of integrity in so far failing to do so.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the ubiquitous nature of media-making equipment (for staging, for recording, for sharing), the &lt;a href=&quot;https://grunch.net/synergetics/gst1.html&quot;&gt;implementation phase&lt;/a&gt; will in fact be televised. So let&#39;s work on the scripts. Let&#39;s start with location scouting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will always need emergency shelter for people transitioning back to a more normal lifestyle, and one model is to bring the refugee camp to them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on geography, these could take the form of hospital ships, after a hurricane or tsunami for example. A smattering of hospital ships amidst a circulating convoy might be used to move millions over a period of some months. The system activates as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why not build an Asylum City for the express purpose of providing what military bases provide today: shelter for economic (and/or other) refugees, with opportunities for R&amp;amp;R.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guantanamo comes to mind. Should Cubans &lt;a href=&quot;https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/11/wheres-magic.html&quot;&gt;build an EPCOT&lt;/a&gt; where Gitmo used to be? Or should Gitmo be preserved as a museum?&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1350319542213408574'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/10416211/posts/default/1350319542213408574'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2023/11/wheres-magic.html' title='Where&#39;s the Magic?'/><author><name>Kirby Urner</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/12114860457655013242</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='https://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author></entry></feed>
