Quakers have a history of continuing to move west, or to Costa Rica, to escape the slave-owning militaristic yahoos that have dogged the Americas since its inception.\u00a0 The Quaker utopia envisioned for Pennsylvania never materialized.\n\nI think \"demanding\" a Quaker homeland is more a jokey way of saying we have a sense of independence and sovereignty too, as a Quaker Nation, and don't plan to always run or move away just because newcomer neighbors plan on being thoughtless blockheads in some way.\n\nWe look on the legacy left by the perpetrators of the Indian Wars (Andrew Jackson et al) with some skepticism.\u00a0 Louisiana Purchase?\u00a0 Yeah right.\u00a0 From Napoleon?\u00a0 Uh huh, sure.\n\nLets just say the United States is not entirely believable as an entity, despite all the theater, the role playing, given all the contradictions and how much we're asked to take on faith.\u00a0 As science fiction, however, it has ongoing potential as a plot driver.\u00a0 I've introduced [USA OS](http://grunch.net/synergetics/usaos.html) (operating system) as a meme in my writings.\n\nMom and I were yakking about the Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) in the car on the way over, having picked up olives on the way.\u00a0 There's a lot of anti-colonialist sentiment in Scotland as well.\n\nIt's just uncool to be tainted by the WMD brush and most nations would rather not sully their image by hosting such retro barbarisms.\u00a0\u00a0 The nuke nations form the Nuke Nation Ghetto of less morally developed, more delinquent nations.\u00a0 Scottish have national pride and want out of the ghetto.\u00a0 Who can blame them?\n\nScots provide safe harbor to WMDs (Trident submarines) because the UK / WDC / NATO forces them to do so, not because they think it's smart or the right thing to do.\n\nHearts and minds have been lost, leaving hollow institutions to strut and puff on the world stage, looking foolish, clown-like, but in an ugly, not-so-funny way.\u00a0 A farce in other words, neither persuasive nor convincing.\n\nThe people in the room tonight are all eager for humans to get to a next level in their evolution wherein their suicidal tendencies are less salient.\u00a0 Why tempt fate with such hubris?\u00a0 We've seen so many accidents already.\u00a0 Why is our drive for self preservation so disengaged?\n\nCurt, a retired neurosurgeon who worked with fish in a hospital setting, didn't have time to tell me if fish get as suicidal as humans do.\u00a0 I doubt it.\u00a0 The latter seem to specialize in taking stupid risks with the ecosystem and then paying for it later.\u00a0 Fish seem less maladapted no?\n\nSpeaking of maladapted, I came back to a $39 ticket on my windshield, because I simply forgot the City of Portland changed its policies awhile back and now runs parking meters on Sundays.\u00a0 It didn't used to be that way.\n\nI don't know why I slipped back in time like that.\u00a0 I need to get back to the future.\u00a0 I'll consider it a payment to city coffers earmarked for more refugee resettlement programs ([CUE used to help](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/03/afsc-and-ethnic-phobias.html) manage those contracts).\n\nThe Jewish story of evolution gives humanity a direction towards what's better:\u00a0 the Promised Land.\u00a0 The past, in contrast to the future, is a relative nightmare, a state of enslavement (metaphorically Pharaoh's Egypt, no disrespect to the Misr of today).\n\nIn heading towards the Light, towards Freedom (Liberty and Justice for all), towards a Peaceable Kingdom -- and away from the darkness of the 1900s -- Judaism and Quakerism steer together in positive synergy.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/20778477673/in/dateposted-public/)",
