  "content": "As it turns out, the weather was pretty normal, after the morning flurries.\u00a0 But we didn't know that would happen waking up.\u00a0 I woke up early, to an email from the auto mechanic very conveniently allowing me to reschedule.\u00a0 Sure, why not?\n\nI was up early because of time zones again.\u00a0 Not the first time.\u00a0 We in the on-line economy, when doing synchronous meetings, need to adjust for the global economy staying awake, somewhere, 24/7.\u00a0 This was a follow-up appointment, having established the only remaining glitches were client-side.\u00a0 This morning's meetup went off without a hitch.\n\nHowever, with snow coming down, the street already white, I wasn't about to rush out to have my door lock inspected.\u00a0 My car is a junker (meant affectionately, and not out of disrespect to a still strong engine) and shows wear and tear everywhere.\u00a0 Remember Columbo with Peter Falk?\u00a0 I think my car is nicer than his at least.\n\nI'll be getting back around to that soon though.\u00a0 To postpone owing to snow is not to neglect, at least not in Portland.\u00a0 We're allowed to take snow days.\u00a0 The district schools were all closed.\n\nI had an assignment in a district school yesterday.\u00a0 There's a lot bureaucratic going on, in addition to all the Python learning.\u00a0 I sent a note to the parents, reminding them of what we're doing around Codesters, an adaptation of the Python language that runs well in the browser.\u00a0 These are middle schoolers and I'm not expecting them to have the same wishes around how to spend time.\n\nDeke told me yesterday was Personal Chef Day, and that I am for my mom.\u00a0 She does a pretty routine diet, thanks to the \"food is medicine\" mantra, and her pills interact with all the rest of it.\u00a0 That makes the work easier.\u00a0 She's able to fend for herself to a point, if need be.\u00a0 And she'll want you to know:\u00a0 she's not the only one known to leave a burner on.\n\nHave I talked about Tulsi Gabbard yet?\u00a0 The candidate for US president.\u00a0 I remember:\u00a0 I started a draft on Medium, but don't regard it as pithy and [probably won't publish it](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/friendly-musings-on-national-politics-8e62f6d51006).\n\nIn general I think like an Atlantic Monthly of some months ago, that the job of POTUS has become too undoable, in terms of demands and responsibilities.\u00a0 As a consequence, I'm finding myself not wishing that office on anyone, as too cruel and unusual.\u00a0 Tulsi deserves better.\n\nAn emperor-president is too oxymoronic a notion, we've been finding that out more and more over time.\u00a0 The screenwriting just isn't believable.\u00a0 The illusions have worn too thin.\n\nPolitical bubbles have popped before.\u00a0 I'm not scapegoating here.\u00a0 No one president has brought about this state of affairs and indeed many of fought it, in ways we don't (and probably won't ever) know about.\n\nSpeaking of the job of POTUS, the scandal lights were flashing big time today as the public learned more about the personal wheelings and dealings of their chief executive, from his former lawyer.\n\nThe broad outlines of the story have been public for months.\u00a0 However, the full circus potential of the scandal had not been exploited, in the manner of the Kavanaugh hearings, until this morning.\u00a0 I was blissfully oblivious, until my daily briefing from one of my TV hound friends.\u00a0 I did some catching up later, having decided to stay put.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi1UyNMDbn970hiY93t9HceQw8rvYQ1CR49kI6nDGVw8ChekSGv3udEDvJAC77955p9mxg9GlR5zl0ORR6UFvvYyiWvOaNicyGh_YS9ZigLqkMA1OtsH03U_ZEP3mYn-ostHxT9/s1600/33368912418_c84650ec66.jpg)",
