  "content": "I was pleased to watch a goodly portion of [this Southern Methodist University professor's](http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/cycles-of-american-political-thought.html) lectures, on tap at the local library, Belmont branch.\u00a0 He builds in the thesis that the easy availability of space for expansion is integral within the American psyche, as he defines it.\u00a0 How much is that changing now?\n\nRather than give a facile answer, I do say we need to factor cyberspace into the picture.\u00a0 The fight for land and property was often to get a bigger soap box and command of push media such as radio and TV broadcasting networks.\u00a0 The way to have a voice heard was to emulate Hearst or someone equally powerful.\u00a0 Cyberspace lets the hoi polloi, me one of them, short cut around all that.\u00a0 We stand on the shoulders of giants.\n\nIn other words, I'm suggesting that Cyberia, which Americans ([Amerikanskis](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/amerikanski)) helped to pioneer is a factor, that this kind of space is still real.\u00a0 People wanted a place \"one mouse click away\", not buried behind a few fat cats, a few hogs.\u00a0 We're close to getting there.\u00a0 The URLs are turning our pyramids into local anomalies within the graph, blips on the radar, no long so overbearing or in the way of our having a voice as a people.",
