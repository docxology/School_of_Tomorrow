  "content": "I've been mounting an old soap box and calling for a recall of the PhD degree, a defective product.\u00a0 How could \"lovers of knowledge\" prop up such a corrupt academic establishment?\u00a0 Letting Pearson get away with not sharing our polyhedrons is a travesty.\u00a0 The UK is not our friend.\n\nLook at what happened in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0 A hoax puppet, made to seem smart, got to be a Saudi citizen and address the UN, making a mockery of the curriculum everywhere.\u00a0 Who needs [Yes Men ](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/02/yes-men-fix-world-movie-review.html)anymore, when supposedly bright people are this gullible?\n\nI take the high fear levels around AI, traceable to Terminator movies, as a projection of what we most fear:\u00a0 that our own conditioned reflexes, our robotic side, will end civilization.\u00a0 That's a real danger.\u00a0 We're 99% robot, with only 1% \"that of God\" (intuitively minded). Our robotic side is very useful in a pinch, but may also get us killed.\n\nThe real danger of AI is that we, the really intelligent (RI) will become dumber and dumber, turning into robots.\u00a0 The army of PhDs, so-called \"doctors of philosophy\" aren't fighting back it seems.\u00a0 They're surrendering to their own artificialness, turning phony to their cores.\u00a0 AI = PI (phony intelligence).\u00a0 It's everywhere.",
