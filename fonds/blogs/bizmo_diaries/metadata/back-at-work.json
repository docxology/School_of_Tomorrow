  "content": "I had full queues during the conference and the week prior, yet it felt a lot like a vacation, in the sense of so many experiences per minute, a kind of time dilation.\u00a0 We got a lot done.\u00a0 Having MySQL move to INNODB as the default engine is not a bad move, but the ripple effects were boat rocking in our little world.\u00a0 ENGINE = MYISAM solves the problem.\u00a0 The DBA track uses INNODB anyway.\n\nMy vector today was through Salt Lake City back to PDX.\u00a0 I dined at Beaches, choosing a Cesar Salad (small) and seafood chowder, both good.\u00a0 And IPA for a beverage, my standard.\n\nThe TSA folks were really professional in St. Louis.\u00a0 I had a badass knife in my satchel which I thought was maybe OK, given my ethnic craziness, black Stetson hat (\"gun club\"), Fettuccini Alfredo colored coat.\u00a0 The TSA pros are thinking WTF and offer I can check the knife instead.\u00a0 She escorts me out, but first I express regret at tossing the after shave (bought for $1) and they fish that out too.\u00a0 So polite and well trained.\u00a0 I checked the knife and came through again, a sweaty mess by this time, so I bought a T-shirt on sale at a concession and voila, good to go.\n\nOn board Delta, I finally discovered the WiFi had free stuff and started watching Maze Runner, but my battery ran out before we did much.\u00a0 Some poor dude got driven off, then Samsung tablet said good night.\u00a0 Great machine, no complaints.\n\nHilton was fantastic as well.\u00a0 Good job St. Louis with that white elephant post Train Age station, Union Station.\u00a0 Portland has a tiny one, still functional.\u00a0 Yours was a goliath.\u00a0 So why not turn it into a destination in its own right, with a DoubleTree by Hilton?\u00a0 Not a bad idea.\u00a0 Hard Rock Cafe and everything.\u00a0 I salute the city planners on this one.\u00a0 Bold.\n\nSpeaking of bold, City Museum is truly pioneering and I stand in awestruck silence, before diving back in.\u00a0 I made it down the multi-story slide (from 10th floor the 4th?) only once, whereas my co-workers, young and slim, scampered around the circuit at least thrice.\u00a0 I squeezed through one of the airplanes and went down a couple other slides, including that \"Monster\" one to the foyer.\n\nCities want to be proud and it hurts when the world sees one as off course.\u00a0 Baltimore is hurting.\u00a0 Her Mayor was on CBS this morning and spoke directly and with heart, in my view.\u00a0 I respect these great cities and what they're trying to do.\u00a0 Portland is one of them.\n\nI used TriMet back from the airport, the corollary of Metrolink in St. Louis.\u00a0 Both are highly professional operations.\u00a0 That doesn't mean I don't have critical thoughts from time to time.\u00a0 Being a fan of an institution doesn't mean being a mindless zombie.",
