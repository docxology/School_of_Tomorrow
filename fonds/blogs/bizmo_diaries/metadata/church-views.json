Was it like 800 lire?\u00a0 We're talking late 1960s, early 1970s here. We lived in the EUR, then Viale Parioli.\n\nSomething the tourists could do, ascend the dome. I thought the Roman Catholics were being pretty nice to let us do it. They were double nice for allowing us kids, unaccompanied (that's my recollection, ditto the museum, which I hear is far more crowded these days).\n\nPicture yourself in the wall of the dome itself and walking in a narrow curved hallway that also curved vertically.\u00a0\n\nYou are \"trapped\" (held, protected) inside the surface of a sphere (roughly) with the wall to your left (let us say) containing the vast insidedness of St. Peter's Cathedral, and with the wall to your right shielding you from the great outside, of sky, pigeons, Rome itself and out to the great cavern of heaven. Switch left and right if you like, by simply turning around.\n\nThe final staircase if I remember correctly was a tightly spiral and basically inside a column, architecturally, or at least it gave that impression.\u00a0\n\nObviously this pathway to the top was no afterthought. Thank you Michelangelo.",
