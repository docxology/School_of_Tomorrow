  "content": "The on-line course I'm taking asked us to build a circuit of two push button switches, both of which need to be pressed for the LED to come on.  The Arduino motherboard is used only to power the breadboard, very not fancy.\n\nNote that a yellow LED on the motherboard itself, distinct from the always-on power light (green), is flashing intermittently.  This would have to do with some earlier-loaded blinking light program, unrelated to the current project.  The Arduino does retain the last loaded program, even when powered down.",
