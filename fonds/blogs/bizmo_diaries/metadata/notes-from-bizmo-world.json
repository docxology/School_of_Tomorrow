  "content": "Wow, they're not kidding at Steemit, when they say keep track of your own damn password. A lotta geeks dismiss that one, knowing reset with verification is a possibility, meaning you can just reset the password once you have the victim's cell phone.\u00a0 Not so with this blockchainer.\u00a0 You don't have the password in memory, which is too long to remember, and you don't get to reset it if you forget it.\u00a0 You'll never access your account again, another waste of a great moniker.\n\nI was pdx4d.\u00a0 They generate the passwords for you.\u00a0 They look like bitcoin addresses.\u00a0 You're getting warmer.\u00a0 I did find where I'd backed up the Steemit address, having followed protocol.\n\nSteemit is but one of many social media the next geek generation has cooked up.\u00a0 You weren't expecting the world to stop with Facebook were you?\n\nI'm using Facebook, as it's not either/or, but as a columnist in Bizmo World, I'm expected to keep pushing to a next horizon.\u00a0 Have you signed on to Meat yet?\u00a0 Just kidding.\n\nLets make it real here and talk about malls.\u00a0 Sears Discount is suffering from low attendance, another reason to go in, great customer service.\u00a0 They had their two models of microwave ovens at really low prices, but with a Walmart right next door (next store), that wasn't saying much.\n\nI came in like a robot, checked the LG, had my measuring tape, ended up with the Oster, about the same price but more swoopy or something.\u00a0 Walmart had some other things I needed.\u00a0 Then Fubonn, the Asian supermarket complex.\u00a0 More ramen.\u00a0 Kimchi.\u00a0 Couldn't find the soy sauce, will solve it next time.\n\nPortland's 82nd Avenue, an Oregon State road, is our homage to freeway gentrification everywhere, except it's not the freeway, but the business route running north-south parallel to I-205, itself the business route branch-off of I-5, that goes through the center, branching to I-405 to the super-center.\n\nBy \"freeway gentrification\" I mean the strip mall culture of one-story restaurant franchises and assortment of big and little box stores, supplied by truck, the premier vehicle of the I-net, from a layer of warehouses around any hub city, especially those with ports.\u00a0 Portland has humble freight traffic, and that keeps us connected in a global economy.\n\nYou may be wondering what bizmo rig I'm driving through all these parking lots and you'd be right to be wondering, since a bizmo log or chronicle typically features such a vehicle, with its quirks and problems.\n\nInstead, I'm in a four-door Nissan from the late 1900s.\u00a0 Long time readers of these blogs may remember Razz, a Subaru, and Robin Blue even before that.\u00a0 Cars get proper names much as we give variable names to other features in a program, including actors, agents, whatever observables.\u00a0 Mars has a name.\n\nThe archetypal bizmo shimmers in the archetypal landscape, between the lines, as we're still busy constructing the lifestyle.\u00a0 T4P only came along recently.\u00a0 For now, I'm just blending in as one more noodle lover.\u00a0 The Oster is working great, and sensed by itself when the baked potato had released sufficient humidity.\u00a0 There's some real science going on in that appliance.\u00a0 No Instapot yet, thinking about it.\n\nFubonn is on 82nd, like the two Walmarts I saw (the one I went into is further south, in Clackamas, whereas the second came after the Entering Portland sign, me coming north).\u00a0 I go there more often, as it's closer and Walmart - Amazon might be my online supplier of delivered goods, where I'm not the one in the fossil fuel business.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have a work sponsor ready to heat more of my building so we've got a truck on the way on Monday.\u00a0 I'm not a new customer, having been at my current location since 1995 or thereabouts.\u00a0 Newly married with child.\u00a0 We used to call Montag but their customer list was acquired by another company.\n\nThe microwave just decided to blow one day, kinda like mom's knee (though the latter had more of an excuse). The Magic Chef gave up the magic, after over a decade of service I'm reckoning.\u00a0 My range is a Magic Chef too, avocado green like from the 1960s, came with the house.\u00a0\n\nThe antique stove fits with my overall decor, which is likewise vintage, lots of vinyl paneling.\u00a0 We had the wood paneling in the living room removed, along with the shag rug.\u00a0 Pine floors.\u00a0 Looks like a ski lodge where the wood takes some punishment.\n\nA skilled repair person could likely have identified a fried wire in the Costco-bought Magic Chef and made it good as new.\u00a0 Our consumer culture encourages us to replace, not repair, these small appliances, though there's more of an aftermarket for the bigger ones, like washers and dryers.\n\nI'm not the expert.\u00a0 I'm the consumer, and some consuming I did.\u00a0 Thanks to my knowing how to teach Python, I'm able to afford a building with replaceable and irreplaceable gadgets and doodads.\u00a0 Python and Martian Math as a combo.\u00a0 That's another popular dish.\u00a0 We're like a food cart, in a town of food pods (lots of competition).",
