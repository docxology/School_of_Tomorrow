Buckminster Fuller) and EJA (Ed Applewhite). The same core concentric hierarchy obtains, with a new rhombic triacontahedron added [of 7.5 tetravolumes](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/11/phone-meeting-notes.html). This RT shares some of its vertexes with the rhombic dodecahedron of 6 tetravolumes.\n\nThe \"4D\" doesn't refer either to a \"tesseract\" (i.e. hypercube) nor to \"3D + Time\" but was rather a commercial logo used by Buckminster Fuller, along with \"Dymaxion\".\u00a0 The \"4\" in \"4D\" drew attention to the tetrahedron's starring role.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30639898501/in/dateposted-public/)",
