I've got Orlando in my headlights these days, of course hoping for zero road kill (sometimes [weird stuff](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460651/) tries to cross the road in the dark around there).Some [New York Times editorial](http://select.nytimes.com/iht/2006/11/07/world/IHT-07politicus.html), Russian Maneuvers, American Incoherence by one John Vinocur, suggests Russia is the baddie again, trying to be soft on Iranian vaporware plus doing evil things around energy:Senator [John McCain](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/john_mccain/index.html?inline=nyt-per), a likely Republican presidential candidate in 2008, wanted America to boycott last summer's G-8 meeting in St. Petersburg because it legitimized Russia's course away from democracy and its threats to halt energy supplies to countries like Ukraine.Politicians need ways to strike manly poses I suppose, and I'm betting the Russians'll put up with it -- it's not like they're new to such fun and games.I bought some new shoes, laceless, checked off a few other \"to doozies\" (sounds like what [Simpsons' Flanders](http://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&hl=en&lr=&q=flanders+simpsons&btnG=Search) might do).Although I'd planned to move [Portland Knowledge Lab](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/portland-knowledge-lab.html), unless [liberated from pay wifi](http://www.metrofi.com/) by now, I didn't have time to do more than speak with management about the issue -- and pay another month.  I've got too much on my plate to undertake the hassle of relocating just now.",
