  "content": "This one gets deeper into the Bizmo meme, suggesting one of the hallmarks:  institutional wealth (as in the military, but then universities have their fleets of this and that).\n\nI'm not looking to privately own and maintain this one particular business mobile.\n\nRather, I would at least like to download some playlists and connect to work environments, to stay productive en situ.\n\nThis is a lifestyle I've been seeking to promulgate, knowing it won't work for me if it won't work for others, by definition.",
