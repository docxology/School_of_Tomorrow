  "content": "This documentary is a direct response to the award winning [Gasland by Josh Fox](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/11/gasland-movie-review.html).\n\nI recommend viewing it.\n\n[Phelim McAleer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2697567?ref_=tt_ov_dr) did a lot of homework, starting with Kickstarter.\n\nThe director engages in a point by point refutation of the Josh Fox documentary.\n\nI notice there's a Gasland 2 out by now.\u00a0 I haven't seen it yet.\n\nI'm all for public debate about public policy.\n\nThe MSM comes in for some severe criticism in this film as well, especially the NYT.",
