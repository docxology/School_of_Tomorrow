In fact, my upcoming tutorial is on TensorFlow, with which I'm a white belt.\u00a0 I've been working out over in scikit-learn and feel ready to set foot in this Dojo.\n\nThe school was originally established to teach calculus, spinning off from Dr. Jerry Uhl's operation, University of Illinois. However that turned out to be a rather esoteric business in the midwest and the dream of California induced a morphification into the new code school, with calculus still in the picture, and indeed a whole university.\u00a0 However establishing a new ee-dee-yu (edu) from scratch is way harder than creating a dot com.\u00a0 Try creating a new dot gov for a sense of what it's like.\u00a0 Speaking of which, O'Reilly did inspire memes in government.\u00a0 I went to a GOSCON right here in Portland in fact.\u00a0 You'll still find Ignite Syllabus and such, based on our Lightning Talk format.\n\nI joined the school after all this change was well under way.\u00a0 Although I never got to meet Jerry Uhl, I felt initiated into the world of Champaign-Urbana, home office for Wolfram, with which the school had at first been intimately connected (during the calculus chapter, with Mathematica the workout bench).\n\nMy registration came with a bus pass.\u00a0 I live in Portland, so this is one of the conferences I hope to get to, as a way of upgrading / updating my state of the art.\u00a0 Pycon was here for two years, a blessing as well.\u00a0 Pycon roves around whereas OSCON moves far less frequently, in terms of venue.\u00a0 In the meantime, Portland has been changing a lot itself, becoming more a jewel of the Pacific Rim. We have a cable car now, an overhead tram.\u00a0 Compared to the ones in Switzerland, its trajectory is approximately horizontal.\u00a0 However that's still a legitimate use of the technology.\u00a0 We have a hospital complex on the upper end.\u00a0 Portland is about health care, as well as free software (free as in freedom).\n\nSpeaking of Pycon, I shared [the headline news](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/07/headline-news.html) in my other blog about the transition in power within the PSF, the intellectual property owner for Python and its trademarks.\u00a0\u00a0 Guido announced he was taking a vacation from his role as BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life), deliberately creating a power vacuum.\u00a0 He's feeling pretty confidant about the future of the Python language and wants to spark more creative ferment in governance.\u00a0 Dictators rarely have an exit strategy.\u00a0 We're grateful to Guido for having one (part of his being benevolent).\u00a0 He's not giving up being influential.\u00a0 He has the juice, or what we Quakers call \"weightiness\" (a metaphysical attribute not connected to literal poundage).",
