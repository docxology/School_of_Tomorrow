  "content": "Checks for deposit to my business need to be made out to the business, or to my late wife, for whom the business is named (it was hers). Sometimes I get sloppy and try transferring from a personal account with a check made out to me, for deposit in DWA.  Doesn't work, bank algorithms block that. Really OK, as I just rewrite it to DWA instead, which is easy. I did that recently, netting a $30 penalty from OnPoint, which saw both checks (including the one UBank rejected). Upon clearing up what happened, I was credited back the penalty. Lesson:  I need to not be so stupid.",
