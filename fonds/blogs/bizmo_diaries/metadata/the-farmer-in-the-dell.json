Games of Life may be played [that way too](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/life.html), and are, quite a lot.\n\nCould our Volume be as if filled with [rhombic dodecahedra](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/07/of-kepler-and-aristotle.html), perhaps using Quadrays again? \n\nThese vistas stretch out before us, which speaks well for the simple ladder that got us up this high, where we get [lots of overview](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/08/stem-carbon-as-theme.html).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/18315135184/in/album-72157654417641521/)",
