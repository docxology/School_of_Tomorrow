  "content": "I'm eating my own dog food with the codepen.io, doing some of the most basic pens, based on Youtubes, some of which are quite good. \u00a0Making a green box slide back and forth with some button interaction, is all doable in this interesting environment.\n\nMy two students will get some overview about how it all fits together. \u00a0Here's what I have in Movement:\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/33146648244/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nYes, JavaScript (ES, JS), a moving target of a language. A front line. I'm impressed by the many troopers who march into Angular, React and all that. The tutorials look fun. \u00a0Yet I'm still busy boning up on Python. \u00a0JS is back burner for me, so not the front end developer in that sense.\n\n\"Eating my own dogfood\" is a geek expression which, loosely translated, means walking one's talk.

Perl started it with the Camel, and then O'Reilly gave us the animal books.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/4983761251/in/photolist-MP4Ywj-cMa2Uw-cAM8rq-aT6F7g-aaWwo8-9vsnsw-8UZgi5-8NY4WR-8Bj1vP-8Ap5A8-PjcHU)",
