  "content": "Atlantic Monthly not long ago shared an argument that the DC idea of a \"president\" is broken.\u00a0 The same magazine likes to share PR for what I call the \"B2 Party\", which is behind the B2 bomber and its forays.\u00a0 Atlantic Monthly likes to shill for the B2 Party sometimes.\n\nAm I saying every major weapons system deserves its own party?\u00a0 Something like that.\u00a0 The names \"Democrat\" and \"Republican\" have outlived their usefulness.\u00a0 We have Beltway Bandits and... ?\u00a0 Oh yeah, Wall Street.\u00a0 Political discourse would make so much more sense if we could get our analysis more in those terms, versus always reading about zombies (DNC and GOP).\n\nA lot of Americans are really into war porn and crave it.\u00a0 Stroking the weapons, making them shiny, glistening, on camera is a part of it.\u00a0 We're taught this is an OK perversion, and indeed we're encouraged, as viewer voyeurs, to get sick in the head in this way, between shopping trips.\u00a0 Shop, then go home and bliss out on B2s, is the reduced instruction set.\u00a0 Many of us comply.\n\nLets combine the fact that the presidency is a joke (an undoable job, mostly a scapegoat position, designed for soaking up blame), with the fact that the war porn is a kind of mental illness (DSM anyone?).\u00a0 No wonder a lot of folks are casting about for a more meaningful discourse.\u00a0 Intuitively, they understand the political diet they're being fed is pretty hopeless.\n\nHowever, getting a weak ghost of a government to do the bidding of war profiteers is pretty easy.\u00a0 Just harness its lingering claims to legitimacy and piggy-back on its PR values, and you have a decent chance of getting a war going.\u00a0 That's the big payoff and many are working overtime on it, doing their best to build tensions with \"America's enemies\" (not seeing themselves as the ultimate killers of a once proud sovereign state).",
