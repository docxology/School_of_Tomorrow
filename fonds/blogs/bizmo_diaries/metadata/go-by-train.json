Didn't Michael Moore help lay that notion to rest in his latest movie, which mom and I both want to see (I've seen the previews)?\u00a0 \n\nUSers are among the more backward, culturally, adding them all up and dividing, to get an average. They have \"diversity issues\" in the sense of insufficient schooling in dealing with it intelligently.\u00a0 Remember the people who came here were those with the most trouble fitting in (like the Quakers).\n\nI'm teaching class tonight, really more like hosting a talk radio show, with me doing most the talking.\u00a0 My listeners text message, and see each others texts.\u00a0 I work their questions into my discourse.\u00a0 I'm doing a highly technical talk on Python, the computer language, which I get to teach in forty hours.\n\nLast night I was at the code school again, \"the guild\" as we call it, catching up with my peers and ignoring DC politics.\u00a0 Oregonians live on the Pacific Rim and tend to not always share East Coast perspectives.\u00a0 I brought along my XO-1 for show and tell. \n\nCarol has a speaking engagement elsewhere tonight, which I won't make.\u00a0 She's in demand as a speaker, and this year she took it on the road, riding shot gun with Ellen Thomas in rented vans, from LA to Seattle, and from Boston to Cape Code and Boston.\u00a0 Most 87-year-olds wouldn't have the stamina.\n\nThen she joined me for her granddaughter's graduation, in Richmond, Indiana, flying to Dayton from Reagan International, before packing her stuff to base herself here.\u00a0 Like the Pope, she has winter and summer residences.\n\n[\u00a0](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/29989347082/in/dateposted-public/)\nCharles Coss\u00e9 with OLPC XO",
