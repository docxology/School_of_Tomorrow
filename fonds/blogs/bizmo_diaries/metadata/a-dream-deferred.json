  "content": "# \n\nYou\u2019re\n probably thinking of a lot of frustrating delays, and of MLK\u2019s \u201cI have a\n dream\u201d speech. If you don\u2019t know about MLK, you likely won\u2019t recognize \nRBF either, though most will know JFK and USSR.\n\nHowever,\n I\u2019m thinking of a delay you may not be: the postponement of \u201csmart\u201d \nhouses (I\u2019m putting off a definition). Instead, the Big Promise has been\n \u201cdriverless cars\u201d (aka \u201cpeople movers\u201d if you lived through the 1970s).\n\nThe autonomous vehicle fantasies have eclipsed the next generation of Florida mobile home.\n\nIf\n a hurricane hits, Uncle Sam might have a FEMA trailer for you, but \nR&D halted on better shelter technologies, except in the area of \nhigh end camping (an outdoor sport).\n\nYou\n may be wondering when \u201csmart houses\u201d were ever a dominant fantasy, in \nwhich case I\u2019ll point you first to the DDU (Dymaxion Deployment Unit), \nadmittedly obscure, and then to the first true Dymaxion House, which \nhung from a utility mast but didn\u2019t sway in the wind.\n\n[More on Medium](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/a-dream-deferred-166c521d31c8)\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhvj6pdsZaAZtFe21dlYw7CS3EGs-EUOyKQCR-efpShEmYi4fLxbitarrxJg4bc0xb2Ej9oMJuDbZstjR11l0P3uNOy1Yh0EM9BjfWTiy18b3Hk9AXjjgEZB7ex1FYsFu7aP7Da/s1600/39792999623_0c6153e620_z.jpg)",
