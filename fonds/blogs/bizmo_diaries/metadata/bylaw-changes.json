  "content": "A rather open secret among Friends is that it's an uphill battle to keep the American Friends Service Committee in their good graces.\u00a0 You'd think, with the 100th anniversary of the Nobel Prize coming up, that Quaker churches and meetings would be crowding into the frame.\u00a0 Twas the AFSC that accepted, [on behalf of Quakerdom more generally](http://www.quaker.org.uk/1947-nobel-peace-prize).\n\nHowever, the political landscape has changed since those days leading up to World War Two, about which I recommend the book [Human Smoke](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/10/some-quaker-overview.html) (on my Kindle).\u00a0 That flash of early brilliance and optimism was nearly drowned in the wars to follow, in Vietnam especially, where the AFSC kept showing up in Hanoi, maybe on the same airport bus as [Jane Fonda](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/12/american-dad-plot-synopsis.html).\u00a0 That alienated a political demographic that overlaps with Christendom certainly.\u00a0 The Vietnam War had many elements of a crusade, especially if you see it [as Diem did](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/05/murder-mystery.html), a devout Catholic.\n\nConsider the late Bayard Rustin,\u00a0 [his 100th birthday](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/03/remembering-baryard-rustin.html) the focus of a recent Corporation meeting.\u00a0 US President Obama subsequently awarded him a posthumous Medal of Freedom.\u00a0 A lot of the [same people](http://www.trevorloudon.com/2007/01/red-stars-over-washington/) who love to hate [Hanoi Jane](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/05/murder-mystery.html) have no time for [our hero Rustin](http://www.trevorloudon.com/2013/08/obama-awards-presidential-medal-of-freedom-to-bayard-rustin-a-socialist/) either.\n\nOur Corporation bylaws currently stipulate that at least two reps from each represented Yearly Meeting be Corporation members.\u00a0 This governance relationship, between Yearly Meetings and the AFSC, which includes \"at large\" as well as geographic members, is strained to the breaking point, with the logistics of reaching a quorum proving daunting, [well neigh impossible](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/03/afsc-governance.html) sometimes.\n\nTo address this shortfall, the Corporation feels it must adapt by streamlining.\u00a0 Instead of stipulating \"no less than two\" reps from any Meeting, it will be \"no more than two\".\u00a0 The status quo will become the norm, whereas it had been our Achilles Heel.\u00a0 The AFSC will continue operating with the proper bona fides, as truly a Quaker organization, and the peanut gallery can just stay unfilled (the balcony seats are never needed for Corporation meetings as it is).\n\nI played devil's advocate during the conference call with Friends Center this morning, in my role as convener for my region's reps, our Yearly Meeting being North Pacific YM (NPYM).\n\nThe clerk congratulated me on [my performance](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/03/quaker-mens-group-2013.html) but one could sense our seeing a way open, the way of shrinking, like Alice.\u00a0 There's that tendency to stampede towards the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nA streamlined AFSC will be cozier, more tightly knit, goes the theory.\u00a0 Those who do share a commitment, will more likely get more done, divested of the more lukewarm hangers on, the foot draggers, the grumblers.\n\nI pointed out that because we're still hammering out what's considered legal representation in cyberspace, the day may soon come when reps need not travel to be legally present in meetings, thereby constituting a quorum.\u00a0 Where are the laws with that today?\n\nSo why worry so much about our \"carbon footprint\" when we might be on the brink of another upgrade?\u00a0 Might we address our shortfall in numbers another way?\n\nIf our goal is truly to maximize diversity (another bylaw change) then isn't cutting back our numbers a move away from that goal?\n\nWhy not pack the house, in virtual space, in augmentation of the physical meeting, and demonstrate greater diversity at the same time?\n\nWe'll see what happens.\u00a0 These discussions will be ongoing for some time.\n\nThe board takes a look at it again, before kicking it back to us for a red or green light.\u00a0 At least we've found a way to be open about our shortfall and the legal bind that has put us in.\n\nIf we have no way of living up to our existing bylaws, then it's not surprising we feel compelled to change them.\u00a0 We have to go with the army -- inward weapons only -- we've got.\n\nOn with the metaphysics then! -- or whatever \"[organizational alchemy](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/12/quaker-infrastructure.html)\" is called.",
