  "content": "My arc in the Youtube stash as been towards integrating Synergetics into the philosophical literature. I've been announcing this as my project for some time, however announcing is not the same as doing, so inevitably, if into walking my talk, I'd have to do some walking. I hope my accounts come across as fleet footed and not overly pedestrian.\"Target acquisition\" has ironic meaning if depicted as someone getting a target (e.g. \"kick me\") posted on his back. One may appear to purposely enter the crosshairs of others, trained to shoot at specific signs, by disguising oneself, on purpose, to get their attention.\u00a0 In taking Harold Bloom on board, in my latest Youtube, has the School of Tomorrow painted itself into a corner?My wiring diagram is pretty simple:\u00a0 extend New England Transcendentalism through No More Secondhand God to Synergetics and its \"geometry of nature\". Technology is hers.\u00a0 Automation is hers. Humans flail about in their Earthly Kindergarten, yet we see have gained traction, to the point of bearing some responsibility for the biosphere as a whole.\u00a0 We are the Borgosphere already.Back to Harold Bloom, he presages Jordan Peterson in bemoaning a turn of events within University, where ideological currents now run counter to his tastes.\u00a0 Taste, like smell to Nietzsche, means a lot to opinionated scholars.\u00a0 Dr. Bloom makes it clear that for him it's all [about time management](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/4dsolutions/School_of_Tomorrow/blob/master/Scheduling.ipynb).\u00a0 You have only so many hours to read, so why waste your time with not the best?\u00a0 That's a compelling argument, unless maybe you're doing anthropology or natural language analysis.\u00a0 Perhaps you're into observing, or seeking, some operational dialectic, Marxian or otherwise.\u00a0 \"Whence this 'taste'?\" in other words.Indeed, I've used the A where PATH crosses STEAM, to mean Anthropology, not Art, because I'm willing to subsume Art.\u00a0 That's my heresy, shall we say.\u00a0 Philosophy, as practiced by Wittgenstein, is in many dimensions turning the arts of Anthropology upon one's own matrix (subculture), thereby setting up some recursive vertigo in some disciples.Back to Bucky, we need to remember one of his working assumptions was nationalism, a new kid on the block to begin with, would certainly morph in the face of jet travel and globally embracing telecommunications. He lived from the 1800s to the dawn of the internet, and was already fully into hypertext when he died.\u00a0 Remember Dr. Vannevar Bush [anticipated search engines in the 1940s](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/).\u00a0 Technology expresses through us, the invisible hand moving us, inclining us, by means of invisible chessboards, using pieces the ranks of which we scarcely guess.In other words, Bucky was looking for signs of demise, among sovereignties, in the very concept of sovereignty.\u00a0 When nation A carpet bombs nation B, that's an obvious sign of no sovereignty, i.e. that's not a relationship among coequal kingdoms, free to make their own alliances.\u00a0\u00a0The nations haven't really gelled, given the disrespect of sovereignty we have all witnessed.\u00a0 Furthermore, the USA had proved itself incapable of passing an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) for women.\u00a0 Those of us getting The Graduate Review (for esties), saw Dr. Fuller's essay foretelling the USA's demise as a likely consequence. By the 1980s, the Grunch had completed its \"tunnels under Disneyworld\" takeover, per Fuller's Grunch of Giants\u00a0subversive narrative.",
