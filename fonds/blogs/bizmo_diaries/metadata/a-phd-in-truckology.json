  "content": "Of course truckology is not a real discipline, though you wouldn't know that visiting my Uncle Howard's place.\u00a0 One could swear a truckologist worked here.\n\nThen there's routing the trucks, assigning them lanes, a software-intensive endeavor.\n\nI met a master craftsman in that business and know a PhD in Truckology, were Teamsters U to have one, would be [no joke](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/10/onward-urners-et-al.html) and command a good income.\n\nI'd been thinking Harvard Business School might work on scholarships for truckers already plying the Tehran to Istanbul highways, on westward into Europe and eastward to Kabul, the old spice routes, newly paved.\n\nIt'd be a treat to drive that, were it safe enough, but for now the academic credit is due to those currently braving these wilds.\n\nMaking it safer, recruiting more students, would be the hard work of some dean.",
