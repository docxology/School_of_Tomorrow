Highways and byways.\u00a0 Upon those, the trucks ride.\u00a0 As do trains with engines on rail.\u00a0 So the apples to apples might be: train engines to trucks.\u00a0 Both diesel in many cases.\n\nAs a kid, I preferred rails to roads because of the added requirement for such things as switches, and switching yards.\u00a0 Trains brought their own set of challenges.\u00a0 Round houses.\u00a0 Trucks had (have) their rectangular warehouses, sometimes solar paneled.\n\nThe forklifts run around inside, or even autonomous vehicles, routed to take stuff from here to there.\u00a0 Switch around among trucks, go multi-modal to trains.\u00a0 Truck and train actually work very much on the same team.\u00a0 Both truck trailers (with wheels), and shipping containers (without wheels, stackable), are multi-modal, with an overlapping spectrum of modes.\n\nIn adult life, I began to think more about the trucking infrastructure, a prominent feature of the North American economy.\u00a0 I'm no expert on trade agreements or substance control.\u00a0 My focus has been university developed exchange programs whereby driver crews gain experience on routes usually considered to be beyond their scope.\n\nThink \"[Peace Corps for truckers](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/truckers-without-borders-b260b133063e)\" but don't feel you have to thrust it into the State Department as some official government program.\u00a0 We're giving analogies, not stating identities.\u00a0 That being said, I could imagine the existing Peace Corps adding \"trucking\" to its categories, or maybe it's there already, I wouldn't know.\n\nI did not serve in the Peace Corps however our family sometimes met with, even offered hospitality to, Peace Corps volunteers in the field.\u00a0 \"Volunteer\" doesn't mean \"unpaid\" so much as \"not conscripted\" as joining the Peace Corps is not some obligatory form of public service, as serving in the military used to be for US citizens.\u00a0 We were US citizens living outside the US in places where Peace Corps people often work, such as the Philippines (but not in Bhutan).\n\nHowever, my focus on trucking lately hasn't taken me entirely away from trains.\u00a0 The different ways to use a rail system other than for \"high speed\" go through my storyboarding.\u00a0 Roads and tracks are not that different anyway, in terms of needing to obey constraints on grade.\u00a0 Both steepness and curvature are considerations, though rail and road follow different constants.\u00a0 Trucks turn very sharply compared to trains, which need a relatively huge radius to accomplish the same turn.\n\nImagine your university dorm and classroom is a four train car affair, and as rather button down.\u00a0 Is this Princeton?\u00a0 The keg party folks charter a different service, not that we can't serve regional beers, or whatever's local.\u00a0 You're studying the region you're going through, learning the language, history, tastes.\u00a0 You're getting academic credit -- as a lot of those truckers are -- from your time on the rails, often intentionally side-lined without an engine, per plan and schedule.\n\nHooked to all this is the idea of the Personal Workspace (PWS).\u00a0 Trains might not always carry sleepers.\u00a0 Most do not.\u00a0 They could be modeled with offices, work and study spaces.\u00a0 Ping pong tables make sense when you're parked.\n\nThe North American riding public in large degree switched to jets in order to minimize travel times over long distances.\u00a0 Commuter hops were and are train and bus oriented.\u00a0 Some American cities have invested lots in rail, Philadelphia especially.\u00a0 Others rely almost exclusively on the \"rubber\" tire.\n\nOne might also experiment with trains that facilitate hopping on and off.\u00a0 The moving sidewalk platform has been proposed, and used by Disney with some success.\u00a0 The train slows to run at the same speed as the mounting belt and the passenger simply steps on or off the train.\u00a0 Slower belts (moving sidewalks) run parallel and after a few transfers, the passenger is back to standing stationary at the station (why we call it that).",
