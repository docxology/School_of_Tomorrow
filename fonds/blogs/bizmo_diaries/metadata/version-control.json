  "content": "More from EuroPython day 2:Open source projects depend on version control repositories, which allow projects to evolve in an organized manner, meaning in a tree shape, with a trunk and branches.Right now I'm sitting in a talk about [Bazaar](http://bazaar-vcs.org/) with [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/).  Bazaar is named for [gun nut](http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/guns/) Eric Raymond's [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/), a classic essay within the [free software movement](http://www.gnu.org/home.html).Geeks I interviewed seem to rank Bazaar more highly than [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/), Subversion more highly than [CVS](http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/).  [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/) may be even better than Baazar.Earlier I attended some open space discussions: of Pygame (games projected), of possibly organizing a business conference ([eGenix](http://www.egenix.com/)).I mostly just listened, while writing descriptions for, and uploading, five Pythonic mathcasts to [Showmedo](http://www.showmedo.com/).  The wireless hotspots here are quite fast, thanks to Aist\u0117, so the video files uploaded quickly.OK, time for some [lightning talks](http://www.unessa.net/en/hoyci/2007/07/europython-2007/) in Alpha.  Amazing stuff:  [LOLPython](http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2007/06/01/lolpython.html), web serving [from a mobile phone](https://mymobilesite.net/) (Nokia) running Apache & py_mod.  [Chandler](http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/WebHome).  Zope3 (Zope instances are dead). [z3c.ormJS](http://demo.carduner.net/). PyCon UK.  [Enso](http://www.humanized.com/products/). EGEE grid.Python 3000:  Guido encourages developers to use the upcoming Python 2.6 and a new source code conversion tool to begin developing [3.0](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=208549) versions of the code, starting with excellent unit tests.",
