  "content": "We respect \"jobs\" and \"work\" enough to pay people to do them, but think \n\"study\" -- as in \"work-study\" -- is not work and therefore it's no one's\n job to get educated. Make studying paid work, and you've solved a lot \nof problems.\n\nFrom current studies:\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/40753905863/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nMy small campus tests should \nteach us a lot.  We could have a cash-like crypto and credits in the \nmore academic sense, which nevertheless have currency-like attributes.\u00a0\n\nCould be that when you join the camp (which is not a prison camp) you \nput your usual wallet (with any outside currency), charge cards and \nphone in a secure locker.  The camp cellphone will come pre-equipped \nwith your wallet and apps.\u00a0\n\nWhen you leave the camp in about three weeks\n (average stay for this facility) you'll get your stuff back while \nreturning the camp gear (you probably get to keep some samples though \ni.e. a \"swag bag\" -- product placement is part of the business model).",
