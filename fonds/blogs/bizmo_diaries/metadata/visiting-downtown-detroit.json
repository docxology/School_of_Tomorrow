  "content": "Although I had only a few hours in Detroit, I was eager to get a sense of its historical trajectory.\u00a0 That a great city has many square miles of now uninhabitable structures is not really a surprise, as North Americans did not always build with the intention their structures last hundreds of years.\n\nHuge swaths of urban acreage all across the industrialized east are well past their pull date.\u00a0 You'll see this in Baltimore and from any train window in the northeast corridor.\u00a0 I don't see this as an apocalyptic crisis, more just physics at work.\u00a0 Rust never sleeps as they say.\u00a0 Decay happens.\n\nThat being said, it's ironic that \"the big three\" (Motor City's car companies) colluded with government to wipe out city rail systems and pave over everything, to insure the motor car's monopolistic dominance of the landscape for almost a century.\n\nNow that we've burned through over half the fossil fuel, the costs of maintaining all that infrastructure have become prohibitive and North Americans are fighting a losing battle against pot holes and shrubbery poking through pavement.\u00a0 I'm glad our Mazda 2 had robust suspension as we bumped our way through the decaying streets (and broken parking meters) of downtown Detroit.\n\nI mention parking meters because that first one, Friday morning, ate two quarters but gave zero time, so I moved to another one that ate two quarters for 30 minutes credit, but gave no credit for the third or fourth quarter.\u00a0 Tara tried a dime.\u00a0 No dice.\u00a0 We were out of change.\u00a0 I came back to find a $45 parking ticket on my windshield.\n\nDowntown Detroit is indeed blessed with these decaying empty gigantic buildings.\u00a0 Some may be restored or are being restored, but others just need to come down, or stand there as tourist attractions for people like me.\n\nWhile on the topic, I told Tara my belief was the Twin Towers of NYC were built with a self destruct system as a prerequisite for anything that huge needing to come down someday, not because of any tragic catastrophe but because all buildings have a half-life.\u00a0 Ditto Building 7.\u00a0 Now that [David Chandler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bfyd2W7zYQ) is a member of Multnomah Meeting, we're likely to have more such conversations back in Portland.\n\nWe also stumbled across a protest, against the brutal persecution of Christians in the Middle Eastern war zone, where the British drew some lines many political world maps still show to this day (not Fuller's).\u00a0 Violence against ethnic groups is not a new phenomenon and North America swelled in population precisely because humans were fleeing persecution in the more populated areas of the eastern hemisphere.\n\nOnce humans were crowded together in America, that same ethnic violence arose.\u00a0 Humans have a violent and ugly past and present.\u00a0 I'm not especially proud of this species.\u00a0 I understand why many religions consider us a \"fallen\" experiment (as in \"failed\").\u00a0 The angels mock us with good reason.\n\nDetroit does have a bit of a rail system they call a People Mover and there's a futuristic station downtown amidst all the urban decay, providing a stark contrast between the new millennium's early days, and the one gone by.",
