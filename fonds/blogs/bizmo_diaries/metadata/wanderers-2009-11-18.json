[Then I posted to Math Forum](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=6906490&tstart=0).  Then I hoofed it to Wanderers for an in depth look at the Mandelbrot Set, running Java.  Bill Shepard is hosting.David Tver is here, then maybe a first timer.  I'm in and out of the meeting room, attending to [2nd world business](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/07/2nd-life-2nd-world.html).  Glenn Stockton, Jim Buxton...We could produce this fractals segment for any teacher with a projector.  Having students take turns zooming in needn't be a mind-numbing activity provided some of the lore is woven in.  This is the Argand Plane after all, integral within academe since oh, a long time ago.  No excuse to be boring.  We could do this at Cleveland, Grant... Winterhaven.In my spoof skit of this session, we zoom in on the small happy village where Waldo lives in the woodwork, munching on fractal PB&J.So John Gilbrough helped Bill write this fractal explorer (which ran great on my Ubuntu Starling I'm happy to say -- in no rush for Karmic Koala).  That's the same guy who did [the rotating polyhedra in stereo](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/10/full-tilt.html), via Java and GWT (Google Web Toolkit).Four of us went to Pepino's afterward, immersed ourselves in Martian Math talk a little.  I need to send out some links.Thanks to Sean for this link to [a BBC program](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20031204.shtml) on Wittgenstein and his philo.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcHxm6_vZ9pz5DQOpbbsBNoQLqMP2aBxJiaTBLCOTDeQu9YU0u4NRlW7b7U4CYLsshwTZOR9aNLZThyHSU-VSEpKK-vMOxa6IMd71Fpg4oWW9a60qh8sDyiPSlEkNXkPcMs23v/s1600/wittrs.png)<< [download here](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/DownloadDoc.aspx?doc_id=12900876) >>[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEimWk71USae9AXeWG7FN4iWQHmFkQ8B1In300GiqJ9X95ojnybQhIaJMRIUogHPvy3PRDTdER9j7H_nkWxjAfltIUL75Z-yW6t2ZXb6PtwkFd7qLx9_PNtV-94dKYMiLTjXxDBV/s1600/wittrs2.png)<< [download here](http://www.docstoc.com/docs/DownloadDoc.aspx?doc_id=12904854) >>",
