  "content": "Yes, today's high frame rate video games -- a different challenge than rendering (used in hidef cartoons) -- if T-rated, may well contain violence far above what I recall CBS decrying back in the early days of rasterized V-games.However, if meant to stay a cartoon, wrapped in a sports ethic, forbidding of animal cruelty, then we keep the psychological elements we associate with pro ball, other high stakes sports.We like and willingly pay for this drama, and tolerate the trade off between risk and sports injury to our egos.  Even less physical injury occurs among geeks, unless we count thumb sprains.As an alternative to war, I think violent video games do have a bright future.  Hence the bumper sticker:  Quakers play Quake.",
