Hood Community College (MHCC) should get more credit.\u00a0 The overlap in staff and faculty has had a precessional effect.\u00a0 The other night, a few of us visited the campus planetarium for a teach in on galaxies, an event open to the public.\u00a0 Got a tour of the lab / offices.\u00a0 Impressive I thought.\n\nThe Thai restaurant, [Vi Thai](http://www.yelp.com/biz/vi-thai-restaurant-wood-village) in Gresham, Wood Village exit, up the hill a ways, was excellent.\u00a0 Just saying \"Thai restaurant\" into the Android (Steve fakes an American accent) got the robot voice telling us where to go.\u00a0 Electronics have made it easy.\u00a0 \"Where's my car?\" doesn't work yet though, when you get lost in a shopping center (or community college).\n\nI quizzed [Bob Mcgown](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/12/tale-of-two-parties.html) on the difference between [graphite and graphene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_carbon#Graphene).\u00a0 Was the latter another allotrope of carbon, like [buckyballs](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/eja1.html) and diamond?\u00a0 This got us talking about the trail of evidence Harold Kroto followed to [a Nobel Prize](http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1996/) with Richard Smalley and Robert Curl.\u00a0 On the spur of the moment, we surfed up [his web site](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/1523) and emailed a greeting (with [a snapshot](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/8616232077/in/photostream), so like a postcard).\u00a0 I'd met Harold a long time ago, at the First International Conference on Buckminsterfullerene, in Santa Barbara (by [Pergamon Press](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pergamon-Press/107884822574035)), where I represented both [BFI](http://www.bfi.org/) and [ISEPP](http://isepp.org/) (I was BFI's first volunteer webmaster).\n\nSo many eating options along Hawthorne means less business for any one of them, maybe (unless total foot traffic increases, or the willingness to eat out).\u00a0 Such traffic patterns were on Becky's mind when last we stopped in.\n\nSwirl is not competition for Fujin, but it was for Ben & Jerry's in her analysis, yogurt being trendy, and would the new owner of the ice cream shop there keep making things stay interesting?\u00a0 Free cone day is coming right up, we saw that on the sign after, drawn in by the singers out front.\n\nSpeaking of Unilever, I heard the theory lately that [PonPonPon](http://youtu.be/yzC4hFK5P3g) has an overabundance of Unilever products represented, some kind of [conspiracy](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/diversity-training.html)?\u00a0 Count me a skeptic so far.\u00a0 I've gone over it and don't recognize any ice cream containers. \n\nLast night, in private studio, we went over some South Park and related productions:\u00a0 history [of white people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nus9BZlAfQ) in America, [of Mormons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gm6JYFdnD8), and a [famous musical number](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEaKX9YYHiQ).\u00a0 The public threads (journalism, blogs etc.) seemed to do less to educate about Mormonism than I thought they would, given Romney's candidacy.\n\nOpinion \n\nI don't think the Roman Catholic church should strive to be other than a patriarchy.\u00a0 That's what it is and changing the rules too drastically would change the character of the practice to such a degree as to render it a different animal.\n\nI have no problem with patriarchies persisting, any more than I have a problem, in principle, with a religion that reserves its core positions for females only (however defined -- XX a clear place to start, but not necessarily where all do).\u00a0 Nor must all religions use gender-based criteria -- but those that do should be permitted to do so.\n\nThe premise here is your freedom to choose:\u00a0 religions are brands.\u00a0 You also have the freedom to create new ones, and some will be better than any so far InshaAllah.\nFor warm up last night, we goofed off watching [Maru](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uDuls5TyNE)\u00a0 (\u307e\u308b\u3067\u3059) the clever cat.\u00a0 I closed out the show with [Code Guardian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjkcwA8Bk34) by Mark Spitoni and company, a kind of tribute to a genre of war movie and popular with my Saturday Academy classes.\n\nWe talked about Hawaii a lot.\u00a0 Pat is moving there to be with her mother.\u00a0 This is her last Wanderers meeting in awhile.\u00a0 She'll be at the next ISEPP lecture (like TED talks, but longer).\n\nEmail from Python Software Foundation: \n\nYou have voted and your vote has been registered. Thank you!\u00a0 Here is your ballot....A copy is also attached.\n\nPlease keep it to verify the integrity of the election.\nWe have secret ballot elections for new fellows, board of directors etc., even though we also claim to be a dictatorship when we feel like it.\u00a0 Guido has thumbs up thumbs down on PEPs, plus he's free to take the language in new directions.\u00a0 We got a taste of his leadership during [his Pycon keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOQLVm0-8Yg) this March.\u00a0 I also enjoyed [Raymond Hettinger's keynote](http://pyvideo.org/video/1669/keynote-3) and have offered to summarize it for our school.",
