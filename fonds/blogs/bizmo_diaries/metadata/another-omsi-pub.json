Unless you're trying to make it funny. \u00a0There's some tough screening if so.\n\nRichard Louv sings a lot of the same spirituals we do around Portland, he was clear about that.\u00a0 He hadn't lectured in quite this setting before:\u00a0 so much booze (the event is held in a brew pub).\u00a0 Being not from around here, he's maybe not quite so relaxed.\n\n\"What is nature?\" is actually a good question, as to think vast cities are not natural is to be a little bit crazy, I have to say.\u00a0 But that's OK.\n\nRichard sounded quite apologetic for his profession's being so invested in pessimism and despair sometimes.\u00a0 He was speaking of journalism.\u00a0 The message he wanted to deliver was there's still hope -- something along those lines.",
