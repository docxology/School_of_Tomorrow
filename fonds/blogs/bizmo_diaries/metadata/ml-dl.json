  "content": "We use these short little acronym in government (Cyberia) all the time.\u00a0 ML = Machine Learning.\u00a0 DL = Deep Learning.\u00a0 If you don't know what these mean, you're likely a left-behind politician with too little time for engineering to really govern (steer).\n\nAs a newbie in the circle of ML / DL teachers, I'm very humble.\u00a0 I sit at the feet of favorite teachers and sponge it up, tasking my own neural net to re-weight and re-bias as necessary.\u00a0 Get to the bottom of all these meanings.\u00a0 Investigate.\u00a0 Don't assume, coming in, that your namespace is well-tempered (well-tuned).\n\nMy approach is two-track.\u00a0 First, I've somewhat abandoned doing everything in Sphinx, not because I have any issues with Sphinx, but because of my own weaknesses and shortcomings with regard to Github.\u00a0 There's a final step wherein documentation might \"go live\" in world-readable (open source) space, but I'm not taking it.\u00a0 Second, I'm staying with Python.\n\nTrack One:\u00a0 manual skills, like when gardening, you need to know how to use a spade, trowel, shovel, bucket, weed whacker and so on.\u00a0\n\nTrack Two:\u00a0 conceptual grasp.\u00a0 The latter comes slowly or at least at its own rate, less under conscious control, whereas practicing with matplotlib, numpy, pandas and scikit-learn APIs is eminently doable of one's own volition.\n\nMy focus is on polishing Track One manual skills and remaining patient with the \"slow dawning\" that is the gradual emergence (surfacing) of any knowledge domain.\u00a0 I can't rush Track Two whereas if I burn the candle at both ends, I can practice the way athletes practice:\u00a0 you keep at it.\n\nKeeping these tracks separate has one big advantage:\u00a0 I don't have to apologize for taking the ten thousand foot view and going for broke on Track Two, all out of proportion to what my manual skills yet allow.\u00a0 I'm barely able to dig a trench yet am already studying the intricacies of orchid raising, or beekeeping (not usually considered part of gardening, but then really everything is).\n\nMy humility does not translate into refraining from actually studying the magic.\u00a0 I just have to admit I haven't practiced enough, nor re-tuned my model enough, to fully minimize the error function (cost function).\u00a0 I'm still getting to the bottom of ML DL (gradient descent).",
