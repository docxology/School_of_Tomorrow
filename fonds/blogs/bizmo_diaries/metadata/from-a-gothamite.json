  "content": "\"Gotham\" is supposed to be \"any city\" as you know, but there's that \"Goth\" right in the name, and the Dark Knight might be portrayed as a goth comic in some ways (yes, I'm referring to Batman, see post below).\u00a0 But then \"Gotham\" fades into \"metropolis\" as in \"metropolitan\" which tends to mean any concentrated urban area, a CBD (central business district) especially.\n\nThe word \"business\" is fun as it contains \"[bus](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/09/djangocon-day-two.html)\" as in Magic School Bus, or that bus on a motherboard that conveys data, perhaps in parallel.\u00a0 In the urban center, things get \"bussy\" (pertaining to buses and business).\n\nI'm in such a place now, one of those open inventory caverns, air conditioned, where people flock to take goods, to each according to her charge card allowance.\u00a0 I conveyed a shopper here, from the bank, not by bus but by motorcar, in the 4-wheeler sedan I've called \"maxi taxi\" or \"torture taxi\" depending on mood and lighting.\u00a0 She's [an older Nissan](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=17157315%40N00&q=taxi&m=text), the [successor to Razz](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=17157315@N00&q=Razz), the raspberry colored Subaru.\n\nLloyd Center Mall:\u00a0 I've [posted from here before](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/09/across-from-blue-nile.html).\u00a0 Back then, I was being cynical about the wifi and the nickle & dime me approach.\u00a0 [Nixon](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/history-is-surreal.html):\u00a0 America's answer to communism.\n\nHey, I'll give [a pro-capitalism speech](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html) why not?\u00a0 First, let me explain how I tend to use the word \"capitalism\", even as I struggle to bring it back to everyman's way.\u00a0 I think in terms of capitals, i.e. major cities, or mover and shaker places, hubs, key players.\n\nLike when they say \"London believes\" in some propositions, as if cities could have beliefs.\n\n\"Portland agrees with Tehran\" on [some issues](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/WittrsEX/message/4863).\u00a0 Phrases like that bespeak \"capitalism\".\n\nAnother meaning is \"[using one's head](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/07/coffee-shop-capitalism.html)\" as in \"thinking cap\" as in \"being one's own boss in the 'what I think' department\".\n\nI'm in a vast (OK, big) mall, and people just help themselves to goodies.\u00a0 Yes, they have to pay for them, sometimes (often) on credit.\u00a0 But it's a layaway economy that one designs for oneself.\u00a0 There's latitude for self expression.\u00a0 You prefer [the Ikea look](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/at-ikea.html)?\u00a0 That's fine.\n\nThere's a sense of choosing for oneself on a level it makes sense to offer choice, rather than a sense of having a thing meted out, preferentially awarded based on impossible criteria.\n\nIn a relative distopia, you'll never get that pair of shoes, because you're not allowed to just pay for them.\n\nIn a fixed price (same price for all), catalog-based economy, you don't have to do it for favors or quid pro quo.\n\nYou do it because you put your time and energy in, in some other way, in some faraway land.\n\nYou are not beholden.\n\nYou walk away from the merchant, goods in hand, not owing that merchant.\u00a0\u00a0 Now it's between you and Visa, and that's how you want it to be.\u00a0 There's just a lot less karma, or lets say freedom to create your own karma.\u00a0 It's back to Alaska or whatever, to one's own adventure's, not some state's, though you may be a state's agent.\n\nThat being said, I came here, used the free wifi, and moved on.\u00a0 My intent was consumerist though: I was thinking to upgrade the phone, from this hand me down first generation Android.\u00a0 But this branch of Verizon doesn't stock HTC 1x, just Incredible and Rezound, so it's out the door and off to a blogging place.\n\nMy shopper is shopping.\u00a0 She doesn't always get to be in such a large metropolis, with its many charms and wonders.\u00a0 Bridge Pedal was today.\u00a0 I stayed home and caught up on some studies.\u00a0 I also am reconnecting with Free Geek thanks again to [Holden Web / Open Bastion](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/02/open-secrets.html), a great web of connections.",
