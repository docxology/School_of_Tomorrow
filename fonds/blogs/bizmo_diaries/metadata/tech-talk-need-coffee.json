  "content": "I like that Wikipedia helped propagate the term \"disambiguation\" as indeed we have a need to disambiguated a lot of the time. From all the press given \"machine learning\", if you have that wired up with \"AGI\" (artificial general intelligence), you may be thinking we're on the brink of the Singularity.\u00a0 Or you may think more as I do, that a radio hasn't a chance of inventing radio, no matter how sireny the songs.\n\nThe science fiction world we each live in, really matters, to each one. But as a fish to water, so we are, to this ocean of ours.\u00a0 Expressing it is nigh impossible in some ways.\u00a0 That sense of a bubble with limits is still valid, however much we've turned to foams (cite Sloterdijk).\n\nPerhaps your world features immanent AI takeover of human affairs.\u00a0 Or maybe it features old people suckering for expensive \"we'll upload your intelligence\" schemes.\u00a0 We've seen all these plots in the movies.\u00a0 I'm not suggesting either world is original in the sense of widely unshared.\n\nI'm back to a full teaching load and want to give my Youtubes more time to just sit there and undergo fusion, or fission, or whatever metaphor.\u00a0 Translation:\u00a0 I'm not making one today.\u00a0 I've been on a roll lately, churning them out.\n\nAm I positing a mental process out in rackspace somewhere?\u00a0 Not exactly.\n\nI'm suggesting more stochastic energy patterns, thanks to random search engine activity, with researchers wanting to track down some supposed factoid.\n\nThat there's a stash of Youtubes on all that \"Bucky stuff\" already out there becomes known, whether watched or not.\u00a0 Nor is mine the only stash.\n\nIn my science fiction, we feature \"grid talk\" a lot, which includes appreciating California's commitment to open source (peer review).\n\nOnce a secretive security state thinks it's in charge, and responsible for covering up all hint of scandal, we've lost public oversight of a public utility.\u00a0 The open source liberal arts were not about altruism first and foremost, so much as omni-triangulation and integrity.\n\nYou don't want to put all your eggs in a no-bottom or weak-bottom basket.\n\nI've been going over some of the Youtubes about the prospects for AGI in the future.\u00a0 What I look for is honesty about where we're at today i.e. I have little patience for hush hush \"secret labs\".\n\nRegardless of where you stand on whether electronic circuitry might support consciousness, implicit endorsement of deliberately misleading science fiction doesn't look good in the rear view mirror.",
