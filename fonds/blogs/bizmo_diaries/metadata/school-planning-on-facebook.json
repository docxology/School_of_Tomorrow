This was after I brought up the generic idea of charter networks latching on to at least some of the New England / New Scotland (Nova Scotia) stuff, transcendentalism if you will.\u00a0 Alexander Graham Bell and family were the New Scotland residents. His interests had turned to aeronautics after the big invention for which he was most known: the telephone.\n\nYou may have seen me on Youtube in my obscure (esoteric) channel, telling the story of Bell and his kites, based on this book I'm reading, having mined it for pictures.\u00a0 Bucky Fuller is mentioned throughout, as another genius who came upon the same discovery by a different route.\u00a0 I'm talking about [the octet-truss ](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/STEM%20Mathematics.ipynb)of course.\u00a0 What charters teach that?\n\nNot that one needs a charter or that you have no right to experiment even if you've been stereotyped as a \"traditional\" school.\n\nFriday, I was out of my usual ruts in North Portland, finally visiting the latest digs used by Saturday Academy, by now the thirty five year old institution.\u00a0 You'll find [I go way back](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/search?q=%22Saturday+Academy%22) regarding Saturday Academy in these blogs.\u00a0 We talked about Martian Math some more.\u00a0 I showed up with what's left of those cardboard polyhedrons made by Russell Chu and Trevor Blake and myself.\u00a0 Some of those didn't survive to the end of 2017. Plus I took some C6XTY to the meeting.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/5436831548/in/photolist-wWKQmk-bdBsk4-a3doND-9mY873-9hrbAY-8awzCS-7Fw23Z-7dcs4X-6BY6va-6oqjem-6i5oRw-5SXuYP-5PjRWV-5AA1JF-5xe2b6-5sHnxN-5rFY8v-2yoZR2)\n\nWhere we stand today in Python World, is Visual Python, a flagship spatial geometry add-on, is starting to work well with Jupyter Notebooks, a core technology in my virtual classroom.\u00a0 We might be able to give high and middle school age students some experience with these tools.\u00a0 [The Martian Math stuff](http://www.4dsolutions.net/satacad/martianmath/toc.html) is very polyhedron focused.\n\nC6XTY consists of plastic soccer-ball like spheres held in a semi-rigid lattice per the octet-truss arrangement, ditto Alexander Graham Bell's design for kites, towers, other structures.\u00a0 Is it that he didn't patent the thing?\u00a0 One might think that Fuller's gaining a patent on it later might have necessitated bringing their contributions together, and making Bell's work known to Fuller.\u00a0 Apparently these connections got made only later.\n\nWill a \"super school\" teach me anything about A, B, T, E and S modules?\u00a0 In this flavor of spatial geometry, we employ the octet-truss as our home base conceptual scaffolding, not the XYZ all-cubes lattice of Descartes and Fermat.\u00a0 It's not like we can't use both.\u00a0 Indeed, in converting between the unit volume of the \"IVM\" (the octet-truss skeleton) and the unit volume of the XYZ coordinate system, we encounter S3, a specific scale factor, or \"currency converter\".\n\nQuakers (Friends) have their history as school makers.\u00a0 Schools have to be more than brick and mortar buildings, a physical campus, to survive the exigencies of time.\u00a0 They need \"schools of thought\" to inhabit them, give them life.\u00a0 What ghosts might we attract over time?\u00a0 What frequencies?\u00a0 Obviously, I'm reaching back to reach forward.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/38925811861/in/dateposted-public/)",
