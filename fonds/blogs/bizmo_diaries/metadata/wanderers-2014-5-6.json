  "content": "We were a small group at the Linus Pauling House this evening.\u00a0\n\nI was all gaga for Big History, having just rented the three DVD set at Movie Madness.\u00a0 I'm only through the first four episodes, in the order of salt, horses, gold, cold, I think in that order, as guiding principles of human history.\u00a0\n\nVery phase rule, very Euler in showing those topological networks in its cutaways about \"connecting the dots\".\u00a0\n\nAll rather breathless and swoopy, just right for a jaded audience used to fast cuts.\u00a0\n\nGood use of repetition, not wasting good shots by showing them just once.\u00a0 Repeating in different patterns.\u00a0 I appreciate the technique.\u00a0 Yay History Channel.\n\nBut of course the conversation roamed through a lot more than just that.\u00a0 In Open Forum, we meander like crazy.\n\nGlenn has had his eye on that building at the base of Hawthorne, next to the School of Rock.\u00a0 He thought the story in the Business insert in the Portland Tribune, the issue with the full page goat on the cover page, about NewsBeat breaking into the news biz, was resonant with his plans for studios and editing rooms.\u00a0 I mentioned the same building to AFSC as one of my hats as an Area Committee member is to scout out possible locations, if only to inspire our imaginations to higher heights.\n\nMore soon.",
