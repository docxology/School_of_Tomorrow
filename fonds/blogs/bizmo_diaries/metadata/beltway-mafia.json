  "content": "We're used to \"Beltway Bandits\" as a journalistic cliche, referring to the ring road around Washington, DC, which is lined with DC's favorite contractors, such as Unisys, Honeywell, and Booz Allen Hamilton.\u00a0 However \"bandits\" may not be obvious enough in some circles.\u00a0 Too cartoony.\u00a0 How about the \"Beltway Mafia\" instead?\n\nThe Beltway Mafia is heavily into matters military and needs to keep the flow of weaponry going.\u00a0 The front keeps shifting, from Iraq, to Afghanistan, to Ukraine.\u00a0 The goal is not to fight these countries, but to arm them against their foreign enemies and their internal insurgents.\u00a0 That's called the protection racket, which the Mafia is good at playing.\u00a0 Accept our protection, or else.\n\nUkraine is especially dependent on the Beltway Mafia for operational support, while the BM is in turn dependent on the US (Uncle Sam).\u00a0 The defense of Ukraine against its internal and external enemies is a high priority of these subcultural icons.\n\nSome Ukrainians at first may have wanted peace with mother Russia, another homeland for many of them.\u00a0 The Beltway Mafia put an end to those pipe dreams early on. A new raison d'\u00eatre had been found.\u00a0 A goldmine.\u00a0 The new big business inside the beltway would be to \"fight to the last Ukrainian\".",
