PAW we call it.\u00a0 Clever.\u00a0 Tigers...\n\nThe cover story of the June 6 issue features Olga Russakovsky, a professor looking at the issue of bias in Machine Learning.\u00a0 If those gathering the data were racists (believed in races), chances are the machines will find those patterns all over again, thanks to the labeling.\n\nThe article Why America Stumbles... on page 19, seemed an example of how bias equals inertia.\u00a0 Rick Barton looks at Syria, but not from an existential point of view.\u00a0 \"Does Syria exist?\" is not in question, even though its sovereignty is violated daily.\n\n\"Does the USA exist?\" would be another question to ask, regarding this post Constitutional Banana Republic that took upon itself to bomb Syria recently, with great fanfare, in an effort to prove itself the Final Authority, complete with Nikki Haley's \"dead baby\" performance in the UN.\n\nFrom recent revelations about how Netanyahu of Israel (so-called) has been trying hard to start a war with Iran (Persia), the US (i.e. DC) complicit, we see that [a certain cabal](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/05/judgement-day.html) is eager to set that tinderbox called Mesopotamia alight, and by extension the world.\n\nApparently the feigned chemical weapons attack in Britain was intended as part of the same war plan.\u00a0 Get everyone hating the Russians, accuse Assad of chemical weapons use in April, and then go on the offensive, with the public eager for a big show.\u00a0 That almost happened.\n\nFortunately cooler heads prevailed.\u00a0 We know the hotheads are busily at work on their next subterfuge. \n\nAnnouncing the end of the Nation State Era has become an exercise in self and species preservation at this point.\u00a0 Clearly the puppet masters are eager to pull whatever strings they believe they have.\u00a0 Telling uncomfortable truths is better than sounding phony all the time.\n\nHowever Princeton Alumni Weekly is not prepared to be on the cutting edge, except insofar as its president reminds us on page 2 that universities often outlive nations.\u00a0 That much is true.\n\nSo do they read Grunch of Giants in the Woodrow Wilson School?\n\nI agree with Chelsea Manning's recent remark in Berlin, that we're all machine learners.\u00a0 We modify our existing belief systems in light of new data coming in -- or we don't.\u00a0 We're all implicitly Bayesians, with brains reprogrammable by mind.\n\nContinuing revelation is a reality, the most sobering reality we know.\n\nSometimes belief systems freeze up and become specimens in some World Game museum. PAW is like that in some ways.\u00a0 Stick to belief systems the alumni are comfortable with.\n\nIt's not that I expect the peoples of Spaceship Earth to spontaneously start up a new chapter by all gravitating to the same page all of a sudden.\u00a0 There's some eternal truth in that Tower of Babel myth.\u00a0 We never all had a chance to agree on those Nations in the first place.\n\nIt's just that it's a Small World After All, at the end of the day.\u00a0 Universities know that better than most sometimes.\u00a0 Congratulations to Maya Lin on the new installation.\u00a0 I look forward to visiting it, maybe for my fiftieth reunion in 2030?",
