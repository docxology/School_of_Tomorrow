  "content": "Having the FBI lady meet the USPO lady in a bar made a lot of sense as both the FBI and USPO are government pressure cookers where people of varied ethnic background are expected to get lots of work done, sometimes really difficult work.\u00a0 Ethnicity gets in the way sometimes, or makes for a diverse crackerjack team.\u00a0 It can tip both ways depending on the day, if the team is still bonding.\n\nThe \"team\" in this movie is a duo and spans a stereotype range in the night sky (of stars), roughly from Sandra Bullock to Rosie.\u00a0 A particular spectral band of womanhood post Wild West chapters, the gun toting still there, amped up even.\u00a0 Rosie has a fridge full of guns, which Sandra admires.\u00a0 No, I'm not making fun of the actresses by calling them by these wrong names.\u00a0 They are both hardworking and competent.\n\nThe nerdy girl complex targeted by the FBI closely matches the nerdy Osama tracker's in [Thirty Dark Zero](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/02/zero-dark-thirty-movie-review.html) [sic].\u00a0 The homework pays off, redeeming these strong readers from wallflower unpopularity.\u00a0 We spend a lot of time on the lonely lady's high school year book, speaking volumes about the \"to whom\" this movie is addressed.\u00a0 Rosie is from Jersey City where I probably taught her sister's niece or something.\u00a0 Just kidding.\u00a0 Any resemblance to non-fictitious people or places is purely coincidental (except we're allowed to say Boston).\u00a0 All my best to both characters in their policing careers.\u00a0 \n\nThe film is out-and-out comedy, tongue-in-cheek to the max.\u00a0 This helps offset the believability.\u00a0 Girls are being pushed by urban America into a life of fighting crime.\u00a0 That's what Americans do.\u00a0 We have good people and bad people and tourist attractions if you're just visiting.\u00a0 Not like we're imaginative or anything.\u00a0 And even if we're cops, we're free to abuse alcohol all we like.\u00a0 Whiskey gets a field day, as does Mercedes.\n\nThe cathartic violence against the \"john\" based on Rosie's mind reading powers, rewards its primary audience with instant street justice, the kind of gratification they're there for.\u00a0 If you're an anthropologist, new to North America, and want to learn some ropes, see this film, not just Borat.\u00a0 See it at a brewpub like I did, one that happens to show movies, eat some pizza, down some beer (they were out of 20 oz pints so I got two of the 16ers).\n\nWas it risky to target an albino for the kind of joke where you make fun of someone's appearance?\u00a0 The movie insists its harmless slapstick, basically vaudeville.\u00a0 People are just funny, what can we say?\u00a0 The other guy spoofs \"bad actor\" and that dovetails with our unconscious expectations.\u00a0 But this film is more wicked than predictable.\u00a0 I'm not going to diss it, so much as hold it out for anthropological study.\u00a0 I'd like more psychological anthropologists on the job, not shrinks so much as people who analyze culture.\u00a0 Saw a bunch [at Reed College](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/04/roller-coaster-at-reed.html) that time.\u00a0 Impressive.",
