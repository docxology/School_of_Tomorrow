  "content": "Does anyone still call it that, the \"blogosphere\" I mean?\u00a0 [Wikipedia has an entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere).\u00a0 We wouldn't call the term \"dated\" yet would we?\u00a0 The notion of \"blog\" itself is pretty recent, and bloggers still abound.\n\nAnyway, I like how the term has \"spheric\" in it, which describes \"a land without borders\" as in \"never coming to the edge\".\u00a0 A world that abruptly ended, at some cliff or river, would be not a sphere in that sense.\u00a0 A sphere lets you stumble every which way, and still be on it.\n\nSpeaking of stumbling around the planet, I read and watched about the summit meeting in Hanoi, twixt the DC civilian team and DPRK.\u00a0 I was happy enough with some side results to not be especially disappointed with a holding status quo.\u00a0 Part of how nation-states establish their longevity is by moving at a glacial pace.\u00a0 Be the hour hand.\u00a0 Live forever.\n\nDeeper things are going on in Korea that outsiders will appreciate, is what I'm thinking.\u00a0 What Americans think and do about Korea is not what matters, or at least that's how it should be.\u00a0 Americans should feel so relieved when the weight of the world is finally off their shoulders.\n\nIs it because Plymouth Rock was all about Puritans, or for other reasons, that Americans are so prudish?\u00a0 We burn through presidents on the basis of their peccadilloes quite a lot in seems to me.\u00a0 The home folks want morality plays, another term for soap opera.\n\nCongress is seeing new potential there, in hold highly televised hearings.\u00a0 Are we finally getting somewhere, in terms of stirring voters out of their apathy?\u00a0 The Kavanaugh hearings were like a pilot.\n\nI understand:\u00a0 the heroic partisans aren't really that offended by what's outwardly touted as the sin, but the less superficial reasons can't be prosecuted.\u00a0 We keep it shallow on purpose and so on.\u00a0 Didn't people vote for a playboy, a Hugh Hefner type?\u00a0 That was a way to reassert a kind of male dominant prowess no?\u00a0 Hawkish Hillary wasn't that different in some ways.\n\nForgive me if I get bored.\u00a0 I'm just thinking we could have a lot funner planet with different screenwriting.\u00a0 I didn't really like soap operas either.\n\nThey say it's not really about sex outside of marriage (with Clinton either, or with Kennedys), but the lying.\u00a0 I've grown up with presidents lying all my life.\u00a0 It's what they do.\u00a0 So?\u00a0 Goes with the territory.\n\nProhibition is and was interesting.\u00a0 When government aims to be \"secular\" that's a way of saying the different ethnicities can regulate \"what's moral\" to some degree, that's not our business.\u00a0 If your religion says it's OK to drink alcohol, then go for it -- as long as you're not a legal minor.\n\nBut this hands off attitude only goes so far, as we've seen, and the boundaries keep changing.\n\nSecularism includes the idea of rules, and therefore of breaking them.\u00a0 But does one follow rules to be \"good\"?\u00a0 Does one play chess for the halo?\n\nMarriage is a secular institution as well as a religious one.\n\nSpeaking of which (screenwriting), Patrick was full of great ideas today, regarding how Truckers for Peace (an academic program) might model itself after massage therapists who do the same thing (swap jobs and places to stay).\n\nWhich reminds me, I thought a genius piece of the Standard est Training was the \"needs a ride or place to stay\" segment.\n\nUh oh, I'm likely to veer into Scientology next.\u00a0 Talk about segues.\n\nRight when the Academy Awards were on, it turned out later, I was back in the old feud between the British BBC guy and the various factions of this powerful church, catching up on the movies (genre: documentary, expose).\n\nYou've gotta admit, it's a pretty gripping drama with all the elements, including families split down the middle, at the highest levels.\n\nWhen will someone run for US president with Scientologist on their resume?\n\nMy rude and crude Youtubes (I'm proud of some of them) keep me cycling through the Virus Meme, somewhat by design.\u00a0 I'll do another Medium story on that maybe.\n\nI've been contributing more Youtubes (U2oobs) to the meme pool.\u00a0 I mentioned some recent ones [on edu-sig](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2019-March/012067.html).\u00a0 I collect them [here](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/02/viral-videos.html) and there in my blogs.",
