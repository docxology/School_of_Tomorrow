  "content": ":: viewing a Q (actually a U) module ::\n(note: no sound track)\n\nLots of different namespaces use a lettering scheme to identify various geometrical \"building blocks.\" Tell Anderson came up with this \"U module\" nomenclature, [which Koski has adopted](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/synergeo/message/64876) as a part of his own geometric explorations, which may be started with this dissection of the Golden Cuboid with edges phi, 1/phi and 1.  What Bucky and Koski call [T modules](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/t-module.html) are angularly identical, but may fit into different regimes in terms of starting volumes.  Conversion constants may apply.\n\nWhat's important to Koski is the [T module](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/03/late-night-with-dave-koski.html) decomposes into a phi-scaled version of itself, plus these other modules emerge at every level:  the unresolved, the remainder, and this U, with each containing recursive ever-smaller versions of the others -- a kind of fractal or fractionation of a whole into self-similar parts.\n\nThe above Google Video was made using Camtasia Studio to view a [.wrl file](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/worlds/koski/Qmodgoldencuboid.wrl) in the [Cortona VRML client](http://www.parallelgraphics.com/products/cortona/) by Parallel Graphics.  This .wrl (world) file was in turn generated by [Scott Vorthmann's vZome](http://www.vorthmann.org/zome/), or \"virtual zome\" tool, written in Java, the edges and nodes having been put together by David on his Mac.",
