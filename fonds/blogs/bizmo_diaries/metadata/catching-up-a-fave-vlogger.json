I've mentioned her [before](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2021/02/playing-world-game.html).In a race-based mythology (such as some Germans wanted to believe in), one might start with whites beaming down as if from the Starship Enterprise, straight to the Caucasus region, a way to halt the narrative going backwards.\u00a0This is especially possible given Mt. Ararat is in nearby Turkey, where Noah's Arc came to rest and from which one human family emerged, a genetic bottleneck.\u00a0Not until the Tower of Babel debacle did humans escape the resulting groupthink and split up into Diaspora Nations, known today as \"races\". The whites come directly from ye olde Tower Project, by way of Europe and Penn Station.In a competing mythology, monkey-man spread to the Polynesian Islands, where a similar beaming down begot more polymorphic headwaters, associated with mammals going back to the sea (dolphins and whales), or going forward as ocean-based human navigators, who would spread their ways around Planet of the Apes.",
