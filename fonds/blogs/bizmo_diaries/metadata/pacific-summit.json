A lot of the guests are those Easterners I talk about, the transplant transatlantics, with their EU/UK mindset.\u00a0 Yukes turned Yanks.\n\nOut here on the Pacific Rim, we might be a tad less Atlantic-minded.\u00a0 We spin it differently.\n\n[](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Manufacturing_Consent_movie_poster.jpg?20171013011028)\n\n[deemed fair use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Manufacturing_Consent_movie_poster.jpg) by Wikipedia in accordance\u00a0with non-free copyright rules",
