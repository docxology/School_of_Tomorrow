Circadia Art Center [reminds me of Milepost 5](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/daily-bulletin.html) in some ways.  Another artist colony.From LindseyWalkerMusic:A Portland family moved to Nebraska a little bit ago to chase employment. They got into a terrible bicycle accident there. The man\u2019s face will need complete reconstructive surgery and may have brain damage but the severity and effects will not be known for a while. He also has thin blood and a heart problem which adds a serious risk of death to each surgical operation he has. The woman injured her knee. Their 3 yr old daughter was thankfully at home. She had just been laid off and he had just got a job that would support their family. He has no vacation or sick time. They need help covering rent while he\u2019s recovering. So we\u2019re throwing a benefit for them @ Circadia Art Center 4705 NE Columbia on Sept 11th 9pm. We have Naming Names, Karaoke, DJ as entertainment, Lindsey Walker and The Goodbye Party.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiJXoOtE1M82pqULdQIlh5jhy7m5-QERr6Cs19ZYXIis87a-PNsxBp2zDjc2qCFlIvh_cppkpIgkzG9cG3SsjoIaKJWxP1YamlzJvI-1HqARieajyr4XhBQCFfxt0oU80FMq3NG/s1600-h/Local+Lounge+Skull+Poster.JPG):: upcoming event ::[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3910878731/):: a pabst before show time ::",
