Other talking heads stake their reputations in various ways, carving out their positions.\n\nFrom an emailed review:\n\nThe movie is ambitious in that a wife-husband team try to take in a grand sweep of history view.\n\nThey point out various semi-obvious things, such as the fact that the military machine runs on BP etc., so one can't expect much protection from the more violence-prone based in DC, UK etc.\n\nThe dispersant used to make the oil sink to the bottom is having consequences that are still being studied. \u00a0Big dead zones in the Gulf. \u00a0Many unknowns.\n\nLots of people sick from all the spraying (the atmosphere has changed).\n\nWhat's somewhat amazing is how it's up to amateur non-scientist filmmakers to bring just about any of this to light, as the monied media have little interest in investigative journalism anymore.\nThere's a kind of born-yesterday innocence to the viewpoint, as if \"[corruption](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/09/investigating-how-things-work.html)\" were only just now being revealed.  We need a better word for the fact that world history does not always unfold according to our imagined ideals.  Of course it's a struggle to resist colonization and enslavement by one's fellow humans.  We have a pattern of forcing one another to work against our own best interests.  The right and freedom to pursue happiness?  Really? Even for \"little people\"? What will they think of next?",
