  "content": "Before our detractors get ahold of it, and say it sneeringly, lets add a Mickey Mouse Club spin and be happy for our growing ranks of Buckaneers and Buckaneer wannabes.\"Good morning boyz & girlz, and now let's see what [new toyz](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/toyz.html) we might share with you today\" (yes, I know you're sick and tired of killer rockets, bombs in cars, but take heart: this is a livingry show).\"Buckaneer\" is an alternative to \"Fullerite,\" \"Buckyophile,\" \"Fuller devotee\" and/or \"disciple\" (said with curled lip).  Kiyoshi came back with \"Adjuvant,\" which surprised people (hey, the guy was a genius, what can I say?).The good thing about \"Buckaneer\" is it has the right light-hearted [piratical flavor](http://www.answers.com/buccaneer&r=67), complete with the informality you'd expect among swashbucklers of either sex (although he liked to be called Captain, even Admiral, I don't deny it).It also rhymes with \"engineer\" (a design science connotation) and \"[bioneer](http://www.bioneers.org/)\" (a bridge to the [biological sciences](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/beyond-gene.html))).",
