  "content": "Once gun violence is normalized as the Way of the West, by way of Spaghetti Westerns (cowboy movies made in Italy), then plot resolutions become easier.\u00a0 You get to blow away certain characters, and you don't have a strong afterlife consensus, so the screen writer gets away with some not-haunted future.\u00a0 Yet one lives every day with one's memories.\n\nChances are, I'm going to find a gun-centric plot line rather too boring to encourage, in the sense of produce. My audiences are hungering for scalable models (both up and down) wherein people get along without resorting to the Easy Way.\u00a0 That's just too predictable, as in mechanical.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe've already seen that scene in every detail. Murder mysteries help get the ball rolling.\u00a0 Our deductive Sherlock Holmes powers get more of a workout that way.\n\nThis is not a screed about banning guns from movies.\u00a0 I'd be more into reintroducing ballistics in other guises, as I've been enjoying on Youtube, with the pressure gun shot at giant jars of mayo.\u00a0\n\nThere's serious calibration going on, but then we have the opportunity for some throwaway special effects, especially with those slow motion cameras.\u00a0\n\nWe start to learn a lot about physics, as in First Person Physics.\u00a0 The roller coaster teaches about kinetics, Newtonian mechanics. Imagine a world in which most physics majors were also skydivers.\n\nLikewise the science of trajectories and explosive events is nowhere more developed than in the civilian fireworks industry. The colorful and highly designed bouquets, timed to music in many cases, teach as much about the generalized principles as some of that cruise missile stuff.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDecouple the physics from weaponization and you're in a whole new world.\u00a0 Physics is cool again, vs enslaved by the hotheads.\n\nIn geek circles, \"learning X the hard way\" became a thing, one could say in backlash to the \"for dummies\" books, although I'd argue it's plenty hard either way, i.e. \"for dummies\" took on the tough topics. However some object to the whole style of dumbing it down to make it accessible.\u00a0 The point is to keep it as inaccessible as necessary to not be considered diluted or watered down at all.\n\n\"The hard way\" was code for \"undiluted\" like when a tourist asks for a meal just like the locals are eating. They're doing anthropology more than trying to cater to or pamper their own personal tastes.\u00a0 If personal taste had been a priority, then why not restaurant hop and write Yelp reviews?\u00a0 Those with a similar palette will learn to follow you around.\u00a0 No, the intrepid tourist is honest and sincere in wanting a clone, a carbon copy, of what the natives are getting.\u00a0 \"Don't dumb it down for me just because I'm an outsider\" the pro might convey.\n\nOn the other hand, lets leave the door open for more defensive methodologies, as sometimes \"going native\" is a recipe for disaster.\u00a0 As an outsider, untrained, not prepared, they'd be cruel to obey your directives and take you on their walk.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey'd also hurt their own chances, in taking you on as their burden.\u00a0 You being a sensitive anthropologist who understands there's a healthy balance between professional curiosity and taking foolish gambles.\n\nWe know from the movies that the reporter trying to \"embed\" in this or that police force or military, or lets say gang, is likely to encounter others not in the know and unsure of the agreements.\u00a0 The tribe that encounters your tribe sees they have you as an ostensive member.\u00a0 How does that impact inter-tribal calculations?\u00a0 As an anthropologist, it's not your intent to spark new tensions.\u00a0 The observer's role cannot honestly be erased in most cases, but it can be low profile.\n\nHaving spent time in Quarter World again recently (in walking radius), and thinking arcade games = language games (Wittgenstein's influence), while also keeping in mind the Coffee Shops Network charitable giving arcade palace (a place to see and be seen?), I'm back to designs for serious simulators, like pilots get, and maybe some truckers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYou get a lot more time on a simulator before they hand you a real car.\u00a0 But we're talking brainwashings of all types, and whom do you trust to brainwash your brain?\u00a0 I'd use hypertoons in mine.\u00a0 I'd be my own first subject, Guinea Pig K.\n\nTime in a high bandwidth pod might prove mind altering but in a good way.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese would take human subject experiments, which in some cases would mean tinkering with in-house prototypes and letting friends sign a waiver.\u00a0 They're just arcade games, enhanced to teach organic chemistry or calculus or one of those.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey don't replace what we've already got going, but for some prove an invaluable (as in valuable) supplement.\n\nGet more attention slices focused on risk-taking for charity, and practicing for professions, and you will have fewer attention slices left over for Easy Way screen writers.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCompete for a slice of the attention pie and wedge it bigger, with quality programming that doesn't happen to hinge on firing projectiles at one another.\u00a0 That's more TV-14 through R.\u00a0 Imagine a new rated MN for Mature Nonviolent, very triggering to some viewers.\u00a0 \"What about deductive thinking, wouldn't it go out the window?\"\u00a0 As if great powers of deduction were on display today.\u00a0 Guns Dumb Ya Down (or at least there's that risk).",
