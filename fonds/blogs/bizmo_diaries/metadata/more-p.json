  "content": "Cube With Guts\nAndrew Frank\n[https://t.co/InXqq60RyE](https://t.co/InXqq60RyE)\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [January 2, 2017](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/815724553162764288)\n\nWhat I got out of Wittgenstein: a smooth way to gear shift away from fundamentalist qyoobism a viral ideology leading to lockjaw & paralysis\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [December 30, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/814640865532518400)\n\nA fundamentalist qyoobist extremist closes eyes and ears and shouts \"nyah nyah I can't hear you\" if you question Holy Qyoob's all-greatness.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [December 30, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/814641297981992960)\n\n\"Holy Qyoob\" pronounced \"kewb\" and more commonly spelled \"Cube\" sometimes poses as a \"simplest shape\" then suffers acute imposter syndrome.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [December 30, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/814641838334193664)\n\nChildren are forced to bow down to Holy Cube (\"qyoob\") by quisling numberphiles. \"Kiss the feet of our unit of volume\" they insist. Resist!\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [December 30, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/814642578427559936)\n\nOnce liberated from Qyoobism and its fundamentalist orthodoxies, you will seem anti-normal, a threat. Church of Subgenius offers sanctuary.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [December 30, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/814643156197089280)\n\nEither / Or is the Fallacy. XYZ and IVM namespaces coexist no problem. The goal is to stabilize the cube, not to kick it off stage. Win-win.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [January 2, 2017](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/815822919007772673)\n\nPraise Bob!",
