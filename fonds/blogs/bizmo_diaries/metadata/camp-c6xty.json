My approach is to keep my content Humanities flavored (that sounds somewhat cannibalistic I realize), meaning I'm not spinning my home base as a place within STEM territory.\u00a0\u00a0We bridge to STEM, over the C.P. Snow chasm, with our C6XTY bridge (there's a marketing angle). The point of casting it this way is to not make STEM, mathematicians in particular, the bottleneck.\u00a0 Given their track record, we can expect little to no help from the Mathematics Department on this one.\u00a0 Philosophy has had to step up to the plate, with links to Literature.\u00a0 We're more in PATH (Philosophy Anthropology Theater History) than in STEM.You might think the rap above would have nothing to do with the Rastafarian | Pastafarian combo I'd like to see center stage at the Justice Center, once there's some serious equipment.\u00a0\u00a0Why not a full sound and light show, impromptu?\u00a0 Food carts?\u00a0 I'm not saying I'd go, because of Covid.\u00a0 If the actual downtown presence shrinks yet continues to stream the process, I'll have felt part of something.Seriously, I'd turn the downtown scene into a reggae festival, given the Blues Festival was denied us this year.\u00a0 The link is [the importance of streaming](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2020/07/shakespeare-in-park.html), and the fact of a larger audience watching from home. That's how our school works as well.\u00a0 If you were following Lattice Gallery last winter, in downtown Portland, you were probably doing so remotely, perhaps from Japan or Korea.Portlanders are missing all their favorite summer events and have needed to channel some of that disappointment into an already frustrating push for social change.\u00a0 There's a need to keep it real and focused and not just go for fluff.\u00a0 My suggestions qualify as \"peanut gallery\" as I'm more kibbitzer than producer in this picture.Dr. D. and Glenn were also properly ordained for the occasion.\u00a0 I'll plan to invite DB for the next one. We're still keeping the numbers down.\u00a0 Blue House has been through many chapters.",
