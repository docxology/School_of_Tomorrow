  "content": "We're deep in the thick of things.\u00a0 The tutorial leader gave us really quick instructions for grabbing some fake Ethereum after setting up a MetaMask wallet.\n\nI got lost right away.\u00a0 I was supposed to tweet a request to [Rinkeby](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).\u00a0 I used a hex number MetaMask gave me (I thought), but that doesn't appear to be my account.\u00a0 It's fake money anyway, not real Ethereum.\n\nThe geeks are asking questions about crypto-currency in general.\u00a0 Bitcoin swings thirteen standard deviations, says the professor, meaning it's considered high risk.\u00a0 Is it really a store of value?\u00a0 Ethereum swings by twelve standard deviations.\n\nLibra, Gemini and some others try to limit volatility by pegging their value to something supposedly less volatile, such as a fiat currency.\n\nWe're doing more meta discussion of crypto stuff than coding.\u00a0 Geth is the golang implementation of the full Ethereum node.\u00a0 That's not something most people should run.\n\nWe get a lot of science fiction about crypto-currencies these days.\u00a0 People have a lot of hope in their future.\n\nSmart contracts in Ethereum are written in Solidity.\n\n0xB4824D11AddB0c0a6f63ddb30ff601Fb9AB912b3\u00a0appears to be my account.\u00a0 I sent a tweet with it, requesting fake Ether, but I sent another request earlier.\u00a0 What was that?\u00a0 I deleted both tweets.\n\nWant to send me some Ethereum, a few wei?\u00a0\u00a0I named it OSCON 2019.\u00a0 Then email me maybe?\u00a0 We're experimenting.\n\nMy ears are perking up as we're doing a marriage contract in Solidity, for a \"decentralized city\".\u00a0 Asylum City?\u00a0 That's science fiction I've invested in.\u00a0 Science fiction is an umbrella term for me, that covers any kind of actual planning for the future.\u00a0 Investment banking would be a subcategory.\n\nI'm thinking of a currency that is meaningful within a city.\u00a0 Lots of things won't work unless fueled by city crypto.\u00a0 Dollar bills don't go in the slots; wallet cards do.\n\nIs this a case of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgJBQsQrJJPlheXUfw8c0s8QFBqnpydvkj0k0pvLhyphenhyphen2SoF9EW_-sy6k3ePtrrQWHF25gf488l8BPa-KWg62V9HHteDYtpXk67BTAOsRk5ED77LR__VDrwNS-4XfWIhrMOW4O-9N/s1600/marriage.PNG)\n\nTokens cost nothing to create in Ethereum, and mean nothing in particular by default.\u00a0 \u00a0Don't confuse them with crypto-currencies.\u00a0 Tokens are basically keys to a hashmap.\n\nTokens are fungible or non-fungible.\u00a0 The fungible tokens have \"face value\" we might say.\u00a0 NFTs include CryptoKitties.\u00a0 They might represent credentials or merit badges.\n\nCompanies that recorded a lot of video about blockchain might be in trouble right now, because everything is changing so fast.\u00a0 This ecosystem is very fragile.\u00a0 I think I'll call it a day.",
