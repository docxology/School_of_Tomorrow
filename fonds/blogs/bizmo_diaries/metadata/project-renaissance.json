  "content": "My long term readers will likely have run into Project Renaissance at my Grunch.net website, which this Youtube scans in to video memory.  I've been doing such backups, with overvoice narration giving more context.\n\nHere I'm talking about a synergy twixt R&D divisions and front-line field-testing not-for-profits, where you get a lot of scientists committed to advancing knowledge and standards, more than building up earthly goods.  Engineers need some dare devils and are occasionally the same person (hence the \"mad inventor\" stereotype).\n\nCase in point:  any new stadium-shaped city on the model of Old Man River would need to document its flaws and failures, as well as its many wins, so that coming generations could improve the designs.  This is hardly a new need.  Scientists keep lab notebooks.  Goes with the territory.\n\nIn Project Renaissance, we pay ourselves to do what's needed, versus funding a lot of expensive soaps.  We still have dramatic lives, as how could we not.  However we also get more work done healing the ecosystem.  That would be the goal anyway.  Trial and error, along with the element of surprise, have not been ironed out by \"machine learning\" or anything like that.  On the contrary, the predominant storyline is VUCA-esque (life's chaotic). \n\nWe're experiencing what Alvin Toffler presciently called \"accelerating acceleration\" (or \"future shock\" in his vernacular).",
