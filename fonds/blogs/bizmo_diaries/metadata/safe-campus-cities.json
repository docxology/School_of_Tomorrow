  "content": "Any talk of holding or detention centers (on what charge? for what offense?) sparks worries that cross the road to ignite corresponding concerns in our plans and storyboards for campus facilities aimed at accommodating people with only a few assets.\n\nIf you have a lot of assets back at home, you're not expected to store all these on campus, unless your goal is to contribute to the pool of recyclables.\u00a0 Let people mix and match.\n\nLarge open spaces for assembly scare people, although the sound stage motif is very common. Corporate events, such as celebrating a new computer language, may use a sound stage and go for a \"rock concert\" look and feel.\u00a0 Any lack of large open spaces for assembly also scares people.\u00a0 You need those.\u00a0 Thriving communities have those.\n\nWe're clearly entering Christopher Alexander territory in looking for the pattern language of the campus.\u00a0 Occupy went here, exploring for models.\u00a0 We didn't have a lot of [pods to play with](https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/10/cubbies.html), wired to both receive and transmit.\n\nI'm aiming for the \"comfy carrel\" or \"cave\" that's not locked from the outside.\u00a0\u00a0 You will say I'm avoiding designing prisons.\u00a0 I'll say that's correct, not a proficiency.\u00a0 However I'm a student of institutions and learn from fact and fiction regarding many.\n\nThe dystopian Black Mirror type episodes, around some cultural innovation, provide points of resistance and give people pause.\u00a0 \"Do we really want to go there?\"\u00a0 Oft times, we really don't, and yet there's somewhere else, close by, same neighborhood, we consider a worthy destination.\u00a0 We need to aim.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/26801619080/in/photolist-MWcCCk-24nKxN1-QQpNj1-HpWezM-GQniAG)",
