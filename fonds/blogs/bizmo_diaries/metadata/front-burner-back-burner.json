Ju for Julia, Pyt for Python, Er for R.The focus is ball packing:  triangular and square numbers (figurate on a plain (plane)); tetrahedral and cuboctahedral (= icosahedral) in space.  A student is co-developing a lexical skill (coding language) with a graphical skill (visualizing balls packing in space).\u00a0\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg9O2CxL7sCPSWzwnJokpj_fTCdalc9WOFuZavdQRaFmoefmU1sQDT3s2fkA-AAdfXRO7tj1reKCJ-6bpcHvrEFXx4PB_RUACKBvCEVPS_FyrXfSOulvFNcZhce4axI8d9uv-uY/s1373/cuboid_project_replit2.jpg)Python replit and [OEIS A005901](https://oeis.org/A005901)[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg4iBbgygjre5YA-SRBJJz7MHie3M1Ll0frY9CotFfvxW0xb9qJjUlc8wpiClrXDv-jNKBIGGf5khcPiXcGn2-KTuKnhJHge4gDQtcDBUA6QZ3v5I8XF_8rI6A0Fivxfel6u-se/s225/cubanim.gif)\n\nThis way we get an algebra-geometry bridge before (independently of) a coordinate system (which comes next).",
