No KTU3 jumped out at me, which was fine.Carla's annual box of treats, including a picture of a now all grown up Stevie, arrived in the mail yesterday, Carla being Dawn's sister, the youngest of three, Sam being the eldest.After the split with Don, Glenys took Sam and Dawn to live with [Bud](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/back-to-silicon-forest.html), while Carla remained with her dad. Don and I got along pretty well (never a hard word, that I can recall), but he'd mellowed with age by the time we overlapped.",
