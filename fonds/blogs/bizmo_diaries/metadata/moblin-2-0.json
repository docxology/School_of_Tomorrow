  "content": "This presentation by Dirk Hohndel from Intel is about a class of new devices now ready for the mass market.  We have lots of proprietary ways of doing the software, but to drive innovation and participation, a truly open source approach is the best way to go.Mark's notion of [designing for plugins](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/07/business-buzz.html), making platforms very open (like Mozilla FireFox) is apropos of this discussion.Moblin 2 (Fedora... Gnome) will be an open stack, i.e. no lock in -- too bad no build platform ready yet (four weeks?).  The hope is the community will take ownership and move this project forward, per R0ml's \"exceptional software\" platform (see below).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiHlmvHeKQFSVtLNAhmryDmZOsaLpVH75rtEEkEwm7CMKsYjxrzsztyiv8QUo70aD_Frta7f3efqqhyphenhyphenQzFi8po6piXRfDCaMnFWgIzHrwBZ9qhRq1e2tak5xuSR1ZE0yN1n0MLX/s1600-h/oscon_chess.jpg)",
