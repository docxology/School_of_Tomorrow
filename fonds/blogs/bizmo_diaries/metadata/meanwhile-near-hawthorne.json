  "content": "Caught John Roberts (the anchor, not the Supreme Court nominee) getting rid of his tie last night, following a segment on down-dressing business class Japanese (still formal, just minus the jacket and tie).  Then today in Powell's I found [Fruits](http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0714840831/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-1279099-5174410#reader-link), by Phaidon, about fashion-savvy teens in and around Tokyo, setting new trends.  \"Fruits\" carries no specific connotations regarding sexual orientation in this context, unless you count polymorphously perverse.What cracked me up on CBS last night was the story about DARPA trying to turn those cute robot puppies into vicious dogs of war, and maybe those Segways\u2122 (straight out of Fantasia's Sorcerer's Apprentice) into silent stalkers.  Leave it to DARPA to put a scary sinister spin on anything (even Python -- actually Python was easy).I eyed the news while packing a night bag for Tara, who slept at the Oregon Zoo (Brenna too), part of a programmed summer camp experience for youngsters in this town.  Dawn was in post-op, Short Stay, but not for anything too serious, and I fetched her home later that evening, having spent the better part of the day at the hospital, where I almost finished Quicksilver (so today I bought The Confusion, and a map of Rome).",
