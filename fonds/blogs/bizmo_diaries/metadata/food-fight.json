  "content": "Mobsters accusing mobsters of harboring a criminal element is a sight to behold.\u00a0 We're supposed to find a deep moral difference between \"Russian 1%\" and the others, whereas Occupy looked much the same in Moscow (a confrontation).\n\nA criminal sphere embraces a more game-like lawful world, sometimes with crushing effectiveness, other times more divided and self recriminatory.\u00a0 The latter phase is what we're in.\u00a0 The mobsters are all outing each other as the onlookers grow more financially literate by the week.\n\nTrampled underfoot is an old world order, somewhat forgotten, wherein the cyber-sphere seemed less tabloid. The action needed to be dumbed down a lot as we democratized more.\u00a0 I sound [elitist](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/08/elitism.html) for saying that, but it's more [esoterica](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/explaining-esoterica.html) that I'm into.",
