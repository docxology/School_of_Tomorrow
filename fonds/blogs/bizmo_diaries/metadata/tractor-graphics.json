  "content": "What you'll find in many curricula that take up coding, is code that builds upon itself.\n\nTaking advantage of what we've done already, we branch this way and that, exploring different topics.\n\nA rigid march through a terrain is different from exploring it.  The latter job is for scouts and surveyors, the ones who map out a territory.\n\nThe marchers usually come through when preplanned routes have been paved, or call them roads.\u00a0 We're bringing people through at high volume at a steady pace.\u00a0 The route may have some known obstacles or rough patches.\n\nThen you get the Roman soldiers and what not.\n\nIn Placed Based Education, we encourage students to learn about, and share about, their immediate neighborhood, looking for ways to contextualize what's local in contained scopes.\n\nFor example, in these videos, we're exploring Asylum District (centered around one Hawthorne Boulevard, named for the first doctor to run a mental asylum in the state of Oregon).\n\nI use the local scene as a jumping off point to begin exploring more of American History, which includes Americans in the north asserting their Manifest Destiny over peoples (other Americans) to the south.\n\nThis pattern has a lot of inertia and we see more consequences of this ideology in our own time.\n\nIn the Youtube below, I get the wrong Roosevelt, saying \"FDR\" instead of \"Teddy\".\u00a0 In [the subsequent Youtube](https://youtu.be/pPAzJOPDywc), I go back over that history, fix the mistake, and take a somewhat deeper look.",
