  "content": "Sometimes I drive around Oregon imagining where the campus facilities might go.\u00a0 Something that's part of a wind farm and already hooked up to take care of power generating, makes it useful to staff from the start.\u00a0 Add cultural radio (mixed bag).\u00a0 If there's anyone in radius that is (sometimes I'm far off the grid, in ranch country -- you'll still have windmills though, if along the Columbia Gorge).\n\nIf you go back in my blogs and [on Medium](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/fintech-for-social-responsibility-9230e5e1be58), you'll see where my head is at, as some kind of Sam Hill principal in some School of Tomorrow (experimental, prototype).\u00a0 But would my expensing all that driving as \"for business\" make sense?\u00a0 In a Quaker Meeting sense it might.\u00a0 Warm Springs reservation was on my circuit.\n\nI talk more about casinos in [Casino Math](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2019/02/casino-math.html), obviously.\u00a0 That's a topic area in my Digital Math curriculum, established on Wikieducator and then put into practice (experimental, prototype) here and there, with willing risk takers.\n\nPeople who march off to camp to try something new may be risk takers.\u00a0 What needs testing might not be weapons of war, in my Civilian Service scenario, but in terms of getting outdoorsy, there's lots of overlap.\u00a0 \"Math is an Outdoor Sport\" say my virtual billboards.\u00a0 Using GPS and/or following a treasure map, takes some trigonometry.\n\nI've been doing fly throughs of neurobiology on Youtube, the better to stimulate my hypertoon receptors.",
