  "content": "Those who've [played Sims](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/01/sims.html) more than a little know it's sometimes fun to \"game the game\", e.g. in some scenarios, just give each Sim a bed and a refrigerator.\u00a0 The house can come later.\u00a0 Give every Sim a smartphone... actually they didn't have those did they?\n\nSimTopia is a genre with the premise that things basically work, and it's set up energetically to pencil out.\u00a0 We surf the solar gradient, each a 100-200 watt bulb.\u00a0 Keeping us lit really doesn't take that much energy, so we have disposable income atop survival.\u00a0 Such is our game board (a sphere).\n\nWhat some philosophers maybe miss about Utopian models is they're not so much \"pie in the sky\" as \"in your eye\" meaning if it's a believable model using existing technology, then the fact that we actually [live in squalor](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/war-story.html) only speaks to our inferior intelligence, our lack of competence.\u00a0 Believable utopias seem to mock us from their perch in unreality, saying \"you could have been here by now\".\u00a0 Those feeling superior to utopians are maybe not as well versed in math and science.\n\nYet feelings of inferiority have a lot of self-fulfilling aspects and I'm not so foolish as to grab the pulpit merely to sneer about our basket case Earth and preach some \"I told you so\" gospel.\u00a0 That's too easy and cheap.\u00a0 I will settle for \"a bit edgy\" in that it does feel uncomfortable that we so deliberately miss-steer.\u00a0 We appear to wallow sometimes, even fly off the rails.\n\nIn the background:\u00a0 Greece, a fiction -- but people feel strongly about stories (what else do we have?) -- is in financial trouble per narrative accounts.\u00a0 An entirely different Sims game could try to give a sense of the dynamics there.\u00a0 As a Cradle of Civilization and HQS for the Cult of Athena, I do think going [back to first principles](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html) is a logical move.\n\nHowever being a Cradle of Civilization doesn't always mean much, in terms of getting respect.\u00a0 If people want good paying family wage jobs, how about repairing Baghdad (more cryptically \"[Algebra City](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/serving-from-algebra-city.html)\" in some neighborhoods).\u00a0 People today will diss their own cultural roots without much pause for reflection.\u00a0 The slow food movement, like the slow reading movement, is about [remembering to remember](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/05/voting-machines.html).\n\nDoes it pencil out?\u00a0 What is the energy income of Earth?\u00a0 Lets stop dialing back to writers in the early 1900s who had no pictures of Spaceship Earth yet, shot from far outside the atmosphere.\u00a0 Lets remember this is 2015 and talk again [about planetary biology](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/01/sim-farm.html), the prospects for human life.\u00a0 There's a gas mix to talk about, sometimes known as \"climate\", and much more besides.\n\n[A Sims game](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/03/more-on-sims.html) is only programmable because so much is dropped out.\u00a0 Only reality has enough computing power to compute reality.\u00a0 The World computes the World.\u00a0 The parts are even less of the whole than we'd realized, a negative way of talking about Synergy, but the good news is everything is under control, thanks to no tiny cabal.\n\nJust saying:\u00a0 in developing a game of Sims, a SimTopia even, I am not thereby gaining a Crystal Ball.\u00a0 Too much is missing.\u00a0 We're [talking about a model](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html), not an oracle.\u00a0 No Holy Grail here either, sorry, just I welcome Greece for its logic (logos).\u00a0 SimTopia should have some [Greek features](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2014/12/more-playing-with-greek-mythos.html).",
