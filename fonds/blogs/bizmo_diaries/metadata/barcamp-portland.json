  "content": "I learned about [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/BarCampPortland) from Jason of [Virtuous](http://virtuous.com/info/) at the recent [Python Meetup](http://python.meetup.com/183/). The venue is [CubeSpace](http://cubespacepdx.com/), a rennovated cube farm formerly a US Bank back office on Grand Avenue.Barcamp is a somewhat self-organizing investigation into contemporary geek culture.During networking time, I met up with Marshall Kirkpatrick of [Splashcast](http://splashcastmedia.com/), and [Chris Bretano](http://www.downloadsquad.com/bloggers/chris-brentano) of [Download Squad](http://www.downloadsquad.com/), who'd actually [reviewed Splashcast](http://www.downloadsquad.com/2007/02/01/republish-the-net-with-splashcast/) back in February.I'm working to syndicate my flickr photos from this evening through a embedded Splashcaster, with Internet Explorer crashing a number of times as the Flash ActiveX object encounters problems.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgQcnAmYeuiKaO_xpwA_1caS72ES8Lz2eESvSTmrLp4fZw1SpMVQD-FI88GSRBzNfvpBDCDHftMZL9Xjf74cSddVZ_t99Z-G54Gt0Uw7zGOlvCLTuwDP_78kDrz2lQ31dwePDPs/s1600-h/flasherror.png)I also met up with Jeff, Martin and Kevin, young Free Geeks I know from our [CollabTech experience](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/05/studio-how-to.html) with HomeStreet. And with [Ki Master George](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/08/el-fish.html), a talented former student.:: Portland barcamp 2007 ::",
