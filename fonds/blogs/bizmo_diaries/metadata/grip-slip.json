So sorry.I've been leaving a somewhat tortuous trail of [signature lesson plans](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1917995&tstart=0) at the Math Forum that at least [Anna](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/more-school-business.html) is looking at.In terms of breaking through to a wider public, that's proving difficult in this economy.
