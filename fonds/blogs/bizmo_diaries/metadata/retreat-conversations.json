  "content": "Lew Scholl today at Meeting updated me on some of the things happening with Google Earth.\u00a0 I'd noticed that his painstaking [rendering of the Pauling House](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwarehouse/details?mid=784c529ace3127661955e09f18bdf60c) appeared to have been replace with something more sketchy.\n\nWere they over-taxing their computer power, extending beyond their own reach, and now needing to dumb things down a little more? \n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/9121333770/)\n\nSpeaking of Google Earth, we were talking about \"ask not what Dufur can do fer you but rather what you can do fer Dufur\", a apocryphal town motto attributed to Dufur, Oregon (not Darfur),\u00a0 and I \"flew\" there in Google Earth and then started absent mindedly following route 197 in a northerly direction... woah, what's that?\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/9121405982/)\n\nCelilo Converter Station off Route 197\n\nA very space-alien looking facility, something to attract the attention of the paranoid.\u00a0 We checked it out.\u00a0 Ah so, the northern terminal of the [HDVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current) Pacific Intertie twixt the Columbia River and [LA](http://www.blue-marble.de/nightlights/2012?ll=34.310833,-118.489167).\n\nEurope has a bunch of these links too, with more on [the global drawing board](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/02/connecting-with-friends.html). The old mercury arc types are giving way to those using thyristors.\n\nOf such stuff is a Wanderers conversation made, not trying to scare ya off or anything.\u00a0 It's a Nerd Fest you might say.",
