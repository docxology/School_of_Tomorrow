The Synergeo list is proving a strong source of some new ones.  Figuring out clear screen animations for projecting to LCDs, in the Coffee Shops Network for example, requires storyboarding in advance.

That's a tall order for a rapidly expanding academic program.  Student housing may result in more campus households such as mine, which I connect to the Pauling Campus in 97214.
