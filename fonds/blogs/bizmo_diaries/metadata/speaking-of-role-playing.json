  "content": "I have reason to use this clip in a somewhat academic context, in a footnote to [some timeit() project ](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/timeit.html)where different versions have to race.  The student is asked to cut a function's time by almost two thirds or more.\n\nRather than destroy the slower function, the two versions are raced, or maybe more than two.  In my thinking, this image of a \"snail race\" occurs, and this movie clip, which makes it all come alive in CG.\n\nI also appreciate this clip because of its resonance with real life situations of course.  The film was obviously made with children in mind, and they know getting teased and/or teasing at recess.\u00a0 They got teased for being \"a crier\" perhaps; and sure enough, one of the snails is immediately picked on by a bully.\n\nThere's no time to waste developing personalities however.  The film itself does that at leisure, but our clip merely takes us to the races.\u00a0 Barely more than a minute.\u00a0 Yet a winner is found.\u00a0 Given this is a cartoon, the laws of physics need not apply.\n\nThe premise of this movie his hilarious:  a snail with aspirations to become a speed demon.  The sheer idiocy of the premise, combined with expert follow-through, makes this a favorite of mine.  I've already reviewed it.\u00a0 Check it out.\u00a0 Oops, sorry I'm slow... can't find it.",
