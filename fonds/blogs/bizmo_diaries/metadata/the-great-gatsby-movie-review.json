  "content": "\"I was the same man inside and outside\" is one of the refrains.\n\nSo is he betraying erstwhile friends in spilling these beans, or do we know from the get go it's a fantasy?\n\nGatsby is a self made man, in the estimation of our morbidly alcoholic in patient.\n\nWe think our Old Sport gets out, [by telling his story](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/11/seven-psychopaths-movie-review.html), restoring perspective and sobriety.\n\nAt least he's learned some self discipline, thanks to a kind doctor who wants to nudge him along.\n\nLike, if you study literature at Yale, what makes you think you're cut out to sell bonds?\u00a0 No, you need to fall in love with your characters.\n\nHe's sailed around the world, went to Oxford, a war hero, and now he's at the top of the heap, all for love.\u00a0 He's the hero of his own life, defined by his quest.\n\nAnyway, whatever the critics say, I'm fine with this blending of imaginative, faux reality, with everyday movie-making competence.\u00a0 We saw some of that in [J. Edgar](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/11/j-edgar-movie-review.html), even [The Aviator](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/05/aviator-movie-review.html).\n\nThe Coal World ([a Machine World](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-about-narnia.html) -- a Matrix) with the all-seeing billboard is clearly the occult unconscious, that feared-yet-attractive place, black and bleak, a place on which the rich project their darkest fantasies.\n\nOur storyteller is initiated into this underground through his mentor's \"game world\", through a gas station, which for me echoed with eXistenZ and the gas station there.\u00a0 Be a player.\u00a0 Hop in.\n\nWhat sustains the Gatsby's hope is his dream has come so far.\u00a0 The dream-like quality of the scenery continues to feel like \"in someone's head\".\n\nThe storyteller is in a sanitarium we remember, with a case of writer's block.\u00a0 We're living his dream, of perfection.\u00a0 An alter ego.\n\nGatsby pushes too hard but who can blame him when he's so close.\u00a0 He kind of blows it, there's a train wreck (metaphorically) and we, the omniscient voyeurs, see the waves of fear coming in.\n\n\"The best she could come up with was...\" another refrain.\u00a0 We fall short.\u00a0 Tragic.\n\nOperatic, that's the word.\u00a0 The sets seem \"fake\" only in the sense that all fiction is \"fake\" -- a forgivable (indeed encouraged) playing with our truths.\u00a0 An exploratorium, this skulletarium.\n\nThe grand estate-based aristocratic lifestyle with many servants, a choreographed affair, added to the sense of \"a musical\" with an all-dancers cast.\n\nThe panorama of the parties is very cabaret, like Moulin Rouge. \"Very Fellini\" said mom, astutely, thinking of [Satyricon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064940/).\n\nThe city is very Gotham.\u00a0 There's even a bat mobile of sorts.\n\nUnderwater again... love seems to end this way for DiCaprio.\n\nSlinky Debicki was [the perfect glamor girl](http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1656202752/nm4456120).",
