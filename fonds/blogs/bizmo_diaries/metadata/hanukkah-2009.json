We're planning to skip Xmas this year. Xmas is a commercial holiday and we're not doing much commerce these days.\n\nI gave out [Flextegrity pods](http://www.flextegrity.com/) as gifts, which were a big hit.\n\nOn Synergeo I've been ranting about the dictatorship's refusal to allow our ethnicity a place in the sun. Feels like Egypt in some ways. Teaching the math in the tables below is just not part of this culture.\n\nThat probably seems like a small thing, but for me, it's something of a show stopper. I at least get to rant about it, file my laments.\n\nGreat latkas as usual. Tara will see the doctor tomorrow. I was contacted by the driver who hit her last night. Oversight Committee was supportive. I'm something of a basket case, glad to have friends and life coaches.",
