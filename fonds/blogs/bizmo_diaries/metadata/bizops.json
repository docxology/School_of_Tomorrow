I've already been downtown twice today by car to drop and fetch Carol from here WILPF meeting. \u00a0I'm happy to chauffeur an 86 year old internationally recognized peace activist to and from her planning meetings.\n\nYesterday I got a shipment of Lux Blox from [the inventors](http://www.galesburg.com/article/20150705/NEWS/150709930). \u00a0The toy currently consists of a single atomic square tile, not unlike [Polymorf\u00a0(another toy)](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/toyz.html) in creating a hinge when conjoined with a neighbor. \u00a0Its flexibility adds a dimension.\n\nSince I'd just been sharing some [Martian Math storyboards](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/10/so-you-wanna-be-martian-math-teacher.html), I built a perimeter, a protective fence, to keep the Earthlings from barging into \"the Martian apartments\" a tetrahedral stack of icosahedral cocoons. \u00a0Of course I'm [using Flextegrity](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/03/workshop-scenarios.html), another product oft placed in my blogs.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/22075440035/in/album-72157624750749042/)\n\n:: airplane for scale ::\n\nI put the [Lux Blox](http://www.luxblox.com/) toymaker in touch with a Chinese STEM toys specialist, just helping him grow the network. \u00a0Who knows if that will go anywhere, right? \u00a0We have a number of Quaker families in Portland with experience doing business in, or with, Chinese companies. \u00a0Portland is on the Pacific Rim after all.\n\nGeometry toyz have [long been a focus](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/01/biz-notes.html) of mine, including work on [Strange Attractors](https://flic.kr/p/JotCu)\u00a0by [Design Science Toys](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/tale-of-two-toymen.html) (no longer in business).\u00a0 Flextegrity is not a toy.\n\nI sometimes call 'em the \"toyz\" to make 'em more edgy, as in: for adults as well. \u00a0I'm into [andragogy](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/07/more-andragogy.html) as well as pedagogy. \u00a0I don't want the stereotype of \"toys are for children\" to preclude older people learning some Synergetics (a philosophy) or Python (a computer language) or whatever subjects I'm currently out there teaching.",
