Tabor, I dropped by QuarterWorld, a local arcade game palace now for those aged 21 and older, or maybe it was always that way?\u00a0 There's a bar.\n\nGiven the pandemic, I haven't stuck my head in that place for years.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDr. D. joined me, his first time in that place, and promptly scored top score for the day one of his old favorites:\u00a0 Joust.\n\nI didn't play any games this time, but I did have a couple beers, including this brand I'd never tried before: Game On! from Level Beer.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/51976482409/in/dateposted-public/)",
