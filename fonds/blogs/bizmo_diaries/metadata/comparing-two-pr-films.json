I may have embedded this one before, in an earlier blog post.\n\nThe theme is related to \"bomb shelter\" i.e. we're here to weather some kind of holocaust -- and strike back if necessary, is the undertone.\n\nTo \"declassify\" is to add to the authenticity of something, i.e. \"this was once too important a secret to share with the likes of you.\" An attention getter.\n\nHowever, over time, the secrets tend to come out and the narrative gets updated.\n\nWe call that \"learning from experience\" and it's often a slow process.",
