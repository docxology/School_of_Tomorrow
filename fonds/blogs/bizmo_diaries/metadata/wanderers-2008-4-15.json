Of course any given community ([Catalina](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/02/back-from-catalina.html) comes to mind) may post no vacancy signs.  We still encounter barriers, [gatekeepers](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/pr.html), locked doors and so on.As [a futurist](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/04/quaker-spectrum.html), I tend to use a [global university](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gstuniv.html) metaphor, bordering on [hospital](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/futurism-revisited.html) (so call it a teaching hospital), then seek solutions in those terms.  And don't call the Earthian economy a \"closed system\" as our main energy source is [a star](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html).I distributed one copy of Pythonic Quaker, my new DVD.",
