  "content": "I was awake at 7 AM to catch CBS Sunday Morning, which I'm not saying is my routine. I teased myself with the prospect of bopping over to Quakers', hopping on the 8:30 \"slow-moving\" (like a train, figuratively), an \"adult discussion\" (free-wheeling, worship-sharing format usually?).\n\nI'm not one of the regulars these days. Loyal conductors see it through.\n\nSpeaking of loyal conductors, I caught the \"exit interview\" by outgoing DoD boss Mattis, an interview spread over two segments (commercial chopping block).\u00a0 He'd been a skeptic on invading Iraq but when you're part of the manpower, following orders is the rule.\n\nHe'd been at loggerheads with two \"hat-shaped office\" holders.\n\nThe \"loyal conductors\" of SMAD (Sunday Morning Adult Discussion) would include Marson and Wish for sure, and also our friend Richard.\u00a0 As we're of the liberal, unprogrammed persuasion (Quaker jargon) there's not as much interest in belief-system wheel-spinning during actual worship.\n\nSMAD is a place to exercise a more systematic approach.\u00a0 We use Meeting to build strengths we'll need in civil society.\n\nAs things turned out, I caught the interview and then tuned out, turning to various other social media for continuity (and fewer commercial distractions).\n\nA faction of the voting population plans on supporting Tulsi independently of CNN-DNC apparently, banking on her Wonder Woman appeal.\u00a0 I'm sensing \"Russian bots\" in the area, meaning an intelligentsia into ersatz samizdat has developed a keen interest in so-called \"progressives\" (always a volatile term of fuzzy meaning).\n\nSpeaking of words with fuzzy meanings, I mean to search for websites telling us whether ancient Egypt was more socialist or capitalist.\u00a0 Do we assume Rome was fascist then?\u00a0 I sometimes say \"neo-Roman\" with reference to some of the Manifest Destiny memes.\n\nAs I've mentioned previously, conducting debates in terms unlikely to hold persistent meanings, because historically not well-established enough, may prove too time-wasting.\u00a0 Risk assessment gurus keep testing the waters, regarding whether to brand as more socially responsible.\u00a0 The character of the various corporate personhoods is being tested.\n\nGST (decoded elsewhere) looks to engineering and design science a lot more, leaving political science to get more inventive if that's what it needs to do.\u00a0 Customary namespaces have ways to provide continuity to their customers, while making room for noob discourses.\u00a0 Or maybe not so noob, just a bit other-worldly.\n\nSpeaking of other-worldly, Glenn Stockton and I had an interesting conversation about abduction stories in the UFO literature, over a couple IPAs at the local supermarket oasis.\n\nFor those of you just joining us, \"Abducted by Quakers\" is one of my jokey bumper stickers, with a Spaghetti Monster icon (perhaps in silhouette) in the background, connoting a \"friendly to atheists\" vibe.\u00a0 I'm also allowed to drink beer.\n\nThe \"good without God\" demographic is quite capable of Friendship we've found, including when it comes to the more ouija board parts (not a seance) wherein we allow for movements of the spirit.\n\nContemporary depth psychology has explained how \"woo woo stuff\" may still happen in a post Nietzschean world (i.e. strongly secular, with fewer fairies and angels).\u00a0 Jungians presciently predicted \"abduction by aliens\" episodes might become symptomatic.\u00a0 Today many abductees have their own Youtube channels.",
