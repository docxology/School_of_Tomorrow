  "content": "This question is a no-brainer for most of us, given the national deficit (versus debt) as a percentage of GDP is still considered acceptable. \u00a0The US is not Greece. \u00a0Those measuring solvency as a concept need look no further. \u00a0Nations are debt payers for the most part, in [this New World Order](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/11/new-world-order.html), a handy source of interest income. \u00a0The name of the game is to keep it that way.\n\nThose seeking to debate for the other team will need to dig deeper in search of arguments. \u00a0They will have to argue in terms of ideals, suggesting, perhaps, that the [military-industrial complex](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/03/why-we-fight-movie-review.html) is a pretender, having hollowed out the original core and replaced it with a new operating system. \u00a0Instead of directly arguing the US is insolvent, this team might argue the US we have today is a fake, a facsimile, a phony. \u00a0\"Whatever it is we're calling solvent, it's not the USA\" could be their approach.\n\nThe latter line might perhaps gain some traction. \u00a0The life support on which Uncle Sam has been placed bespeaks a new chapter wherein nation-states in general have lost much of their believability as moral beacons, standing for higher ideals. \u00a0Certainly the map of the Middle East has become hard to draw, Syria having crumbled. \u00a0The game of asserting sovereignty by enforcing borders looks like a no win proposition. \u00a0In the meantime, the population flees.\n\nHow close are we to internal refugee displacements reminiscent of Syria? \u00a0Should we blame \"global warming\" for the shut off of potable water in the heartland? \u00a0Flint, Michigan decided to encourage residents to imbibe toxins, while many in Detroit are simply losing access. \u00a0Local government is walking away from the challenge of providing for the people. \u00a0The money the US borrows is more intended to pay for carnage overseas than to provide for essential services. \u00a0In that sense, then, \"the USA we have known is bankrupt and extinct\" (to quote a famous [Medal of Freedom winner](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/forced-march.html)).\n\nThe people do become restless when it appears the government is turning against them, now the servant of alien ideologies. \u00a0Reassurances that the Constitution and Declaration of Independence are somehow being defended fail to mollify. \n\nWill [the National Guard](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/05/from_tanks_to_rocket_launchers.html) bring Flint some relief, in the form of potable drinking water? \u00a0Citizens have been calling for that. \u00a0Instead, the US Army (and National Guard) chose to [conduct war games](http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2015/06/please-do-not-be-alarmed-3167774.html) in the area. \u00a0I understand why Jesse Ventura, former Michigan governor, is suspicious. \u00a0The presumed demise of the so-called [Posse Comitatus Act](http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/04autumn/felicett.pdf) gives our debaters more points to bring up, regarding the possibly phony nature of a post-US imposter. \u00a0Meanwhile, [in Flint](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/02/news-we-could-use.html), the free water filters should help.",
