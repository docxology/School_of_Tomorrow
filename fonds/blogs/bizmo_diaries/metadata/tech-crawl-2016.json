CBD = Central Business District; OGI = Oregon Graduate Institute.\n\nIn other words (back to \"polyglot\"), suggesting people \"language hop\" as if that were some trivial jump, is often unrealistic, any more than an English speaker might simply \"hop\" to Japanese or vice versa.\n\nThere's not much truth in the slogan \"learn one computer language, and you've learned them all\".\u00a0 Not really.\u00a0 They come in families, like musical instruments do.\u00a0 Learning Python does not make you a great [J programmer](http://jsoftware.com/) (APL family), though I've found them to make [a great combo](http://4dsolutions.net/ocn/Jlang.html).\u00a0 Both feature a strong REPL (a rich interactive mode or \"shell\").\n\nGeeks in this day and age will tend to identify as Front End or Back End as to their stronger skill set and area of most expertise.\u00a0 If you study Twitter awhile, you can pick up more buzz words, like Data Scientist and Machine Learning (additional skill sets, mostly back end, except the front end is about visualization and so is data science also).\n\nFront End means HTML / CSS and Javascript.\n\nBack End means what happens to those HTTP / HTTPS requests once received.\u00a0 Is the front end a smartphone app?\u00a0 Java, Ruby, PHP... Python.\u00a0 Many more languages play in this space, or define the frameworks that provide yet more layers of shared person-hours.\u00a0 Why reinvent every wheel?\u00a0 Speaking of which, I met an old colleague from Plone days (still a popular Python CMS), still with [CD Baby](http://www.cdbaby.com/).\n\nPatrick and I went by bus (4 going, 14 returning) and wound up [at Hophouse](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/09/working-it.html) with our visiting friend Mike, in his later fifties like Patrick and I.\u00a0 We've already enjoyed technology careers, against the backdrop of the PC to Open Source to smartphone revolutions.\u00a0 I've spent a lot of time in cube farms, often in hospitals, or other client offices, staring at screens.\u00a0 I'm still into staring at screens.\n\nThose initial waves of technology were sufficient to change the guts of Portland's economy in some ways, while in other ways much stays the same.\u00a0 I'm not the expert, but I've seen quite a bit of water under the bridge, had a front row seat on some of the action.\n\nSome of my journal entries from years gone by somewhat bemoan the [loss of CubeSpace](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/03/serving-buzz.html), a US Bank building facility on the east side (not the USB Tower) that helped with cross-pollination, important when wanting to help geeks not fall into over-isolating silos.\u00a0 Reinventing the same wheels over and over costs everybody.\n\nHowever the code schools, especially the ones hosting regular meetups, have helped provide synergy, in tandem with the user groups layer.\u00a0 The Meetup culture has taken hold. People from different walks of life discuss their projects and share skills.\n\nWithout a \"public square\" mentality, specialized knowledge becomes over-specialized to the point of semi-paralysis.\n\nA Renaissance fizzles into yet another Dark Age (YADA) when the kind of liberal sharing encouraged by academia (traditionally) goes away.\u00a0 The Free and Open Source movement was a direct extension of that tradition, per Richard Stallman at MIT, and the birth of GNU.\n\nOn a final note, I'd just been reading [Quincy Larson's impassioned plea](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/live-asynchronously-c8e7172fe7ea#.vne8bnd24) for \"more async\" i.e. less interrupt-driven open office plan setups.\u00a0 He's talking about what we call Personal Workspaces (PWSs) in the GST namespace.\u00a0 Study carrels.\u00a0 Cubes.\u00a0 Sometimes it's just office culture though, that needs to be addressed, if the floor plan is already fixed.\n\nOST was all about async and PWSs.\u00a0 Mentors gave focused attention to student programs, but not in real time while looking over their shoulders.\u00a0 Diagnosing program bugs on the fly is not typically how it's done.\u00a0 We'd encourage unit tests, and lots of them.\u00a0 I continue to work that in. \n\n\"Too much task switching results in lost productivity\" -- that sounds easy enough a proposition for the workflow architects to get.\u00a0 Human beings are not [ARM chips](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/wanderers-201696.html); they have their own specs.\n\nTech work sometimes means getting into a flow, almost a trance, like a novelist does.\u00a0 I good novelist is a first reader to get the story, concentration is required.\u00a0 Many novelists move to a beach cabin or some such, to get more work done.\n\n\"We need our software to work for us, not make us slaves to our machines\" -- another good one.\n\nI met up with PDX Code Guilders in one of the towers.\u00a0 I'm expecting to cross paths again at the [upcoming Maker Fair](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/09/maker-faire-at-omsi.html). \n\nHere's me after the Pi talk last night, modeling with said museum piece mascot:  [https://t.co/xC2MNabLvX](https://t.co/xC2MNabLvX) Pauling House on Hawthorne, PDX OR.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [September 7, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/773571784801185792)",
