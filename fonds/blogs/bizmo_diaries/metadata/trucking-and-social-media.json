  "content": "Some readers might be surprised to learn that I've long used the cab of the long hauler truck as my paradigm PWS (personal workspace) [in GST](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2021/06/tiktok-meets-gst.html), even more than the cubicle.\u00a0 The cab of a truck is a work-study space, and driving may take fierce concentration.\u00a0 You may also sleep in your study carrel.\u00a0The Trucker Exchange Program is a meme more than a program, even if I've taken inspiration from such as [Bob Textor](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/01/thirsters-gather.html), whom I didn't know well, but I joined his drinking party anyway.\u00a0 Thirsters at McMenamins.\u00a0He had to do with sensitizing the budding Peace Corps to the importance of Anthropology (the A in STEAM says no one but me).\u00a0 In terms of diplomatic corps, State Department types, I knew my dad of course, and [James Lambert](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/chauffeur-duty.html).Since I'm [propagating memes](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/05/truckers-for-peace.html) more than I'm administering program, I don't have to worry about taking credit for the rising self esteem among truckers, where \"self\" stands for \"role\" i.e. \"job\".\u00a0 The idea of a \"role\" is more appealing I think.\u00a0\u00a0Theater is it.\u00a0 World Game.\u00a0 A play within a play within a play... Disney beat me to it, with cast members instead of employees. We see that holds all the way up, to Top Mouse.The romance of [the trucking lifestyle](https://youtu.be/bLJ_KgSEFtU), if only as a glimmer in the Eye of Possibilities, is enough to keep the would-be future trucker generations circling.\u00a0 Let's make it a reality while we can. Like while we're not truckers, in my case, but active truckers may join us too.I'm some member of the movie crew in one scenario, following some experienced long haulers doing OBOR (Silk Road) or something in Africa, or Texas, or in Oregon or Australia.\u00a0\u00a0I help with curriculum around trucking, to provide continuity, helping to design a global exchange regarding work-study opportunities.\u00a0 The job (role) involves more tourism and diplomacy.\u00a0 We depend on truckers to work things out.",
