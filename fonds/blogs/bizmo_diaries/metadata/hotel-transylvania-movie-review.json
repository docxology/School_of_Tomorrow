  "content": "A very not-scary film about kids wanting to grow up and see the world, yet getting resistence from an older generation that has already seen a lot of the world and is wanting to protect and shield... but not stunt.\n\nDaddy Dracula (Adam Sandler) has experienced the nastiness of humans.\u00a0 He's a misanthropist for a reason.\u00a0 Who can blame him?\n\nVampires are clearly cooler.\u00a0 What's not to like about them?\n\nThe animation goes back to the roots, skipping recent recastings, and doesn't even try to make Frankenstein different from the monster.\n\nKid friendly, saw it at Avalon.",
