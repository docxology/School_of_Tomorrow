  "content": "I still harbor skepticism that learning to program has anything to do with becoming a professional computer programmer, necessarily.\u00a0 Not necessarily.\n\nOperating a scientific calculator does not make one a \"calculator professional\".\u00a0 Learning to drive does not make one a professional driver.\u00a0 Learning to program does not mean committing to becoming a programmer.\n\nLearning to program is integral with STEM generally, and with Mathematics (the M) in particular.\u00a0 Euclid's Method for finding the greatest common divisor is an algorithm, a famous one:\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/27304852296/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nTeaching programming as an after school elective, instead of merging it into the curriculum in satisfaction of mathematics requirements, is just dumb.\u00a0 Too retro.\u00a0 Too lazy.\n\nWe need math tracks that include programming.\u00a0 I've been [harping on this for years](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-pep-talk-of-my-own.html), as a part of some [vocal minority](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/pps-has-friends-in-silicon-forest.html) that's becoming more of a majority over time.\n\nYes, schools need to teach typing.\u00a0 Keyboards are not going away. That's an uber-important skill.\u00a0 Not just thumbing on a smartphone.\n\n[Providing smartphones](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/12/about-smartphones-again.html) would make sense though.\n\nHey, if your school does not include coding as a part of the regular math curriculum, is that OK with you?\u00a0 Do students have the right to protest?\u00a0 How about their guardians, do they have a say?\u00a0 These questions [have become political](http://bit.ly/1TJXlUD).\n\nYes, parents need a place to look after their kids during working hours.\u00a0 That's a primary function of the school system.\u00a0 Providing a safe, [interruption free space](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/07/pws-personal-workspace.html) to focus and concentrate is not necessarily what today's schools are about.\u00a0 You may just get a locker, and crowded classrooms.\n\nStudying is difficult in such an environment, if not impossible.\u00a0 Privileged students have their own rooms at home.\u00a0 On college campuses, one finds study carrels, often in the library building.\n\nIs mathematics education really happening in your district?\u00a0 Does at least some coding happen? That's a question worth asking.\n\nThis artificial division between \"computer science\" and \"mathematics\" in the lower grades (pre-college) is devastating.\u00a0 We teach \"function\" and \"variable\" in two separate dialects (in both algebra and computer science) and then leave it to students to connect the dots as they might (or might not).\n\nPython's top-level functions are pure gold to a math curriculum, as writing functions that take other functions as arguments is core in calculus.\u00a0 D(f), the derivative function, takes a function f as input and returns another function as output.\n\nComputer languages make such ideas accessible, concrete.\u00a0 So do we use them?\n\nIn an exclusive private school such as Phillips / Andover, those getting a privileged high caliber education might use Mathematics for the Digital Age and Programming in Python ([prototypical](http://www.skylit.com/mathandpython.html)).\n\nAs a society, we're apparently happy to share the new tools with children of the one percent (or less), while leaving the ninety-nine percent to wallow in their intellectual ghetto.\u00a0 Those seeking greater equality of opportunity might want to pay attention to such inequities?",
