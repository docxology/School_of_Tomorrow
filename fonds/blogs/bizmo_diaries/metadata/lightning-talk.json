  "content": "[KU adds, in 2013:] This is like one of those rants in Uru, some guy in an animated book, leaving a message in a semi-crazed, even frantic state.\u00a0 One comes across these recordings later.\u00a0 They lead you deeper into the mysteries of the (language) game. \n\nTo just bleep over the concentric hierarchy of polyhedra, based around a unit volume tetrahedron, is to me a terrifyingly cowardly decision, is a threat to our shared future ... \"How could humans do this to themselves?\" I find myself asking....\n\nSo then, when I go off and vent by making a little video suggesting I'm just dealing with quacks, readers looking over my shoulder can at least see where I'm coming from. It drives them crazy too (some of them) as I'm not the only die-hard in my little camp.\n[[math-teach, March 14, 2010](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2052948&tstart=0)]\n\nX-refs:\n[Forbidden Knowledge](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/03/forbidden-knowledge.html)\n[Back on the Beat](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/back-on-beat.html)\n[Incomprehensible?](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/incomprehensible.html)\n[Focal Points](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html)\n[Buried Treasure](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/08/buried-treasure.html)\n[Pointful Gossip](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/pointful-gossip.html)",
