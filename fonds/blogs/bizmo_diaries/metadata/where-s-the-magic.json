  "content": "Could it be that we intuitively understand, after decades of immersion in special effects science fiction, that we're ready for a next level?\u00a0\n\nWe see whole cities built and left largely empty in China, in part because skilled people need something to do. That's why we have militaries too, to stay occupied and in shape. But in shape for what? Are we talking about livingry or killingry?\n\nAre we in any shape to build new EPCOTs?\u00a0\n\nThat's an arcane way of asking the question, but not off target, as the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow had a modicum of LAWCAP support, meaning lawyer-capitalism seemed it might be ready to take the \"theme park\" concept to the next level, and indeed that's what started to happen. But then the effort bogged down.\n\nWho picked up the Disney baton, if WDC itself, post Walt, had to drop it? We've heard talk of Google's plans for mini-cities. But big tech comes across as pretty hard edged and predatory compared even to The Mouse.\u00a0\n\nBig tech is always scheming to prove essential workers are not really needed. Where's the magic in that?\n\nThe A in AI is for Artificial, which means Phony, Simulated, Unreal.\u00a0\n\nAGI (artificial general intelligence) is a weak opening, conceptually, as it's oxymoronic, as we're to understand AGI, when and if, is no longer Phony, but the real deal. \"Humans, not really understanding their own capabilities, have now developed these abilities in their machines\" -- that seems to be the plot. But how coherent is that whole screenplay?\n\nIt could be that humans are ready to implement more of what the design science revolution was promising, having faced up to their lack of integrity in so far failing to do so.\u00a0\n\nGiven the ubiquitous nature of media-making equipment (for staging, for recording, for sharing), the implementation phase will in fact be televised. So let's work on the scripts. Let's start with location scouting.\n\nWe will always need emergency shelter for people transitioning back to a more normal lifestyle, and one model is to bring the refugee camp to them.\u00a0\n\nDepending on geography, these could take the form of hospital ships, after a hurricane or tsunami for example. A smattering of hospital ships amidst a circulating convoy might be used to move millions over a period of some months. The system activates as needed.\n\nBut why not build an Asylum City for the express purpose of providing what military bases provide today: shelter for economic (and/or other) refugees, with opportunities for R&R.\u00a0\n\nGuantanamo comes to mind. Should Cubans build an EPCOT where Gitmo used to be? Or should Gitmo be preserved as a museum?",
