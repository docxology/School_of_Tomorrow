  "content": "Surprising how little discussion of a global grid we've seen in the 21st Century, in light of Peak Oil.\u00a0\n\n\"Historians will write:\u00a0 The building of a global grid at the beginning of the 21st Century was one of the key elements in the rise of the prosperity of the civilization that we know today.\"\n\nThe video below pointedly skips showing the most lobbied-for grid I'm aware of:  Alaska to Siberia, for inter-hemispheric transmission.\u00a0 I left a comment.\n\nThe main cause for skepticism?\u00a0 That humans are unable to get along.\u00a0 That's kind of the point.\u00a0 Global grid talk is for grownups, not for TV viewers trapped in their mostly-fiction media bubbles.",
