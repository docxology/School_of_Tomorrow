  "content": "I seem to claim to be a Pragmatist, enough so that I'm allowed to aim the John Dewey, Richard Rorty vector through Bucky and onward. What gives me that right.\u00a0 I don't know enough about Charles Sanders Peirce, for one thing, although I did go through an abduction phase.\u00a0 We had that ISEPP lecture...\n\nI'd argue with the premise though.\u00a0 I'm not the authority, clearly, I'm just into putting beads on a memorable necklace of connected thinkers.\u00a0 I do it for the benefit of my students, and I haven't said you have to be one of them.\u00a0 That's your decision.\u00a0 Lets be peers.\n\nMake your own necklaces, just make sure (friendly advice) you don't completely leave out some important beads.\u00a0 Like Newton (as in Isaac).\u00a0 Have I left out important beads?\u00a0 For sure!\u00a0 Why it's important to keep finding more teachers.\n\nDavid left some nice comments on this one (embedded YouTube).",
