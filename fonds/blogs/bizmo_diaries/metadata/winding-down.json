I introduced him to McMenamins, not far from the Hacker Lounge at the top of the Hilton.Josh works for ThoughtWorks in Chicago, which reminds me of Patrick's company in some ways.His talk, on the Hack track, which I'm attending, is about hooking to the bash and/or zsh shell and archiving one's command line history to the cloud [via shell-sync](http://shell-sink.blogspot.com/) (the tool Josh created) implemented with Google App Engine.  We're talking about a Python application, in other words.Josh studied Italian and art history for awhile, lived in Rome, Italy for six months, not far from Termini (the train station downtown).  We enjoyed comparing notes. There's also [a Quaker connection](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/unconference.html).",
