  "content": "A long running theme in these blogs, you'll find if you go back, is having edge case communities such as R2DToo and Dignity Village, willingly test pilot shelter solutions in a somewhat Darwinian filtering process.\n\nNot every new tent design or lean to is ready for prime time.\u00a0 But some are.\n\nGlenn got me thinking, as he had an elegant pan deck solution from his Institute for Integral Design.\u00a0 Just stacking pan deck might be an interim solution, a replacement for corrogated steel, already a staple.\n\nNot pretty necessarily, but able to protect.\u00a0 Blue tarps aren't that pretty either one could argue.\n\nDignity Village, which I've dubbed \"[EPCOT West](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/metropolitan-talk.html)\", is nearer the airport and is where the big Disaster Relief Honchos (MVP women and men) could get a peak.\n\nR2DToo is right downtown, on Bursnide, and could be the site for the new AFSC office, or one of them, if we play our cards right and stay in the relief business.\n\nGlenn is already seeking out John Driscoll, the Architect in earlier posts, to get some professional renderings.\u00a0 As for having a prototype at R2DToo, that would depend on finding some sponsors.\u00a0 We shall see.\n\nRelevant acronyms in this namespace:\u00a0 XLI = \"extremely low income\"; [XRL](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/ecovillage-update-synergeo-33452.html) = \"extreme / remote livingry\".\u00a0 You see XRL at base camp in the Himalayas, state of the art.\u00a0 XLI usually cannot afford XRL, but then who wants to be that remote anyway?",
