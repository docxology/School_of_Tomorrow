  "content": "Notes on: [Node.js Three Ways](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/topic/Emerging%20Languages) by C. Aaron Cois and \n\n  Tim Palk \n\nI played hooky in skipping the Python tutorial on meta-programming, which looked interesting.\u00a0 I hope Patrick will update me.\u00a0\u00a0 The presenter for that one was from Brazil.\n\nInstead I'm planning to study Node.js, also work-related in that a revamp of the company guts is expected in this technology.\n\nThe tutorial covered the same territory as a Python Django workshop in giving us hands-on use of an MVC (model view controller) web framework.\u00a0 The Express architecture is remarkably similar to Django in fact:\u00a0 a standard HTTP request-response pipeline with routing to templates, a modeler for mapping the database and so on.\u00a0 Meteor, presented in Act 3 is somewhat different.\n\nImportant:\u00a0 we're not talking about client software in a browser.\u00a0 Django and Express (the node.js framework we're looking at) run on the server, not the client.\u00a0 One of the breakthroughs for the JavaScript community has been its moving to the server.\u00a0 We're using [Redis](http://redis.io/) for our localhost webserver.\n\nThe idea of a project with an app.js and a packa[](https://www.blogger.com/)ge.json to guide npm (node package manager) in what dependencies to install.\n\nThe presenters have an ambitious workout planned wherein workers contend for a lock and talk to reddis, then later, mongodb.\u00a0 I've installed a lot of open source software in two days at OSCON.\n\nMatthew and Debra of O'Reilly School found me at the i18n table at lunch.\u00a0 We mapped out some strategy for tomorrow, when we harvest video clips for later promos.\n\nTonight, the Expo Hall opens and I'll find out where our booth is.\u00a0 Then:\u00a0 the big festival / party, always themed.\u00a0 OSCON is a well-oiled machine in many ways, a working formula.\u00a0 Why fix what ain't broke?\n\nI got lost in this tutorial thanks to [this minor issue](https://github.com/garann/node-for-frontend-devs/issues/2) involving curl and npm.\u00a0 However the presenters gave us the means to pick up anywhere by providing snap shots of the projects, with all source code in place.\u00a0 Useful.\u00a0 This is the kind of material I go back and study later, with my computer prepped as a learning platform.\n\nSocket.io is an interesting utility.\u00a0 No need to stick to port 80 and HTTP.\u00a0 That's for letting servers push to clients, such as updating chat windows with other users' strings.\u00a0 Meteor is a \"reactive framework\" for such an environment.\u00a0 Clients update each other in real time, like in a multi-user game.",
