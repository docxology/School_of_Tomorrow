  "content": "If you know your [Rudyard Kipling](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/05/wmbs-satire.html), you may be thinking X = White, but we're not so clear what that means anymore, ever since the Noah hypothesis was deprecated in favor of the dinosaur one.\n\nWe may still imagine some sub-species of overlord, tasked with taking on the great burdens, but lets not pretend to go by melanin content in the epidermis.\u00a0 Are they reptilian?\n\nTaking everything literally is the fastest way to close doors on most possibilities.\n\nRemember hallway monitors?\u00a0 If you went to a large school, you might have had experience with the role.\u00a0 The hallways of academia, like many hallways, have their monitors.\n\nDo they look for inappropriate cartoons posted on doorways.\n\nProfessors often showcase humor at the entrances to their sanctums.\n\nSome people profess about philosophy, having \"doctor of philosophy\" degrees.\n\nHowever the PhD degree has come to signify proficiency in high degree, minus any stipulation that philosophy is involved.\n\nOne could say the PhD degree is fiat currency, in becoming divorced from the \"gold standard\" of what it originally stood for (proficiency in philosophy).\u00a0 That's pure speculation on my part.\n\nToday was a religious holiday of sorts in my [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) of special datetimes.\n\nA \"[datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)\" is a type of Python object.\n\nThe religion in question:\u00a0 Church of the Subgenius.\n\nThat's the church of Bob Dobbs, who only appears to look normal (what with that pipe and all).\u00a0 Is he really an X Man?\u00a0 The church of slack is not about glorifying toil.\n\nDoes \"America\" want to finally become a country?\u00a0 With the border situation that open, with Canada, chances are slim, according to some criteria.\u00a0 But all talk of fences aside, doesn't becoming a first world nation imply some degree of caring for one's citizens?\n\nThe [Cowardly Capitalist](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/05/cowardly-capitalism.html) crowd is hoping to get Uncle Sam to protect them, both from competition abroad, and from citizens agitating for social services.\u00a0 The burden the C3s imagine assuming, should they be required to demonstrate social responsibility, just seems too unAmerican to them.",
