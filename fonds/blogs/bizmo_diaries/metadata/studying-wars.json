  "content": "Enough still unprocessed warring has gone on to last lifetimes.\n\nThe violence voyeur is always seeking some new spectacle.\u00a0 A younger generation comes along and asks itself \"how would I behave in wartime?\"\u00a0 Some seek glory.\n\nMaybe we don't need you to find that out?\u00a0 How would you behave if war were not a goal?\n\nPoliticians continually need assurance they'll be able to whip up war fever, and float a lot of trial balloons in that regard, just to see where they stand with the minions.\n\nThe minions, for their part, get bamboozled into one war after another, because they don't get the time or space to really study.\u00a0 They repeat the same mistakes, having too little time to learn from mistakes already made.\n\n\"Stop the world I want to get off\" is the cliche complaint people ridicule, knowing there's no stopping.\u00a0 However, without reflection, life stays shallow and superficial.\u00a0 What would it be like to let generations really learn their own past?\n\nWe have enough raw material to last many lifetimes.\u00a0 Do we really need to create more gratuitous karma for ourselves?\n\nSlow down and learn about what has already happened.\u00a0 Wouldn't that be a huge luxury?\u00a0 You could still tour, enjoy those cruise ships, explore museums.\n\nWe didn't need you to start new wars.\u00a0 Maybe you did anyway.\u00a0 You might have thought elective wars would get you elected? Is that what your donors told you?\u00a0 Were they paying you to get a war on?",
