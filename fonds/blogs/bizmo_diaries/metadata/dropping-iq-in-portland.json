  "content": "They say the creatives are leaving, force out by higher rents, as the narrow thinkers take over to pursue ever narrower lives.\n\nBut is that true?\n\nOne sign of a dropping collective IQ is the water system. \u00a0Portland had a variance exempting it from having to treat for a specific parasite, one that hadn't been a problem, until now.\n\nThe city decided to take its working reservoir system and replace it with an underground one, following instructions from The District, the lowest IQ zone in the nation. \n\nThe parasite has since been detected, the variance lost.\n\nThe Lloyd Center gutted itself of movie theaters at the Food Court level. \u00a0Concessions have left blank holes. \u00a0I guess the whole food court thing isn't making sense to people? \n\nHow can they shop until they drop?\n\nLet's hope I'm wrong.\n\nCarol spent the day at Lloyd Center, getting new glasses at Lenscrafters. \u00a0The moment she got home, without dropping them, the lens fell out. \u00a0Then she noticed the frame was cracked, who knows for how long.\n\nWe're driving back there now.",
