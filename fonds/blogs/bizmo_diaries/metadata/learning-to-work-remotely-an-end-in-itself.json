I remember Leela (then Lindsey) calling me in my Hilton hotel room from Kathmandu, to say she was OK.\u00a0 Hilton had taken over a goodly portion of the old Union Station in downtown STL, the site of our conference.\n\nIn those days, Michigan was giving some kids opportunities to take a distance learning class as an experience in itself.\u00a0 A special school had set up facilities in several metro areas, whereby the kids would be in a learning facilities, complete with snacks and exercise equipment -- but their teachers were far away.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThey could practice their Zoom skills, or the old timey equivalent.\u00a0 They could get ready for remote work.\n\nPart of schooling today, is around developing the skills needed to work remotely.\u00a0 Developing those abilities is an end in itself as well as a means to an end.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSome teachers specialize in teaching remotely just as some specialize in teaching gym or home economics.\u00a0 But then remote teaching works best for some subject matter, such as maybe history and computer science.\u00a0 YMMV.",
