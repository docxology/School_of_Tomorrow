  "content": "This film could easily work as a double feature with [The Power of Nightmares](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/power-of-nightmares-movie-review.html). The two films complement one another, plus feature some of the same talking heads.The storyline is uncomplicated: president Eisenhower left office warning the USA might become a [LAWCAP puppet](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html) (using Bucky's terminology) and lo and behold, that's precisely what happened.\"We\" fight because the war machine has a \"life\" of its own. There's nothing especially American or democratic about it. It wants to spread \"freedom and democracy\" but, being a heartless / soulless mechanism, isn't really qualified to do so.We've been scraping by with a phony USA for awhile now. Resurrecting a bona fide USA remains an uphill battle. Lots of heroic Americans have been fighting to bring it back.I'm reminded of The Matrix: most people settle for the illusion, don't even suspect they've been duped, soldiers included -- although some more knowingly serve as [quislings](http://www.answers.com/quisling&r=67).I'm glad this film is playing in Bagdad (so far [clandestinely](http://www.answers.com/clandestinely&r=67) i.e. not yet on mainstream TV, although that's coming).I'm glad the Iraqis are learning that the American people still fight (including with movies such as this one) to preserve a brave heritage, even though they too are a [conquered people](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4183720) in many ways, living in an occupied land.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/bluesforallah.0.jpg)",
