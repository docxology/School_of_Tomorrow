  "content": "Today's Ground Hog Day (film allusion) ascent of Mt. Tabor was a wide departure from the norm, statistically speaking: I took the bicycle.\n\nI've been riding this sturdy metal beast to one of my meetups, some miles away, not too challenging terrain.\u00a0 The route up Tabor is far less distance yet a lot more of a climb, and I decided \"walk mode\" would be permitted once inside the park.\n\nI have a hard time writing \"park\" without Westworld resonating, having just plowed through Season One start to finish, special features included, a Warner Bros. DVD. I'm between gigs.\n\nOn my way to returning it, I stopped over at Glenn's and shared the first two episodes, which he enjoyed.\u00a0 He knows where to rent it:\u00a0 where I returned it.\u00a0 We have one of those hard to find video rental places in our neighborhood.\u00a0 I got it back before the deadline.\n\nThat was yesterday.\u00a0 Today, having made it to the mid-level reservoir, I stood overlooking the city and marveled at the small birds frolicking in the foreground.\n\nAs fortune would have it, Glenn was on his way down so we walked and talked our way to Chavez, me wheeling the bicycle. Once across Chavez, Glenn staying east, I locked the bicycle to a rack and carried the helmet, doing a full bag's worth of supermarket shopping.\u00a0\u00a0 I lashed the bag to the back with tight bungies and managed to mount and ride back.\n\nMy day since then has been less of a physical workout, unless growing out my beard counts.\u00a0 I'll shave that today, and spend a few calories.\u00a0 I do appear to be slowly losing pounds as I continue the [No Beer Diet](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/09/no-beer-diet.html).",
