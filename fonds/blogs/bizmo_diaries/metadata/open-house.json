Willamette Week was the former occupant of these premises.  Furniture came from [OSDL's](http://osdl.org/) Beaverton office during the latter's recent consolidation.I invited Tara along, thinking she might get in on some interesting conversation, and we were not disappointed.  Gordon Hoffman, [a Wanderer](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/02/bruce-adams-presents.html) and adventurer, is our resident Indiana Jones.  He regaled us with stories of climbing out of an active Costa Rican volcano, at night, and of a WWI German army hospital, recently discovered almost completely intact.  He's headed to France soon, hot on the trail of a Medal of Honor winning uncle from that era, having spent the last couple years or so studying Chinese.  I was glad Tara got to meet the guy.My name appeared on the list of instructors with five years or less service.  I'm a relative newcomer on the scene, glad of the opportunities this [top flight academy](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3331684038533449838&hl=en) provides, both to students, and to careerists such as myself, willing and able to share skills and experience.",
