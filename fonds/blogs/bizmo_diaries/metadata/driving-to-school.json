  "content": "After a pit stop at Noah's Bagels, we tailed an \"official use only\" van down Hawthorne (heading west), and Tara speculated maybe it was a CIA van (some book she's been reading for school).I countered I didn't think such overt decals would be in line with the agency's style.  Better to just drive a raspberry-colored Subaru with a Princeton sticker and blend right in (joke).  Besides, look, it has a State of Oregon sticker.On the way home (heading east), I tailed an [orange Tele Atlas vehicle](http://www.teleatlas.com/) along Holgate (warning: slow vehicle), noting the four cameras and GPS device mounted up top.  \"Mapping your world\" was the company slogan, along with the \"live free or die\" slogan on the license plate.",
