  "content": "This series of three shows a process for making a meme, using side-by-side images in this case, and suggesting Before and After.\n\nAs we find out in Part 3, the Before side is actually flawed, and it's in attempting to reconcile the two tables (exercising a conversion constant), that I discover and repair the Before side error.\n\nAs we approach a roll-over from 2019 to 2020, it's customary to make forecasts or suggestions, regarding what we plan to take on in the coming orbit.\n\nAmerica in Philosophy\u00a0sounds interesting.\n\nThe whole idea of a \"new world\" was quite revolutionary.\u00a0 Some people imagined striking it rich.\u00a0 Others fantasized about utopian communities, including idyllic company towns or campuses.\n\nSome of that same kind of brainstorming goes on here.\u00a0 Could we have public schools that are also (A) boarding and (B) same-sex in addition to co-ed?\u00a0\n\nThese options abound in the private sector, but what if you're training to become functional in democracy?\n\nMy science fiction speculations are against a background of no public schools, given the American Transcendentalism I'm showing here is Verboten Math as far as the administrators are concerned.\u00a0\n\nHowever, when it comes to art history and schools of thought in architecture, for starters, there's less censorship (strict editing) to contend with.\n\nThat I'm casting this curriculum as \"high school level\" makes sense, but let's remember that level is incorporated within higher level mindsets.\u00a0 To introduce the \"concentric hierarchy\" at the high school level is to make changes in a parent or superclass, to employ and object oriented analogy.\n\nWays to carry the momentum forward through university level studies, such as in philosophy and engineering (e.g. tensegrity, flextegrity...), or even in a philosophy of engineering (cite Bristol, ISEPP), were pioneered in previous chapters, making it easier to work backwards, laying track coming from a future syllabus.",
