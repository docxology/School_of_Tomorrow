I empathize with diplomatic types who sense a lot of the investment banking discussions are no longer accessible to them.\u00a0 When it comes to planning future infrastructure, you don't want juvenile bomb-happy types in the room.\u00a0 They're too anti-social.\n\nDC has opted out of the civilian control structure, having militarized its foreign policy to the point of having no friends in high places anymore.\u00a0 This probably accounts for the specter of Papa Biden being cheered on by a tiny cabal of unilateralist ideologues with a track record of being wrong about everything. The dummies have been isolated to a set of swank addresses.\n\nMulti-polarity was an inevitable result, with business relationships forming around the ongoing task of subverting and circumventing all the dark ages sanctions being imposed by the lower half (the anti-intelligentsia).\u00a0 Europe has been buying gas from Russia, piped through Ukraine, throughout the entire misguided campaign.\n\nClaiming it's a terrible thing for Americans, that China and Russia are sorting out their differences, is highly short-sighted, and is mostly a mantra among the low-brows on cable.\u00a0 Americans have a role to play as well, when it comes to cracking down on unbridled, uncontrolled militarism.\n\nRegarding UAPs, we all know the adage that strong claims require exceptionally strong evidence, and what does not count as \"strong evidence\" is first person testimony from the security clearance crowd.\u00a0 We already have mountains of that fluff.\n\nHaving a top secret clearance is a bureaucratic rank, and does not automatically confer evidentiary weight.\u00a0 In practice, having clearances relates to sharing database logins, rumors, gossip.\u00a0 Claiming the super-secret nature of UAPs is what adds to their believability seems a kind of circular logical fallacy, an appeal to an evanescent type of authority.\n\nThe higher the security clearance, the more far-fetched the narrative, and the blurrier and less satisfying the actual evidence.\u00a0 That seems to be the pattern anyway.\u00a0 Stay tuned.\n\nSpeaking of the lower half of the Bell Curve (a snobbish tendency of Ivy Leaguers), I disagree that we\u2019re not having a pre primaries debating round. True, there\u2019s no League of Woman Voters staging an event on cable, and the corporate media aren\u2019t interested in democracy, but we have our new internet-based news services and the debates are happening daily, albeit asynchronously, with interviewers we already know.\n\nI've been tuning in RFK, Dr. Cornel West, and Marianne Williamson.\u00a0 Only Biden seems uninterested in the political process, suggesting he's not a serious candidate this time around.\n\nThe older more synchronous debating format was made for cable TV viewers, a demographic that no longer subscribes to real news.\u00a0 The corporate TV folks have opted out of democracy and want spoon-fed pabulum and rubber stamp candidates.\u00a0 Politics is a spectator sport for them.\u00a0 A debate would be somewhat pointless in that medium.",
