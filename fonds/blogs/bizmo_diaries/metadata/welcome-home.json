  "content": "I'm celebrating having my daughter back from Jamaica, where she'd been on a Quaker service trip, with other young Friends.Lynn & Co. picked her up from Seatac, though I'd been planning to all week.  This way, I got to cram for [my Martian Math course](http://www.4dsolutions.net/satacad/martianmath) up to the last minute.I've launched [the 4D thread](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2099792&tstart=0) on math-teach again, which won't be new to my readers on Synergeo.  Thanks to Joe for jumping in, giving me someone to spar with.I still think my idea for a fleet of bizmos, a lifestyle for roaming teachers with a control room for centralized dispatch, was a good one.  Someone should make the movie someday.I was somewhat dismayed that health care took precedence over ending the misguided wars, once USAers thought \"change\" was in the bag.  That doesn't mean I'm against health care reform, given we're all in the business of dying (civilians too) and could use the services.I was glad to see [the physics curriculum](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/07/einstein-omsi.html) tilting towards health care, and away from \"how to build a better bomb\" ala [Countdown to Zero](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/07/countdown-to-zero-movie-review.html) -- at least that was my take on the AAPT conference.My first class went fairly well today, even though we sort of dove into the deep end.  I appreciate these kids and their zest for learning.",
