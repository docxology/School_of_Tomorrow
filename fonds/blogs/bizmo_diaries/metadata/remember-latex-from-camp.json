  "content": "Hey high schoolers, [remember Camp](https://github.com/4dsolutions/python_camp/blob/master/PyCampNextLevel.ipynb)?What might look like super hard STEM, with all those Ramanujan Identities, turns out, from another angle, to be typesetting.\u00a0 As the typesetter for the mathematicians, you did not need a degree in whatever they were going on about, but you did need some skills when it came to arranging symbols.\u00a0 That's setting type.Thanks to Steve Jobs, who rescued business computing from being the unimaginative dullard monster\u00a0 Microsoft / IBM had in mind, we got highly developed fonts a lot earlier than we might have.\u00a0\u00a0The only other technology that might have saved us, from the dreary fate MS DOS had laid out for us, was LaTeX, the brainchild of Donald Knuth.\u00a0As it is, we got Apple LaserWriters and PageMaker and desktop publishing, and I got a job at CUE (Center for Urban Education).\u00a0 That's when I picked up some of my skills as a trainer, and to some extent a desktop publisher.\u00a0\u00a0I usually got high marks for working with people.\u00a0 Some of my lecture presentations might have been too weird for some tastes.\u00a0 I wasn't auditioning for prime time commercial television, let's put it that way.Anyway, coming back from Memory Lane:\u00a0 remember our Covid Camp earlier this year?\u00a0 Some of you might still be following.\u00a0\u00a0We didn't do a lot with LaTeX but we did explore Jupyter Notebooks, and their ability to make use of the LaTeX layer, a built-in JavaScript library I assume?\u00a0 Right, the MathJax JavaScript library.",
