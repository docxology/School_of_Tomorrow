Titty lived in the Blue House as an indoor cat, after [Moon Kitty](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/waning-moon.html) died.\n\n\u00a0She was gradually transitioned to an outdoor lifestyle, which she seemed to enjoy for the most part, after learning to defend her turf, although an altercation with some other animal was a likely cause of death eventually, the wound going undetected for too long (she did not exhibit behaviors of someone in pain).\n\nShe lived a full lifespan for an outdoor cat. She was\u00a0occasionally\u00a0recruited for indoor service during the [Great Rat War of 2011](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6605035513/in/photostream). \u00a0She had access to the basement studio through a tiny window during colder months.\n\nShe will be missed.\u00a0 \n\nThank you to [Joe Snyder](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6497556595/in/photostream) for a veterinarian's advice, and to\u00a0Pet Samaritan for the 9th hour consultation, where Lindsey and I took her yesterday on short notice.  She died peacefully amidst expressions of affection.",
