  "content": "I've been spending some hours in Lattice Gallery, as an apprentice to the maestro, Sam Lanahan, who is orchestrating a whole series of happenings and events.\u00a0 Flextegrity is the focus.\u00a0 My curriculum content has for some years capitalized on my having access to Flextegrity, in its various iterations, as an educational supply.\u00a0 You'll find lots on Flickr, as well as Youtube.\n\nGlenn has an amazing collection of books, many of them on matters mythological and archeological.\u00a0 He's well versed in a lot of this material, and admires Sumeria especially.\u00a0 Therefore I'm smart to consult him as I continue to explore specific stories, looking for raw material for contemporary storytelling.\u00a0 These days I'm focused on the [Pythians of Pytho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(mythology)) (later Delphi).\n\nNew to Glenn's collection: an amazing science museum gift shop type tome, featuring a plastic tarantula presented in layers.\u00a0 As one turns the pages, the central spider is built, plastic parts fitting ingeniously into place, held to the pages by plastic.\u00a0 The whole thing is somewhat delicate.\u00a0 A rowdy kid, prone to throwing things or stepping on them, might soon destroy this work of art.\n\nRegarding tarantula anatomy, I don't want to call it \"simple\" exactly, but it's a fine on ramp to the human system in any case.\u00a0 The heart is single chamber of that pushes blood by peristalsis (the way I think of it), whereas the lungs simply interleave hemolymph with surrounding air. The transport of oxygen is accomplished using a protein that's copper-based, instead of hemoglobin.\n\nYou may be wondering at my choice of topics here, a seeming blizzard of non-sequiturs.\u00a0 But then that's what hyperlinks are all about: providing context, where it might be needed.\u00a0 I've been looking at protein folding lately, rejoining the Linus Pauling generation in terms of my narrative.\u00a0 J. D. Bernal was a focus across two Youtubes.\u00a0 His lab was about using the techniques of crystallography to make headway on the problem of folded proteins (how does it work, what does it do?).\n\nHow I get to crystallography is through these \"lattice meditations\" (lattice in the sense of matrix and/or honeycomb) and all that somewhat Platonic geometry stuff I'm into.\u00a0 My work with Flextegrity is symptomatic of these fascinations.",
