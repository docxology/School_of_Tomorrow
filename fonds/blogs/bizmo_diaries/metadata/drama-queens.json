  "content": "Yes, this one is hilarious.  It hits so many movie-maker cliches right on the nose, the chords of melodrama.\n\nI think a lot of the Boomer generation thinks the world suddenly got a lot more tabloid at some point, as if the supermarket checkout lane world just took over one day and won't ever let go.\n\nThe above trailer captures that sense of claustrophobia, wherein a mundane nuisance becomes an existential threat of gun blaster proportions.\u00a0 Such a psyche tends to feed on itself.\u00a0 From merely dramatic, we move to melodramatic, then off the scale (the so-called deep end) to surreal.\u00a0\n\nHowever surreal could be fun with a Dali throwing the party, so I'm not saying all our reality TV shows must be nightmarish, even if surreal sometimes.",
