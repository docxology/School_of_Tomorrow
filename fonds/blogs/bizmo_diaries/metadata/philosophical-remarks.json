  "content": "Drat, I was up all hours sampling documentaries (browsing; always my habit), and missed getting the garbage out in time.\u00a0 I was awake early enough, but too preoccupied with nursing duties to remember this was Tuesday... I'm care-taking for a dog, on her last legs.\n\nAnyway, last night I came across the above (amidst some Mars rover and giant black hole videos).\u00a0 Lots of fun \"making math [look cryptic](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/exxon-math.html)\" -- the language of high priests no doubt, like the ones at CERN.\u00a0 I'm a Mario Livio fan, glad to see him [in action again](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/glass-bead-game.html).\n\nPhi and Fibonacci numbers -- a favorite topic.\u00a0 [Pascal's Triangle](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html) is also good (they're connected).\n\nThe mathematician who wonders if he's being radical in saying the universe is mathematics, versus the mathematics being just an attribute of same...\u00a0 when do they ever interview philosophers on whether grammar really matters that much.\n\nSaying it is mathematics sounds dizzying in its implications... a sense of wonder / vertigo is sometimes welcome in documentaries, I don't deny it.\u00a0 The thrill of a new way of looking.\u00a0 Grammar (in Wittgenstein's sense) is all part of the math.\n\nPhilosophical investigations:\u00a0 explorations in the geometry of -- the grammar of, shape of -- thinking (concepts, fitting together... or not).\u00a0 Will we condescend to see topology in the plot structure of a novel or film?\u00a0 In what dimensions, these meanings?\n\nSaying nature is mathematics, not just a user thereof, might help bring the humanities into closer association with computation.\u00a0 The book of nature:\u00a0 a running program (event driven?).\n\nFunny how when they turn to Pythagoras we're into the nightclub scene, and jazz.\u00a0 Not that I have a problem with that.\u00a0 I liked the mathematician-musician they interviewed.\u00a0 Talented, and with a message:\u00a0 studying is hard work.\n\nI'm just thinking how Disney applied a somewhat similar spin, way back when, in the 1960s.",
