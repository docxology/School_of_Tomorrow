  "content": "Glenn and I hopped a bus 14 to join Portland State faculty and students at a brown bag lunch event.\u00a0 We call it that, but no one was eating that I can recall.\u00a0 We sandwiched into the Harder House meeting room, pretty much every seat taken, John Driscoll standing and delivering his presentation.\n\nJohn took full advantage of his time, launching early into preliminary material about [Hausdorff Dimension](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HausdorffDimension.html) as computed with [a \"box counting\" algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Hausdorff+box+counting).\n\nApplied to facades, or floor plans, generic grids, one may compute its fractional dimension d, or, conversely, create such vistas with d as input.\n\nWhat would it mean to extrapolate random buildings within a fractal space, determined by a few hyperparameters?\u00a0 John is [exploring this question](http://johncdriscoll.com/2019/03/12/pin-up-2-2/).\u00a0 Could such a font of detailed fractal structures provide a kind of clay, which an architect could then sculpt?\u00a0 Iteratively?\n\nGiven my obsession with [spherical planet simulations](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/thinking-globally-in-2016-f01cd34466a6), my imaginary invisible landscape was of city-like planets.\n\nWhat if Roman Civilization were to be spread, by algorithmic generators, to create realistic vistas of cities never built?\u00a0 Where would the aqueducts go?\u00a0 Portland has some, from Bull Run.\u00a0 The terminal reservoirs were Roman-Victorian in flavor.\u00a0 I haunt the ones on Mt. Tabor.\n\nNow try another civilization.\u00a0 Add or subtract a technology.\u00a0 The models would seem crude perhaps, yet educational.\u00a0 Start with a river valley.\u00a0 Now picture it urbanized.\u00a0 Let the computer do the work, under the supervision of those with a strong sense of Feng Shui.\n\nI'm always in classrooms where the students want to enter into a multi-user domain together, while they're all in the same room.\u00a0 The game development platforms we use don't allow for this, but the competing commercial platforms do.\n\nMy math teacher brain, in the meantime, is thinking \"why not harness this desire to socialize through game playing (remember bridge? remember card games?) and let us play something closer to SimEarth?\".\n\nThat was a real game by the way, in addition to SimCity.\u00a0 In SimCity, we got to think about power plants, grids, city taxes, city services, property values and so on.\u00a0 What would [a Henry George version](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/12/wanderers-2009128.html) of SimCity be like I wonder?\n\nJohn has a kind of Machine Learning dynamic going, wherein software tools generate building after building, or block after block, with humans, perhaps licensed architects, registering aesthetic preferences.\u00a0 \"I like this one better than that\".\n\nIn this way, human judgement and algorithm-developed architectures each play to their own strengths.\u00a0 Algorithms generate a cornucopia of possibilities.\u00a0 Human judges cull the field, leaving only a few noteworthy finalists.\n\nMachine Learning algorithms know how to reshape themselves based on feedback, in the form of some error function to be minimized.\n\nThe idea that architects and movie directors could interact with fractal generator city simulators sounds completely realistic if we're talking about [the movie industry](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/03/portland-pacific-rim-center.html).\n\nYou want to fly around on such planets, but not necessarily build them, nor even draw them by hand.\u00a0 They provide context.\u00a0 They provide game boards.\n\nJohn and a long time colleague joined us afterward for lunch at Rogue Hall (Ione Building), part of Rogue Nation (the brewery). \n\nI took many pictures and was looking forward to folding them into [a next Youtube](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2019/03/portland-pacific-rim-center.html) (I've been doing them daily), only to find out my SD card was acting up.\u00a0 The computer wouldn't read it, nor would the camera after that.\u00a0 Unusual.\n\nI ended up reformatting, losing all the pictures.\u00a0 Fortunately, John's colleague [got it all on video](https://youtu.be/vp5OZ7P5t7I).",
