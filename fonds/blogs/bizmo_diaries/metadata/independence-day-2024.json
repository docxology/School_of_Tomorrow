The place was hopping. The waterfront now hosts a Ferris wheel. Is that permanent?I really enjoyed my time with the relatives, even if Urners are an obscure branch of the Hancock family by now, so it's not like I was recognized by all or vice versa. That's part of the fun of large family gatherings.Barb's dad was one of my grandmother Esther's brothers, [Esther Person](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/07/july-4-2015.html) being my dad's mom. Barbara has a beautiful family, and modest, well-appointed lakeside home.I got to overnight with Elise and Les, some of my oldest friends and Sydney's previous caretakers.",
