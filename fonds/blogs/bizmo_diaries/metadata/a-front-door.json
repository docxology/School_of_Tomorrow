The stereotype around polyhedrons is they're a topic in computer graphics, first and foremost.\u00a0 However consider leaving visualization to the imagination and coding only numeric changes in surface area and volume as a function of changes in radius.\u00a0 Using @property, we may inter-relate all three.\n\nYes, I'm talking about scale, which is turning out to be an important source of generalizations.\n\nThrough Windows, I provide a front door into PATH and STEM.\u00a0 Anaconda creates a space, after which [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/4dsolutions/SAISOFT/blob/master/OrderingPolys.ipynb) kick in.\u00a0 We learn Python in connection with its ability to sort polyhedrons in order by volume.\u00a0 The focus is on grammar, however in a way that fires the imagination rather than damps it down.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/29832307687/in/dateposted-public/)",
