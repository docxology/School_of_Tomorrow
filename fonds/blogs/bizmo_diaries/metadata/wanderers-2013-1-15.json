  "content": "Barry is the speaker tonight:\u00a0 How Cars Work?\u00a0 Really, fully grown adults getting together for that?\u00a0 Absolutely, that's Wanderers for ya.\n\nSome of us are \"retired\" but still busy all the same.\u00a0 Others of us are \"working\" (not the physics meaning).\n\nWe went around doing intros, per usual.\u00a0 Holden is back from the UK.\u00a0 DiNucci (NASA, Humanists), musician Bunce (Ret.). Phil just coming through (he actually works here in the building, with an office and everything).\n\nLinus Pauling lived here as a kid, got into chemistry.\u00a0 Electroscientific Instruments and Tektronix both got a footprint here too, along \"Asylum Avenue\" (one of its chapters), called Hawthorne now (after one of the doctors who started the Asylum, closer to 12th).\n\nIt's more about engines, which apply to boats, planes, trains and ships, not just cars 'n trucks.\u00a0 \"Automobile\" is any \"self propelled vehicle\" (translating literally).\n\nIn the UK, steam powered vehicles on roads gave way to trains as the paradigm.\u00a0 External combustion engines.\u00a0 The fire is outside of the actual engine.\u00a0 Sterling engine similar.\u00a0 Hence solar sterlings, which Barry doesn't know about ([Infinia's thing](http://www.infiniacorp.com/en/)).\n\nJet motor:\u00a0 fire on the inside.\u00a0 [Wankels](http://jalopnik.com/5921410/the-last-mazda-wankel-engine-has-been-built) (rare today).\u00a0 Hardly any turbines in cars.\u00a0 Chrysler showcased a few.\u00a0 They're air / fuel pumps, and in the process make usable power.\u00a0 A horsepower = what it takes to raise 33,000 pounds one foot, in one minute.\n\nDiesel, way important.\n\nBarry's personal memory goes back a ways, and he's done a lot of research.\u00a0 His dad was a machinist. All these fuels:\u00a0 peanut oil...\u00a0 He's explaining a jet engine now... 747... Some thrust through the cowling.\u00a0 Chrysler's turbine cars had a bearing that cost as much as the rest of the car.\n\nLong discussion of two stroke engines, their advantages and disadvantages.\u00a0 Barry understands them well.\u00a0 They were never popular in cars.\u00a0 Saab had one, a three cylinder two stroke.\u00a0 Then he diagrammed the four stroke cycle.\u00a0 Then two stroke diesels.\n\nI remember wandering through the science museum in Munich (Munchen) marveling at all the different engines.\u00a0 Barry is like a tour guide from there.\u00a0 Screw type blowers make an appearance.\n\nNew model engines are doing more to control the valves (variable valve timing, and lifting).\u00a0 OBDII (on board diagnostic version two) gives you hints about what to replace.\u00a0 Cam position sensor, knock sensor... lots to know.\u00a0 Lots of valve patterns too (Barry went through some history -- flathead, overhead cams, more overhead cams...).\n\nComputer controlled direct injection is making a difference.\u00a0 Focusing on the burn point more, with a little cup in the cylinder head... Honda, Mazda...\n\nWow, the Napier Deltic engine is pretty strange. Barry got through only about half his material. Maybe we'll do a Cars 2.",
