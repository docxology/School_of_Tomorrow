Is that really in the Pearl district?  I suppose so.The system was similar to Octoberfest's:  buy a mug (in this case a small plastic sampling cup) with redeemable tickets (I forget how many).The bottled beers averaged at about 3 tickets a shot.  I tried some [Achel Trappist Extra](http://www.sheltonbrothers.com/beers/beerProfile.asp?BeerID=35) first off, pretty stiff for a beer at over 9%, and quite sweet. [Hitachino Japanese Classic](http://kodawari.cc/engpage/kodawari/html/product_beer/jca.htm) (draft) was at the other end of the sweet spectrum (still strong).  Jolly Pumpkin's [Oro de Calabaza](http://www.jollypumpkin.com/beers.htm) had a piratically themed label.This morning on the Math Forum I described some elements of [an auditioning system](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1415104) for teachers wanting to make the grade.I figure Portland could be for creative teachers what Nashville is for musicians, a place to strut your stuff and maybe sign with a label, go on tours.",
