  "content": "[Edgar Applewhite](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html) was a Fuller fan early on, as a teenager, and worked with Fuller full time off and on.\u00a0 He also had a career in the CIA which took him to Berlin and Lebanon.\n\nEd and I got off on the wrong foot maybe, in that I considered him a fictional character at first.\u00a0 Dr. Fuller had this famous [mind / brain distinction](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/of-mind-and-brain-7b15ee64d4a6) wherein the brain was the filer and collator of special case experiences, which it ordered according to intuitions coming in from a higher source (mind).\n\nCosmic Fishing by this Applewhite guy seemed to capture this relationship, and I wondered if Applewhite was a pseudonym and metaphor for Fuller's brain.\u00a0 Later, reading a Futurist magazine, I saw his picture and talked myself out of my little fantasy.\n\nWhen Ed and I later [got to be friends](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/applewhites.html), I explained my misconception and I think it worried him more than offended him, as he was thinking I could be a key player -- but not if I was into harboring deep delusions.\n\nLater he coined the term \"[techno-invective](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/10/more-technoinvective.html)\" for a genre of writing I was into.\u00a0 Looking back, I'd say anyone defending Synergetics is bound to get caught up in technical arguments, but if it's a debate one also needs zing, hence the term.\n\nFuller and Ed had a somewhat rocky relationship at times.\u00a0 Even if one is conscious of the underlying psychology, that doesn't always mean smooth sailing.\u00a0 Rocky relationships are sometimes just the ticket anyway.\u00a0 I'm not suggesting Ed and I were always in sync either.",
