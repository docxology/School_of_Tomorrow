Andrews (W.W. Norton R Co., 1967).\nAnother link:\u00a0 Synergetics is focused on the question \"what is life?\" in some contexts.\u00a0 Dr. Fuller's collaborator, E.J. Applewhite, later wrote an entire book on that question, entitled Paradise Mislaid. As we hear in countless stories these days, \"you can't kill the covid virus, because a virus is not alive\".\u00a0 But then let's remember anthropomorphism has always extended to natural forces.\n\nIf I understand Fuller correctly, he didn't see physical \"meatspace\" as the same as life, which latter he tended to equate with the metaphysical in his U = MP equation (M for metaphysical).\u00a0 20th Century science was never comfortable with anything but U = P i.e. the universe is entirely physical.\u00a0 That the virus is a kind of biomachine, or biorobot, was for Fuller an indication that whatever life is, it lacks physicality.\u00a0 Does U=MP suggest a mind-body dualism?\u00a0 Philosophers will have these debates.\n\nI'll [reproduce my comment](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ej-applewhite/paradise-mislaid/) on Ed's book:\n\nE.J. Applewhite was a friend and I was aware of his process, albeit vaguely, in writing this erudite investigation into \"what is life, really?\". Having been a loyal collaborator on Synergetics, he was ready to contribute a magnum opus of his own. These chapters of his life were not disconnected, as the fact that a virus is just as much a machine or robot, informed Buckminster Fuller's view that the physical universe was not in itself alive. Discoveries in virology had proved there is no distinction. Life, then, was weightless and metaphysical. Per the review above, such thinking resulted in banishment. While Applewhite includes Fuller's views in his survey, he does not follow them blindly. He's content to invite us to the debating arena, and catch us up on the points that many have made.\nMichael Goldberg fit more data points with the capsomere counts, using a formula more elaborate than 10*F*F + 2 (* for multiplication). 1, 12, 42, 92... was not the whole story.\u00a0 Virology moved on, adding to our knowledge at a furious pace, as one of the most interdisciplinary of studies (especially once we factor in epidemiology).\n\nI might get around to correcting myself on the Youtube channel, which is where I was bringing up these counts in the first place.\u00a0 OEIS linked to my website (grunch.net) [under Links](https://oeis.org/A005901), and I like to show that off, by following the link to my virus page.",
