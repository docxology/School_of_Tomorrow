  "content": "Changing the headlamp of a car is not supposed to be difficult.\u00a0 It's a consumer vehicle.\u00a0 Simple repairs, like changing a light bulb, don't require a mechanic.\n\nThat was my experience today, though it wasn't the headlamp, but the front turn signal, underneath. I knew that, but tackled the wrong bulb in any case.\n\nBut then it looked like it might've needed changing.\n\nI rationalized the two trips to O'Reilly auto parts (not be be confused with the O'Reilly School I used to work at).\n\nEarlier in the day, Flickr was down and my Youtube was a lot about that, figuring out it wasn't \"just me\".\u00a0 Then service was restored and I was back to taking it for granted.\u00a0 By the end\u00a0 of the day, I'd decided to give up on that Youtube.\u00a0 No longer relevant enough to be worth all the post production.\n\nI made it to El Mercado, where I went with Dr. D. for Solar New Years.\u00a0 Last night, a went to Laurelhurst and saw Knives Out with Dr. T., but I've not reviewed it yet.\n\nYesterday I tested out the collision detection exhibit [I yakked about in the Youtube](https://youtu.be/rpAE_ogXKcE) from a day earlier.\u00a0 I'll likely use it again tomorrow as the curriculum is pretty much the same across the two zones (regional and anywhere).",
