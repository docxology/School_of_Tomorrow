It put up a good fight, sputtering on, showing logos, but ultimately the casement disengaged, revealing guts.\n\nWhat guns come with apps I wonder? \u00a0I\u2019m not even gonna bother to check right now. Telescopes and cameras do. Anywhere precision aiming, and recording, comes in\u2026\n\nToday Judy upgraded her phone, from an ancient flip model, to an entry level Samsung that\u2019s none too shabby. They shrink the price of the phone while piling on with necessary add-ons, like a charger, technically not needed if you have USB in your power strip. The shock case. We opted for not using protective glass. They were out of the low end version. Maybe later?\n\nWill I purchase and AW replacement, now that I\u2019m accustomed to \u201cclosing my rings\u201d (or not), or using the heartbeat app to track my bradycardia? My heart thumps along at a low rate but I\u2019ve been adapting, and so present as asymptomatic for the most part. The blood thinner I get after the pulmonary embolism episode some years back, is also the accepted remedy for my kind of heart beat (with flutter not fib).\n\nProbably I\u2019ll get one, costing some weeks at work (part time gig), but counting as a health expense for my one employee, me. If you wanna find new ways to do tax cuts, get more people seeing professional development, including tourism through conferences etc., as business expenses. Everyone is by default a sole proprietor of whatever they own, starting with a body (check) and a few devices (check). Capitalize on that!\n\nI\u2019ve tended to crack jokes about butt cheeks containing ample room for implanted devices, provided they\u2019re properly encased in squishy bio-safe materials. You\u2019d have apps on your watch and phone for these butt apps, some of which could be health monitors. I leave it to science fiction writers with medical and/or bioengineering degrees to let their imaginations run wild. A bun-based Theranos\u2026\n\nSydney the dog has been a pleasure to work with. \u00a0Another business expense if you ask me, if not a full partner and/or sidekick proprietor. Tomorrow we\u2019ll take our business over the Cascades in the company car.\n\nThe AW was a family hand-me-down from my youngest, Dawn\u2019s last, a Christmas present some years back. She\u2019d already learned the lifestyle so coached me expertly in how to integrate it into my routines. \u00a0Judy, a musician, agrees learning to use her new smartphone has \u201clearning an instrument\u201d similarities (muscle memory plays a role).",
