I introduced myself as \"a spy [from Bridge City](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/01/renewing-old-ties.html)\" but of course a lot of folks knew me already and welcomed me as one of their own.Given October marks a transition from a focus on Quaker testimonies to adjacent traditions in November, I suggested emphasizing Halloween as one of those bridge holidays connecting us to partially overlapping calendars ([the Celtic cycle](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-beginning.html) was already mentioned on the handout).A field trip the [The Gold Door](http://www.thegolddoor.com/) off Hawthorne (near Oasis) might be in order?  [Tibet Spirit](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/04/thursday-morning-meeting.html) would be another good one, and of course [The Dollar Scholar](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/04/treasure-hunt-on-hawthorne.html) across the street (thinking of stocking stuffers).Friends also seemed receptive to the idea of a field trip to [The Grotto](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/09/grotto.html) closer to Christmas, using [the manger scene](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/12/xmas-2007.html) and [Peaceable Kingdom](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Edward_Hicks_-_Peaceable_Kingdom.jpg) as our bridge to the animal world (the [Festival of Lights](http://www.thegrotto.org/events/lights.htm) includes a petting corral).  I also mentioned a certain python I knew, that could maybe visit the classroom sometime -- or we could visit the [Rose City Reptiles](http://www.yelp.com/biz/rose-city-reptiles-portland) on Division maybe?I also received permission to replace one of three world projections already on display in one of the classrooms, with a more apolitical [Fuller Projection](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/map/dymax.html).I spent most of social hour talking [AFSC liaison business](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/05/adult-education.html) with Multnomah's next prospective for that role, plus again met up with the young Pennsylvania crew newly moved to [our neighborhood](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/07/greetings-from-richmond.html), hyping the nearby [Barley Mill](http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=10) as a good place to have beers.Good seeing Pan's Zoe again, now a student at Lewis & Clark.",
