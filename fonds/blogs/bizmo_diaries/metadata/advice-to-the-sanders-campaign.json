start [closing doors on Bernie](http://www.globalresearch.ca/despite-cnn-propaganda-post-debate-polls-show-sanders-crushing-hillary-78-to-13/5482240), regardless of his populist appeal.\u00a0 His USA has too many inconceivable elements whereas they see Hillary as a known quantity.\u00a0 These journalists simply feel more confidant, more ready to write about her trajectory, whereas Bernie, like Donald, is [a wild card](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/anderson-cooper-opposing_b_8297944.html).\u00a0 They'd have to do a lot more homework, a daunting prospect.\n\nMy suggestion to the Bernie Sanders campaign is to take the edge off \"socialism\" by advertising how Americans practice military socialism with dignity and professionalism, co-owning, as a people, huge fleets of monster weapons, intimidating to say the least.\n\nSure, a percentage of \"we the people\" may feel suckered into buying a lot of [these toyz](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/10/bizops.html), aircraft carriers in particular, but hey, the Chinese and Russians build those too, so if there's a sucker in the room, at least the sucker is not alone.\u00a0 We have a fellowship of the ring thing going, a community of dolts.\u00a0 Hasn't it always been this way:\u00a0 stuck at the bottom of a gravity well in a pile of Fallen humans.\u00a0 Welcome to the Big Apple (in the sense of planet -- New York City a cosmopolitan mirroring thereof).\n\nThat's why \"making the world safe for socialism\" is really no longer a battle.\u00a0 We won!\u00a0 The Americans, Chinese and Russians all practice military socialism in one form or another.\u00a0 Each has a \"people\" (pueblo) that owns vast arsenals and feels patriotic about it.\u00a0 [Nuclear weapons, wow](http://www.4dsolutions.net/mycartoons/cartoon3.html).\u00a0 That's socialism in action.\u00a0 Rising through the ranks in the military is also a form of social mobility, a way of circumventing hereditary classisms.\u00a0 Again, all the weaponry states practice this from of ladder climbing (social promotion).\n\nSo whereas Socialism is in good shape around the world, Democracy could use some stronger defendants.\u00a0 Relatively few had a say in making these great decisions (e.g. to go whole hog into nuclear waste as a primary investment, which it now is for the foreseeable future), [including Einstein](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/07/einstein-omsi.html), who didn't think the US would actually go beyond testing.\u00a0 He regretted that the physics community had helped the rest of humanity come to the low IQ brink of self destruction through stupidity.\u00a0 Scientists in the main are not eager to see their knowledge exploited towards purely misanthropic ends, with those few Dr. Evil exceptions.\n\nOnce we take the edge off \"socialism\" then we can get back to thinking about both capitalism and democracy and how to best serve them and their flagship institutions.\u00a0 Bernie has never said we should not have private ownership or even secret ownership, which was the original goal of the LLC.\n\nWhen investors wanted to back risky ventures, starting in the early days of the East India Company, they wanted to limit their exposure or potential loss, without closing the door to future benefits should the risk actually pay off e.g. should one's proverbial \"ship come in\" laden with scarce hard-to-come-by luxuries.\u00a0 You'd get your share, some to keep, some to resell for a pretty penny. \n\nWithout some measure of control and self protection, a wealthy doctor, for example, would not wager on an adventure.\u00a0 Not if the widows and orphans left in the wake of said venture could haul said doctor before the magistrate as a scrooge and war profiteer who only faked being a doctor while making sure the war was fed.\u00a0 The public had to understand that his personal liability was only up to a point, and no further, plus all the good doctor's investments were philanthropic and socially responsible.\u00a0 Buying shares in \"Killing Commies Inc.\" went out of style in the 1960s, at least among the 0.1%.\n\nIndeed, buying shares in \"America Inc.\" has not been as trendy ever since the Imperial Presidency got out of control (JFK onwards).\u00a0 Truman saw it coming but couldn't head it off.\u00a0 [Allen Dulles](http://grunch.net/synergetics/gst2.html) was one of the chief perps, but only one of them.\n\nNot that the USA was really set up to be an empire in any constitutional sense -- it wasn't.\u00a0 A federation of states is more like a strong alliance.\u00a0 And that's where Bernie should jump in:\u00a0 remind voters that investing in America could be sexy again, if only she were a little more like Canada, a little less like a Bridge Troll.\u00a0 Lose the battle ax and camo, step into something less thuggish, and you'll do better in the ratings.\u00a0 Or should that be Donald's line?\n\nFinally, lets remember that workers of the world have as much a need to invest (their labor and its fruits, their savings) and limit exposure.\u00a0 A safety net is so important because it empowers the worker, like the rich doctor, to take the risk of retraining in some new skill set.\u00a0 That's like leaping from one trapeze to another in a circus act, and if the safety net is not there, why risk it?\u00a0 Better to stay stuck in a rut, trapped in a dead end job.\u00a0 The economy stagnates and dies when workers cannot afford to jump ship and take on new challenges.\u00a0 That's the flip side of limiting liability for the estate-minded.\n\nBernie is already strong on the need for a safety net, so lets help bolster capitalism and celebrate its embrace of Open Source, as a bridge to a more civilian-minded socialism.\u00a0 Given the military is already socialized, lets focus on the benefits to the civilian sector, of 21st century engineering.\u00a0 That's where we have many capitalist celebrities eager to talk on TV.\u00a0 Some of them would be happy to promote Bernie.\u00a0 [Silicon Valley](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/03/occupy-silicon-valley.html) is not pre-committed to the Republicans I don't think, despite the reputation of Venture Capitalists.\u00a0 Stay tuned.",
