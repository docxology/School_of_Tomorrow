  "content": "The joke about 5G is that \"it isn't about mind control\" whereas of course it is.\u00a0 Not in a tin foil hat sense, but in a marketing sense. The FCC needs you to be OK with 5G, as does Qualcomm, and really, what's your problem with it?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDo you intend to obstruct the right of free peoples to make use of those frequencies?\u00a0 We already use them, for cooking.\n\nThe PR maze makes it look like the anti-5Gers have a problem understanding the difference between nuclear bomb type fallout radiation, and the kind we all use to listen to the BBC on FM.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n5G is way down below the visible spectrum with radar, microwave, and other ice cream melting frequencies.\u00a0 5G has nothing to do with gamma rays.\u00a0 The G does not stand for Gamma, you sillies.\u00a0 You conspiracy theorists who think people haven't done their homework.\n\nThat other animals besides humans might already be making use of invisible frequencies is in many circles considered balderdash, except in the sense that loud sonar or rocket blasts could break the hearing and peace of mind, to the point of self destruction, of various species.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIf SpaceX blasts the surrounding turtle space with trauma and drama, it's not a given the sacred species will \"bounce back\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe science will tell us, if and when, but by then it may be too late.\n\nResearch seems to show that animals brought up in the presence of 5G suffer no ill effects presuming just a trickle of power.\u00a0 Blasting power through devices not meant to handle it, usually causes damage, to phones and IoT devices included, not just nervous systems (wiring is wiring).\u00a0 \n\nEar drums get damaged when subjected to 2G rock and roll (when the giant amps and speakers made their debut, and kids stood right up next to 'em).\u00a0 Stand right in front of a radar at the wrong time, and you're asking for trouble.\n\nBut are all the concerns around next generation telecommunications owing to concerns about brains in a radio frequencies ocean?\u00a0 Not at all.\u00a0 Other paranoias run just as deep if not deeper.\u00a0 Stay tuned.",
