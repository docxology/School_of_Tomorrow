  "content": "More different kinds of commercial was what the Hunger Project was about. \u00a0We're conditioned to respond within a sphere of [familiar insignia](http://grunch.net/archives/38), from stadiums to airport concourses, but where is the brand about ending hunger? \u00a0Are the big religions really leading that charge effectively? \u00a0Governments?\n\nEnter Food Not Bombs. \u00a0Stop the waste. \u00a0Close the loops.\n\nThe FNB event near Oaks Park was not any of my doing. \u00a0Lindsey checked it out and I'm not begrudging anyone's participation, just trying to put limits on what Blue House gets credit for. \u00a0I've got my curriculum writing, [Lindsey her music](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/04/gotta-have-coffee.html), everyone else has moved digs, except of course family members, soon to increase in number. \n\nCarol is involved in many a global network, including WILPF's, which have proudly included Ava Helen Pauling among others. \u00a0Linus Pauling is a local hero, a symbol of so much that is best about people. \u00a0Carol has been bearing a pretty bright torch. \u00a0I look forward to hearing more about what [Linda Richards](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/09/wanderers-200892.html) has been up to. \u00a0Trevor's book on Portland Memorials has the [Walk of the Heroines](http://www.woh.pdx.edu/) at PSU, where mom's name is memorialized, with those of others she knew.\n\nDeath from malnourishment: \u00a0a broad spectrum of conditions, including simply a lack of good food, but not limited to that. \u00a0Eating to much of the wrong thing will take their toll. \n\nYou may not know how to shop and live affordably, adding unwanted pounds simply for lack of easy-to-acquire skills, but who has the time. \u00a0You have your own treadmill. \u00a0\"Variations in routine\" sound like a cake walk when you're not stuck in a rut.\n\nIn our [distance education model](http://oreillyschool.com/), you can start and stop at will, with no metronome set by some meeting of \"classes\". \u00a0The concept of \"attendance\" is muted. \u00a0We inherit from the correspondence schools, but in some sense that's just a mixin parent class, not our root. \n\nAs a metaphor for life we each \"build a portfolio\" and to some extent authentication is of concern i.e. is this really your own work? \u00a0The question has to do with expected results, along with unchallenged claims. \u00a0\"Any\u00a0liens\u00a0on the property?\" the lawyers might ask? \u00a0Even easements can be a problem.\n\nAs Chris, one of [our newer Wanderers](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/06/wanderers-summer-retreat.html) points out, so-called successful people are not really \"self made\" so much as produced by others. \u00a0This jibes with my own experience of co-dependent origination, the core dharma of many a Buddhist sutra. \n\nYou'll have had your champions and been a champion for others. \u00a0In [Homer Davenport's](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/04/our-hero-mr-ed.html) case, the Arabian horses brought him reflected glory, a two way street. \u00a0Your champions aren't always humans.\n\nDavid Koski, myself, George Hart, other members of the Poly list (which I am not on), are all registering respect and positive sentiments towards the late [Mario Marin](http://www.mariomarin-poliedros.com/), a pioneering artist.\n\nIt is with sadness that I also join all other members of our polyhedral list on the death of Mario. \u00a0He certainly will be remembered for his profound contributions to the lore and lure of polyhedral creations.\nwrites [Magnus Wenninger](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/06/visiting-geometer-priest.html), another great in that ballpark.",
