[Steve Holden](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/07/oscon-2015-begins.html), whom Trisha asked about, is now working in \"official London\" on Christopher Street.\n\nTrisha teaches the kind of maths needed by pharmacists, lots of measure conversions, getting amounts exactly correct, lots of stuff I don't know about. \n\nTrisha was blown away by the poetry grand slammer below. \u00a0I'm glad she clued me in. \u00a0She introduced me to Logan and more of her extended household at a favorite neighborhood public house.\n\nThis was free pool night (as in striking a small white ball with the end of a long stick, on a green table, not swimming).",
