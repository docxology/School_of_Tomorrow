  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/5236864896/in/album-72157625538952986)\nPosting to the Facebook Epistemology group:\nIt\u2019s not \u201cfactually true\u201d in any epistemological sense that political ideologies span a one dimensional spectrum from far right to far left.\u00a0 These directions (relative to whom?) are arbitrary to begin with, and come with a built in bias. \u201cRight\u201d also means \u201ccorrect\u201d whereas \u201cLeft\u201d inherits the historical stigma of \u201csinister\u201d, from the Latin \u201csinistra\u201d. So there\u2019s a thumb on the scale right from the outset. Bad design from the get go.Tangential aside: It\u2019s like \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnegative\u201d in mathematics, hardly neutral terms. Only the positive three vectors in the XYZ system get to be \u201cbasis vectors\u201d whereas the negatives are always secondary, even if you can\u2019t tell them apart in terms of the work that they do.Biased labeling aside, the idea that a simple linear spectrum is adequate for modeling political ideologies should be met with well-founded suspicion, especially in this golden age of data science (apparently). Who knew statistics would be overnight transformed into the sexiest of professions by the brilliant success machine learning?In data science we have something called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) which adjudges, by mathematical techniques, what we might call the \u201crgb colors\u201d or \u201cfundamental properties\u201d of any space. To each component corresponds a dimension, in some n-dimensional Hilbert Space.PCA involves not necessarily knowing in advance how many dimensions we might really need. To specify in advance: only one dimension, is to prevent the PCA algorithm from optimizing.\u00a0 In other words, \u201cleft versus right\u201d is not only poor terminology (because biased), it\u2019s bad science (data science). Too few dimensions to not a cogent model make. Even astrology had more dimensions, not forgetting the superseding Myers-Briggs.And yet political scientists put up with it, do not fight back. That\u2019s akin to the situation in anthropology, where the pros know we don\u2019t have \u201cfive races of man\u201d (black, white, red, yellow, brown), that\u2019s so much bogus BS, and yet corporate sponsored pop culture is allowed to stay uncorrected. A great dumbing down is allowed to persist.So what\u2019s my ultimate conclusion, in light of this rant?\u00a0 Resolved: that English, without major modifications, is a garbage language, not suited to logical or rational thought. Let\u2019s debate.So many of core English concepts are so obviously poorly conceived and corrupt (computer science: buggy). Should \u201cgood philosophy in English\u201d be considered an oxymoron then?\u00a0 I wouldn\u2019t go that far. I think English in the right hands is still capable, as a language.\u00a0 But by default, English left to its own devices, is not suitable for scientific communications. That\u2019s why education in professional grade English is so important, right?[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbQ4t8uuSJqNKy6cOoWfosSzmhF5wihQ6NeESm1B5IDKAakY94T4NLV72r4NQwoK4HBS-gDulcQNeqoy89wk3mmSDDHJMFItWQ0BWXFZgHe72jYrFbiamF_3b-1SAciY0q5C51otGmvg2UJBUfbUGIYhI2D3pb14RufAgiiBOeuGwUzmJFF-38/s931/Screen%20Shot%202024-10-04%20at%208.39.47%20AM.png)",
