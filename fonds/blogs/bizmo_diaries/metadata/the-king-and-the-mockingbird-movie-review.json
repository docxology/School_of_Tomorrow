  "content": "The King and the Mockingbird (English title for a film from France), is really not that old: \u00a01980, my year to finish a four year college. \n\nAnd yet I'd not heard of it until now, a missing puzzle piece in some ways.\n\nThe mockingbird, a caring father of baby birds, [speaks truth to power](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/03/remembering-baryard-rustin.html), an insufferable King who has a crush on a much younger woman who's already Facebook Friends with a chimney sweep (read: \u00a0lower class dude) her own age (and type).\n\nThe King plans on asserting white privilege in true royal style, only to be stymied by a bunch of sensitive lions riled to rebellion by a blind yet hope-filled musician, moved by the mockingbird's sly tale telling.\n\nThe world Paul Grimault creates is awesome, complete with improbable elevators and a giant robot, [shades of Code Guardian](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/08/adventures-in-teaching-and-driving.html), all in a swoopy \"[New Swine-stein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle)\" castle-like setting (with allusions to Mad King Ludwig cite [Royal Babylon](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/10/afsc-support-committee.html)).\n\nIt's a modern police state in a nutshell, with a dictator run amuk. \n\nWhat a great anthropological study (and spoof) of a theoretical ant hill (of the kind humans build). \u00a0I'm so glad I got to view this restored (and dubbed) version.",
