Then came a knock at the door and there was Lindsey Walker, whom I'd not seen since last year.\n\nWe had tea on Division at our usual spot where she showed me pictures of her new place, austere and functional, in Kathmandu. Turned out she was curious about Wonder Woman also.\n\nProbably the Bible families won't be too bent out of shape as the somewhat Bollywood style Greek mythology reiterates the Paradise Lost theme of Lucifer, jealous of God's love for his homely creature, Man.\n\nAries (lets call him Mars) is a died-in-the-wool misanthropist, and what is War (a favorite form of theater) if not misanthropic?\n\nWonder Woman is on the side of good as we slide back in time to the World War One era.\n\nMars is having a field day and the job of these Amazon women is to defend humans, innately good, from his manipulating.\u00a0 Or so the children are told.\n\nAs Wonder Woman grows wiser she realizes Mars is a pretty good prosecuting attorney and humans somewhat deserve the fate they choose for themselves, and indeed they're somewhat loathsome.\n\nLindsey and I agreed it was all on the corny side, but then we're talking about a comic book after all.\u00a0 Serious-minded theologians are not a primary audience.\n\nWe're more into learning about puberty and putting our childhood toy stories to bed.",
