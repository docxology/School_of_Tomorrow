Volume changes as a third power of the scale factor, surface area as a second power.The remainder tet is what's left when you build a T-mod recursively from phi-scaled smaller versions of itself.  [The T-mod](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/tmod.html) is 1/120th of a rhombic triacontahedron.Note on nomenclature:  the E-mod has the same angles (shape) as the T-mod in Synergetics, but a different surface:volume ratio as it's slightly bigger.  The T-mod has the same volume as the [A- and B-mods](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/modules.html) in [Fuller's concentric hierarchy](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/volumes2.html) (1/24).  David does not feel bound to use this accounting system however.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/tableau.jpg)a [PKL](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/08/portland-knowledge-lab.html) tableauFrom PKL we walked to nearby Lucky Lab for brews then headed back to Meliptus for a higher tide experience, which included an interesting tour of George's decommissioned army tug boat (George, a WWII pilot, is 81 and lives on this tug).[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/george.jpg)David and George discussmechanical mattersaboard George's tug New Era",
