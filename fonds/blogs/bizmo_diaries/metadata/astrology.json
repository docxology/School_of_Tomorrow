I picked up a free copy at the new Theosophy Library digs out on Beaverton-Hillsdale highway that time. I mean to go back the lifetime register for library privileges.\n\nLets start out by mocking the idea that celestial [sic] bodies program human behavior and/or thinking, in the sense of influence or affect, noting there's no evidence of encrypted information in moon beams (bounced sun beams). There's no evidence for an encodable region in the brain that would be especially sensitive to coded starlight.\n\nNow lets say that was a straw man cosmology, and that the way cosmic bodies influence our daily lives is right before our eyes: through astrology.\u00a0\n\nThe very language, of typifying personality traits (e.g. stubbornness, control freaky...) by birth chart, and/or putting world events against a backdrop of this or that cosmological state, has been uber-influential in human affairs, self evidently, without any appeal to \"secret\" physics.\n\nNow that we've settled on this shallow truism, that astrology is influential, lets also remember that people have used it to encode some reliable astronomical information.\u00a0\n\nAstronomy would not be where it is today without astrology as a runway long enough to launch its bulk, as an instrumentally endowed discipline, able to theorize about and detect the likes of neutron stars.\n\nA neutron star forms when the atoms are no longer able to put up a fight, as protons with a defensive shield of electrons, a perimeter, a fence.\u00a0\n\nThe crushing force of gravity overcomes the compressive push of electromagnetism at these extremes, whereas at most frequencies gravity is as diaphanous and evanescent as light pressure, relative to magnetically charged electrochemistry.\u00a0\n\nThe end result is a ball of neutrons, one could say a giant atom of a kind, and its radial broadcast impact on the environment is not negligible. We detect them as pulsars and see them as rapidly spinning, perhaps at over 42K RPM.\n\nCurrent cosmology suggests that neutron stars, if sufficiently massive, further collapse into quark stars and then black holes, potentially in a kind of Jitterbug transformation (a squeezing inward).\n\nThe link I'll make here is to \"epigenetics\" in the context of the Synergetics Dictionary in particular. Astrology would be part of the epigenetic feedback loop whereby genetically encoded biological patterns get channeled forward in time by mental processes associated with civilizations.\u00a0 Humans self program such that their more slowly evolving biological avatars get involved in space travel and/or scuba, with aerospace in between.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/53168643981/in/dateposted/)",
