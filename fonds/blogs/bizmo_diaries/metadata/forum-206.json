  "content": "I'm back to posting to the Math Forum a little bit.\u00a0 I've contributed thousands of posts to Forum 206 over the years. I'm glad Drexel University gave us an opportunity for public debate.\n\nAs I indicate in [my latest comments](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=10074514), I have alternative ways of covering the mix of topics, which were maybe a sign of the times. Certainly \"learning to code\" has grown in importance, as a PR topic.\n\nI pay for the 4D Solutions domain out of my own pocket. No one has sponsored me. There've been tie-ins with the Bizmo idea.\n\nI've spent a lot of time working with David Koski and others, with what I consider one of [the main focal points](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html): a way of building spatial geometric fluency by leveraging the work of Buckminster Fuller.\n\nI've been meaning to get back to the Linus Pauling Archives at OSU to see what correspondence I might uncover between Linus and Bucky. I imagine there must be some.",
