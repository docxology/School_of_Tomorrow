  "content": "This film [recalls Kinsey](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/kinsey-movie-review.html) in taking an anthropological view.\n\nThe casting is almost too perfect, to where it becomes a cartoon, and in that sense a divine comedy.\u00a0 The Catholic priest is top of the line, if not over the top, in that regard.\n\nThe film is structured as one long confession, but ultimately not a confession of guilt.\n\nThis husband of the therapist has an interesting role.\u00a0 You'd probably need to be a philosopher to have that be your wife's day job.\u00a0 We only see him blowing up once, and even then it's fairly low key melodrama, and she gets to read the letter anyway.\n\nHe's in the church with the rest of 'em, cleans up well.\n\nI like that they have her making tapes, reflecting into her 1980s cassettes.\u00a0 It's not set in the present.\u00a0 That's something of a relief.\u00a0 He lived to be about my age.",
