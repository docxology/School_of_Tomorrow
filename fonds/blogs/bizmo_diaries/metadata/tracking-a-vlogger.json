  "content": "I thought she totally caught the train experience, in her low key way.  Nervousness about missing one's stop.\u00a0 Trains delayed.\u00a0 Trains being right on time.\u00a0 Scenes out the window.\u00a0 The car interior.\u00a0 Reflections.\n\nThe trope of getting ready to leave one's country, and saying good bye to cities in past videos, contains instant and seemingly infinite nostalgia for what now is, not the future.\u00a0 I find her fascination with the mundane matches my own.\n\nFreedom is to exult in nothing special, which is ever special, not to mention ubiquitous.\n\nI've followed this channel for awhile now, and have said in the comments I appreciate the editing.\u00a0 The story is bravely autobiographical, and offered with an open heart.\u00a0 I know she has a ton of fans.\u00a0 Count me one of them.",
