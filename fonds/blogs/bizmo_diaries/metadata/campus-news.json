  "content": "Hey there patrons, investors, alums, future students, faculty...\n\nI'm sure you're all eager beavers (Oregonian expression?) and want to learn everything about the roof of my house.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThat's been the order of business this morning, as in:\u00a0 why doesn't it leak?\u00a0 The High Powered Homes says it's three tab, common in the 1990s.\u00a0 Not what's called \"architectural\" which is more the standard today.\n\nUnderneath though, is an older higher grade shaker.\u00a0 Like they don't make anymore.\u00a0 That accounts for why I've gotten away without re-roofing for this long.\n\nThe remodel to make this more like a Linus Pauling House, non-profit owned and operated, open to sojourning faculty, students, would include a new roof with more ventilation, other interior changes.\u00a0\n\nThe old metal and vinyl kitchen is still fully operational. What would the 2 Dickinson people do?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI learned some of my adult livings skills at 2D.\u00a0 The group home scene.\u00a0 At Princeton University.\u00a0 Lets do that again.\u00a0\n\nSo the estimator is sitting out in his truck.\u00a0 We've been through the different grades of roofing, economy, performance, and high performance.\u00a0\n\nThe Owens Corning solution, backed by a transferable warranty, is an entire construction system. Their platinum installers get high marks for durable solutions.\u00a0 High Performance Homes is one of those platinum installers.\n\nI'm saying: hey, where's the university in this picture?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nHousing Services kinda sucks when you add all the solutions and divide by eight billion.\u00a0 Let's talk about Food Services.\u00a0 Welcome to the Global U, right?\n\nSo at the other end of Blue House would be these (sometimes remote) learning center experimental communities of tomorrow, that work with future prototype high tech and invite tourists, inspectors, auditors, critics.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWe're not trying to disappear behind some occult fog here.\u00a0 The goal is transparency, more than you're used to perhaps.\n\nThe job would be in the ballpark of $20K < re-roof < $30K.\u00a0 However, before tackling the roof, I need to get the trees and shrubbery cut back from the house.\u00a0 Another stimulus might be needed.\n\nMe on Facebook:\n\nI had the roof looked at today. It's not leaking, just I lucked out that it has a good cedar shake roof under the 1990s 3-tab (I learned some new jargon). Just collecting numbers. I'm jealous of the Pauling House being owned by a nonprofit. How do I get to be a nonprofit too?",
