  "content": "The embedded Youtube is Part 4 of a five part series, which I've watched before, and viewed again yesterday, before sharing it to Facebook.\n\nFuller is adroit in thinking metaphorically, but for most of us, science is a literalist affair, with the true grounded meanings. Metaphors are for embellishment, not for supporting weight.\n\nHowever, Fuller's Universe is light and airy, highly tensile, remarkably devoid of brute force strength or forcing more generally.\u00a0 He flits about, always resecuring his own technology, a synergetic language as dense as Heidegger's.\u00a0 Equilibrium is the name of the game, but in a Universe intent upon success for its humans.\n\nI've been endeavoring to shed some light on what Fuller branded as \"the geometry of nature\", a claim for which he takes flak. Does XYZ ever make such a claim?\u00a0 Is the counter-position that geometry is merely a human invention?\u00a0\n\nHis scaffolding is the IVM (\"octet truss\"), a pattern found in nature for sure (CCP, FCC), with volumes 1 and 4 respectively.\u00a0 Rectilinear patterns don't go away, as we've seen in C6XTY (another IVM-related space-frame design). His paradigm cubes have volume 3.\n\nBy some reckonings, synergetics offers but a small tweak at first, with this shift to tetravolumes, resulting in some simplifications (more whole number volumes).\u00a0 Where that leads next is the next question.\u00a0 Fuller points to intuition, but has intuition served him well?\n\nDoes 90 degree precession really pick up where 180 degree gravity ends?\u00a0 He seems to think the Earth's orbiting and axially rotating are resultant behaviors given the Sun's pull.\u00a0 Textbooks suggest a primordial kineticism for which \"gravity\" should not be blamed.\u00a0 \"Critical proximity\" is where the changeover occurs.\n\nStuff \"falling in\" is not the usual thing with gravity, according to Fuller, as the whole-unpredicted-by-the-parts is more like stuff \"wandering\" (not \"falling in\").\u00a0 The effect of bodies in motion on other bodies in motion seems chaotic and complex.\u00a0 Is he seriously questioning Newtonian dogmas?\n\nI get the tetravolumes meme and have taken that to heart, and when it comes to \"metaphysical gravity\" I see \"precession\" as Bucky means it.\u00a0 Metaphysical == Metaphorical?\u00a0\n\nHe dives into speaking very specifically about literal gyroscopes.\u00a0 When you tug a pole towards you, it yields in a different direction, thanks to its spinning disk.\u00a0 That's precession for you, I agree.\u00a0 But the initial spinning did not result from the tugging, right?\n\nIn always shying away from \"cult leader\" status, Fuller is free to exercise and share his private language, fact-laced and interdisciplinary.\u00a0 His relative success as an inventor, his track record, becomes his evidence that his thinking outside the box (which takes courage) is what more of us might want to try.\u00a0 \"Come on in, the water's fine\" is what echoes between the lines.",
