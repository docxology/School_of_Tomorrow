Clayton's on Princeton Square.\u00a0 Or was that a summer job.\u00a0 I also worked as a janitor at Forrestal Campus, cleaning up around the Tokamak makers (a fusion reactor prototype; I never saw it assembled just watched workers make parts for it).\u00a0 Forrestal is close to the main Princeton campus, by car at least, along Route One.\u00a0 I should Google Earth it.",
