They've been [registering their distaste](http://mail.geneseo.edu/pipermail/math-thinking-l/2010-February/date.html) for what some have called the \"object oriented paradigm\" (OOP), saying it's not really a \"paradigm\".That might be true.  Or if it is a paradigm, it's a very old one, embedded in natural language. Animals have behaviors signified by verbs.  Animals, signified by nouns, inherit characteristics (adjectives, properties) from their ancestors.  What's new about that?  Nothing.What's proved a lasting innovation was the notation, and that notation is \"dot notation\" (DN).  So instead of writing \"object oriented notation\" in place of \"object oriented paradigm\", I merely substitute \"dot notation\", with the caveat that some OO languages don't actually use it (which is fine, [diversity rocks](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/06/aristotle-was-right.html)).",
