  "content": "Earth has been attacked and was almost defeated before humans repulsed the alien invasion.\u00a0 Now the Earthians are taking the battle to the alien home world.\u00a0 Their psychology has discovered that when it comes to war fighting using weapons not requiring brawn to operate, that children make the best warriors as their nervous systems are more flexible and adaptive.\u00a0 So an all child army is being raised to fight the aliens.\n\nTrue to form, the adults are endlessly manipulative and the protagonist, as he is groomed for leadership, becomes increasingly aware that the true enemy may be these adults.\u00a0 His hunch is confirmed when the adults trick him into annihilating the alien home world.\n\nThe sense of compassion which enables Wiggins to outwit his enemy is also what leads him to love and understand them.\u00a0 In the case of the aliens, he feels obligated to make amends and find a way to continue their lineage.\u00a0 The Earthians make him an admiral at this point, a way of saying he's on his own.",
