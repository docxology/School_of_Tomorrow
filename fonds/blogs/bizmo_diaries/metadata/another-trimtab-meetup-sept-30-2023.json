That\u2019s what I got from the reading.\n...\n09:57:58 From Kirby Urner To Everyone:\n\tThis word \u201cteleological\u201d and how Bucky uses it: Synergetics Dictionary\n    worth a consult. Connects to his Bow-Tie symbol.\n\nThat was TrimTab Book Club. We read books by and about Bucky. Mark Wigley's book.\n\n10:24:26 From Kirby Urner To Everyone:\n\tMark Wigley: Buckminster Fuller Inc. Architecture in the Age of Radio\n10:24:42 From Stephen Bau To Everyone:\n\tReacted to \"Mark Wigley: Buckmin...\" with \u2764\ufe0f\nI think [Lionel](https://flic.kr/p/5B52pT) (today mostly muted and on another phone, conducting business) has been asking an interesting empirical question recently: if we make a Bucky Chatbot, will responses to promptings result in something less enigmatic than his seemingly-exclusionary home-brewed style of quasi-impenetrable prose?\u00a0Some might say the whole point is his language i.e. a prompting for \"a snippet of a play by Shakespeare but in the style of business English\" might be a recipe for making garbage. \"Why not just run the experiment and wait for results?\" is my attitude. And that seems to be what people (then on the call) are up to doing.Sam has been keen to run similar experiments based on writings by his grandad, F. Scott Fitzgerald. Perhaps test-developing this chatbot, around a challenging American Lit corpus will iron out some kinks in the workflow, paving the way for more author-reflective chatbots down the road, drawn from American Lit and elsewhere.We know people have mixed feelings about AI, given all that's sometimes weirdly hallucinatory and downright uncanny about its performances.\u00a0 What's the genre? Spoof? Horror? Museum Diorama? 'Certainly there's something oxymoronic about the notion of a \"robot sage\" if ya'll know what I'm sayin'. AI as a discipline inherits the carnival-style tone of illusion-making deceptions (ala the \"magic show\"). I think of Zoltar. I think of [The Turk](https://github.com/4dsolutions/elite_school/blob/master/ADS_intro_1.ipynb).When I say \"chatbot\" I'm referring to an active (attentive) inference engine, meaning one of these generative algorithms that returns polished, structured, grammatically correct text, in the ballpark of some prompt or sequence of prompts, some predictable response thereto, based on maybe billions of use cases.\u00a0GPTs these were (and are) called: Generative Pretrained Transformers.\u00a0 Pretraining does not preclude further training on the job. Start with an already vectorized large language model (LLM), but then shape it more.I volunteered during check-in that I was currently in touch with David Koski over the topic of great circles, surface and central angles project. I posted [a link](https://github.com/4dsolutions/m4w/blob/main/great_circles.ipynb).\u00a0 David (not on the call today) joined us (for the first time) on the most recent Zoom session, two weeks back, when [Victor Acevedo](https://www.laweekly.com/meet-metaphysical-digital-artist-victor-acevedo/) was our guest, talking about his own influences; Bucky for sure, but also the surrealists, while taking advantage of computerization.",
