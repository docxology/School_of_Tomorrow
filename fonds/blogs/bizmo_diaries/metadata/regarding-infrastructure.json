  "content": "Dawn is preparing financial statements for NPYM (Steering Committee meets today), Tara is researching robots per usual (we home-screened [I, Robot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343818/) last night, using the Toshiba and Optoma EP 729 projector (plot: a beautiful machine mind turns fascist seeing how badly humans behave and has to be taken out)).Per my recent Algebra with Python [moodle](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/noodling-in-moodle.html), I'm on the lookout for warm fuzzy, trick- performing pet robots with Python bindings (how about a Python that speaks Python? -- perhaps too limiting (\"roll over?\")).I'm wanting to propagate this algebra courseware beyond Winterhaven (my current base).  Dethe of [Living Code](http://livingcode.blogspot.com/) has stepped forward as a possible sysop for a new host.An expanding courseware network is a part of [my American dream](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=4257350&tstart=0) for a more accessible and relevant public school system.Update:  Tara and I had lunch with Dave Fabik at [American Dream Pizza](http://www.americandreampizza.net/), near Providence, then showed up at the Meeting House to show our videos, including that one about two ladies in the parking lot who get into a door slamming contest.  Quakers ate it up.Unrelated news: [Les Schwab](http://www.lesschwab.com/) diagnosed and fixed a puncture in my right front tire yesterday, caused by a small nail or something, all at no charge per their tire guarantee, which tires will of course need to be replaced at some point.",
