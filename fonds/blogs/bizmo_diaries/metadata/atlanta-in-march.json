We talked for about 20 minutes.This sounds like a stellar event (Conway, Penrose ... Knuth), but so far I haven't cobbled together a travel/hotel budget for any event like that.  My work in education is largely uncompensated. I get minimal perks.However, given I'm to be with family in Nashville the following weekend, I might be able to swing something.  If not, I'm aiming for G4G9, by which time I may well have a bigger budget (some wheels turn very slowly within the Fuller School -- in part because they're very big (lots of inertia)).",
