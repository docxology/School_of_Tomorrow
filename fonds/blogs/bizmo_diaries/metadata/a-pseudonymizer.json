But if someone left a laptop on the train, with all this valuable outcomes research info, it'd be untraceable to real individuals.I've looked through some literature and see modest use of this term \"pseudonymizer\" for roughly similar purposes, although not with reference to [HIPAA](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/usa-os.html) in particular.",
