  "content": "One of the great joys in getting married is the merging of families that occurs.\u00a0 In Dawn's case, I lucked out big time, with her brother Sam and partner Judy, musically minded creators of a new scene in Sisters, Camp Sherman more specifically, in the Metolius watershed.\u00a0 I also met Elise and then Les, that wonderful family.\u00a0\n\nDawn's extended family went to Indiana, Pennsylvania (a town).\u00a0 We spread her ashes there in 2009, following a Chicago Pycon.\u00a0 Tara and Alexia were with me then too.\n\nCompared to our city rat lifestyle, as non-profit hub managers (CUE and so on), Sam & Judy were the rustic true pioneers, living off the grid as year round caretakers of the lovely Dahl Ranch, in a time when the surrounding forest was lush.\u00a0 They hewed their own firewood, kept the swimming pool operational.\n\nLater, Sam, a skilled indoor finish carpenter, built a house for the two of them.\u00a0 Judy's mother joined them later.\u00a0 She died in the same Partners in Care facility Sam did, same room.\u00a0 That was on Gold Coach road, in a gorgeous patch of country.\n\nJust an hour ago I headed over to Smith Rock for some memories.\u00a0 The two sisters (Tara and Alexia) are exploring somewhere in the area.\n\nRadio is important here, and music.\u00a0 I'm listening to Psychedelic Protest on KPOV FM, a show sometimes hosted by the Smith's friend Steven.\u00a0 Mad Dog is hosting today.",
