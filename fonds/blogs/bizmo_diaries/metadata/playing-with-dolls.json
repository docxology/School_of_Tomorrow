Sims music videos, duh.\n\nThese [aren't too serious](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/03/hb2u-barbie.html), in terms of content, but in terms of skills, we're looking at [creative TV-making](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/03/human-subjects.html) with whatever the environment has to offer.\n\nYou'll find a lot in this genre, and that's a good sign. A next generation will know how to make television (knows already, at a tender young age).\n\n[For a younger crowd](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/quaker-preschool.html), or adults in the mood for more weirdness, there's always I Need a Nap, with [Weird Al](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0946148/) and [Kate Winslet](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000701/) [ sorry, video selfishly removed ]:",
