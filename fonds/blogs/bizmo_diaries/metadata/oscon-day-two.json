  "content": "Steve and I left the car on Senate Street and Maxed it, arriving before the doors opened.\u00a0 O'Reilly knows attendance at an early morning plenary will be down the 2nd day, so the walls were rolled in, curtailing the space, yet still it was huge, bigger than many churches, if not cathedrals.\u00a0 Yet here we were, the bazaar economy.\n\nMark Shuttleworth did the best keynote in the sense of most technical, introducing Juju and the direction Canonical has taken with their new desktop.\u00a0 I went up to him during Office Hours (an Expo Hall service) and thanked him for the boost he gave to curriculum writing / programming, including mine.\u00a0 The opportunity to hang out [with Alan Kay](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/at-summit.html), Guido etc., in person, for [three days in Kensington](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/home-to-pdx.html), was fantastic.\u00a0 That was some years ago.\u00a0 He again mentioned his early fascination with Smalltalk based Squeak as a trailblazer environment.\n\nThe Cloud business is an evolved reiteration of the ISP business, with customers wanting more control over what's on their servers.\u00a0 Juju is about porting ecosystems of connected applications between systems and designing their API interconnections using \"charms\".\n\nMy Quakers have converged at annual session by this time.\u00a0 Although [I'm an AFSC rep](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/thinking-about-afsc.html), I'm leaving it to Eddy Crouch to run the interest group and help manage the NPYM / AFSC interface.\u00a0 Getting more Quaker services into the Cloud, education-related, sounds like an interesting project.\u00a0 That might just mean a bookstore, branching out into access to archives.\u00a0 History, timelines, biographies, scanned minutes, records, journals... a kind of archive.org for Quakers?\u00a0 New branches could start an instance this way, by customizing templates.\u00a0 New classes of Friend... (in the sense of types or species)... we shall see.\n\nI'm in HP's sponsored talk on its Cloud services at the moment.\u00a0 They've moved into the data center business more, following Amazon and others.\n\nThe Facebook keynote was also good.\u00a0 The fact that so much hardware is still closed design has led to the same basic wheels being re-invented over and over with lots of incompatible variations.\u00a0 Secrecy begets duplication and meaningless resource-wasting inconsistencies, such as train tracks with different gauges.\n\nOpenStack on the software side has its parallel initiatives on the hardware side.\u00a0 Facebook is supporting that. \u00a0Standardizations begets savings. \u00a0It's the old pendulum, between a tightly knit civilization and a more every-man-for-himself Wild West kind of place. \u00a0Oscillations occur.",
