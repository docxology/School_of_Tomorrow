  "content": "Finished an intro to OO concepts at Winterhaven today, using the About Classes PDF (see [list](http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/pygeom.html)).  I also screened the opening 15-20 mins of [Revolution OS](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308808/).  Premise for showing that: it's important to know what \"open source\" is if we're one of its capitals (you can buy a copy at [Powell's Technical](http://wifipdx.com/spots/Powells_Technical_Bookstore)).Next I'm meeting with Tom and friends.  [Tom spearheaded TRP](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/07/deq.html) (Transportation Reaching People), a nonprofit arm of county government, compensating for mileage with Tri-Met funds, the metro net having a mandate to get citizens to/from important appointments and so on.  This system gives seniors a more independent lifestyle in some cases.  Portland, Maine has been doing something similar (I saw it on the news).I also confessed some of my career aspirations in [this post](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2006-January/005704.html) to edu-sig.",
