  "content": "Some long time readers of this blog know that I spend a lot of my time connecting to [a small server farm in Illinois](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/06/back-office.html), where I plow with my \"[OST tractor](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/at-wherecamppdx.html)\", planting seeds, sewing, tending, reaping. \u00a0A job.\n\nThis used to be NetMath, connected to the University of Illinois, than acquired and moved to Sebastopol. Our leading lights are the Grays. \u00a0The staff is spread out. \u00a0Sometimes we send \"OST moles\" to conferences, recruiting students and faculty.\n\nWe hang out on Skype and have a faculty lounge on Facebook for round the water cooler conversations. \n\n[When we get together](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/02/make-mathematics.html), we do Show & Tell. \n\nBruce shared limericks and sang the blues for the Grays' dog, Wilson, who recently died. \u00a0KB1 shared about her food van / bizmo, for sale on eBay. \u00a0KB2 shared about her boat slip, currently sublet while she works on the boat angle. \u00a0Steve showed slides from Brazil. \u00a0I shared my opening slides [from Occupy Portland](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/occupy-portland-event.html), celebrating FNB's central role. \u00a0Lorri mocked the genre with her \"favorite candle\" presentation.\n\nMostly we do a lot of planning, comparing notes, future visioning. \u00a0That's what lots of companies do, including other schools. \u00a0Ours uses quite a bit of technology, in order to provide students with a learning experience. \u00a0The old idea of a \"correspondence school\" comes to mind, with the Internet making everything run faster.\n\nTrish remarked on my Nirel-brand cuffka, a standard part of my costume these days. \u00a0She's a performer and shared a clip of one of her roles in Guys & Dolls.\n\nSome of our crew are avid players of [Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan). \u00a0I studied the rules for this language game, but am doubtful I would prove victorious against such serious players. \u00a0Debra won her round though, and she had not played before.",
