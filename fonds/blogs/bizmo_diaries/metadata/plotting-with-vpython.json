Sure, other packages have more bells and whistles, plus 3D plotting of various kinds, but then VPython has all these other advantages, including a rather [streamlined API](http://vpython.org/webdoc/visual/index.html).I'm looking forward to the new release.  Currently, installing VPython on Linux and/or Mac is not trivial.  Better installers would go a long ways towards making this a more usable add-on for Python.Free cone day at Ben & Jerry's, just got a text message.  Gotta run.",
