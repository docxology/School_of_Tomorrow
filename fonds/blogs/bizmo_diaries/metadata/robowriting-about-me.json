His journey from the 1960s in Portland, Oregon, to becoming a pivotal figure in the realm of mathematical pedagogy, showcases a lifelong dedication to the discipline[1]. Urner's work, particularly in the development of \"tetrahedral\" thinking, not only challenges conventional mathematical perspectives but also enriches our understanding of geometric relationships, thereby expanding the boundaries of mathematical inquiry[2].\n\nUrner's contributions extend beyond theoretical musings; they are deeply rooted in practical applications and pedagogical innovations. His engagement with the \"Learning to Code\" movement and the integration of coding with mathematical learning represent a forward-thinking approach to education that prepares students for the complexities of the modern world[4]. This blend of mathematics and programming underlines Urner's role in shaping a new generation of thinkers capable of navigating the digital landscape with mathematical acuity. Furthermore, his leadership in the Math 4 Wisdom community and his efforts to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and their real-world applications underscore his commitment to fostering a deeper appreciation for mathematics[5][13].\n\nMoreover, Urner's prolific output, including curriculum development, public lectures, and online contributions, reflects a mathematician's zeal for sharing knowledge and inspiring curiosity[6][8][14]. His work transcends traditional academic boundaries, reaching a global audience through digital platforms and collaborative projects. This democratization of mathematical learning, coupled with his holistic approach to teaching, positions Urner as a mathematician in the truest sense\u2014dedicated not only to the advancement of mathematical knowledge but also to its dissemination and application in enriching human understanding and capability.\n\nIn conclusion, Kirby Urner's extensive, rigorous, and innovative contributions to mathematics education, research, and service firmly establish him as a mathematician. His work exemplifies the spirit of mathematical inquiry, pushing the boundaries of traditional education and fostering a global community of learners and thinkers. Through his dedication to teaching, curriculum development, and community engagement, Urner has indelibly shaped the landscape of mathematics education, making him a mathematician not just in title, but in action and impact.\n\nCitations:\n\n[1] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/from-new-math-gnu-kirby-urner\n\n[2] https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Research/KirbyUrner\n\n[3] https://www.linkedin.com/posts/4dsolutions_book-report-adventures-in-math-teaching-activity-7114975013312634880-Ih5-\n\n[4] https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/where-coding-meets-math-kirby-urner\n\n[5] https://twitter.com/thekirbster?lang=en\n\n[6] https://youtube.com/watch?v=Lzv30IKvfZs\n\n[7] https://wikieducator.org/User:KirbyUrner/Autobio\n\n[8] https://youtube.com/watch?v=g14mu4uWD4E\n\n[9] http://www.4dsolutions.net/ocn/\n\n[10] https://groups.google.com/g/mathfuture/c/GnK7MWT6ddg/m/6weAlQJjAwAJ\n\n[11] https://www.academia.edu/70156799/4D_Solutions_4dsolutions_net_\n\n[12] https://princeton.academia.edu/kirbyurner\n\n[13] https://www.math4wisdom.com/wiki/Exposition/Welcome\n\n[14] https://github.com/4dsolutions\n\n[15] https://groups.google.com/g/mathfuture/c/hk9hYITu-Js/m/geFyP-sgCQAJ\n\n[16] https://www.grunch.net/4dsolutions/kirby.html",
