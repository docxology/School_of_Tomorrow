The guy was on his cell with [Evergreen Aviation Museum](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/10/hotel-oregon.html) (home of the Spruce Goose), clearing the way to field test some telescopes, with an eye toward some Star Party down the road.  Those Periodic Table shower curtains looked cool.After meeting his friend at the eatery, he ushered me over to Pauling House where he had these new Wanderers mugs, only $15 apiece.  I was happy to get one.Note this wasn't a scheduled meeting, just a random encounter between Wanderers.",
