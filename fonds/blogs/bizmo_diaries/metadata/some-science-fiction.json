  "content": "The Dog Planet\n\nPer science fiction, or mythology as we used to call it, somewhere near Sirius, on the Dog Planet, the dogs live as long as we do.\u00a0\n\nBut because of relativity, and black holes, the dogs we get as projections, echoes, on Planet Earth, don't live nearly as long as we do.\u00a0\n\nAnd yet when they get older, faster than we, they may also get wiser, so we have much to learn from them, thanks to relativity, and science fiction.\n\nOne maybe doesn't teach an old dogs new tricks, but they learn them, from whom it's hard to say.",
