  "content": "Synergetics heads will appreciate this snowboarder mag logo for its use of Frequency in conjunction with Similarity.  In the [Synergetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergetics_(Fuller)) vocabulary, Frequency relates to size whereas Angle relates to shape.  These may be varied independently.  \n\nWarning: \u00a0per Wikipedia, Synergetics is an \"iconoclastic\" discipline, roughly meaning: \u00a0unorthodox, verboten, off limits, fringe, in the twilight zone, remote, maverick, experimental, weird, odd-ball, off-beat etc. \u00a0But then probably more people read Bucky than Heidegger so it's all relative anyway.",
