That's in pseudo-sql against a database I've never met in person. A mind game.\n\nOriginally I'd titled this post \"Summer BBQ\" because I had this metaphor in mind:\u00a0 I've stoked the briquettes with all the newspaper needed, and lit the pyre (if I might call it that); lets see if the briquettes catch, which means they'll generate their own heat, long after all the newspaper is consumed.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/52283684666/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nThat metaphor in turn was about my approach to andragogy.\u00a0 If I keep fawning over the flames, fanning them, I won't know if they would go out without me.\u00a0 Given I could use such feedback, I'll aim to stand back.\u00a0 I've worked on the ignition phase plenty, it seems to me.\n\nI'm still being rather abstract, but that's OK.\u00a0 Lets get back to burgers.\u00a0 Portland has a whole week celebrating the genre and recommends retailers offer an $8 burger week special, their choice of what to try.\u00a0 At least that's my understanding of the challenge.\u00a0 I don't know what syndicate is behind it exactly, only that this is not a new institution.\n\nAlmost in anticipation of said burger week, Glenn and I sampled the offerings at the Yes Please Smashburger shack, a certified food cart right across from the Linus Pauling House.\u00a0 I took quite a few pictures and have left them interspersed.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/52282704052/in/dateposted-public/)",
