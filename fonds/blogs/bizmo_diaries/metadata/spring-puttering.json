  "content": "I've contracted with my fellow Americans to do some yard work for me, as I'm lacking many middle class accouterments, such as an edger or blower, not even a weed whacker I'm pretty sure.Way cool to have a pickup haul stuff away, although we contract for curbside lawn debris pickup as well, along with regular garbage and recycling.This particular contract terminates end of June, as I let stuff go dry in the summer, not wanting to pay for cosmetics, although I do keep those washers going (both dishes and clothes), believe in hygienics, pay attention to pull dates and like that.While I believe in doing my part for property values in these parts, I'm so glad we're not in some [Over the Hedge](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/05/over-hedge-movie-review.html) scenario, with knocks on the door because [the shrubs](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/happy-day.html) aren't regulation, or whatever the hell.",
