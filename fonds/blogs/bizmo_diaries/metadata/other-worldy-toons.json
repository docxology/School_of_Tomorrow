  "content": "If you watch this short toon by Andreas Hykade et al, I recommend clicking through to Youtube and getting it high def on a big screen, as I did, if at all possible.\n\nIf you recall Disney's Fantasia, this is every bit as visually and musically interesting as one of those, but a tad more demented, in a way that recalls a cartooning style that Disney defines itself against, as cuter, less demented.\n\nYou can see links to Cubism, Picasso, and of course Dali and surrealism, in this genre, as well as in this very toon.\u00a0 So iconograpic.\u00a0 So language.\u00a0 So Wittgenstein therefore (these are \"words with use\" too, these signifying \"heads\", so familiar).\n\nIn calling it [the Videogrammatron](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/videogrammatron.html) a long time ago, when still with McGraw-Hill, my proto Youtube-like database for STEM.math-teaching via TV's CTW, I was dreaming of clips like this one, off the wall yet compelling, engaging.\n\nThey're other-worldy in a way, as in \"Other World\": not merely imaginative an the \"idle fantasy\" sense.\u00a0 Like [The Lego Movie](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/02/the-lego-movie-movie-review.html), they partake of the daimonic as Patrick Harpur uses the term.\n\nThese blogs go in layers and if you dig back you'll find the Portland Knowledge Lab ([PKL](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-beginning.html)) working to keep Portland weird by underlining its underground comic identity [as ToonTown](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/shovel-ready.html), could be one of many.\u00a0 We love our manga and anime.\n\nI realize now the Cabalistic Tetragrammaton was influential at least in providing the word (Videogrammatron -- with tron more from Tron and elecTronics); but also in the sense of \"combinations and permutations\" ala Sesame Street, with each episode a mix of old and new material, lots of repetition.\n\nThis is also a Hypertoon a sorts, an idea also defined in these web pages.",
