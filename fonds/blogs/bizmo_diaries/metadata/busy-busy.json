  "content": "I just got off the phone with someone at Yale (she called me), having placed [my OS Bridge proposal](http://opensourcebridge.org/proposals/34) in the hopper.  We're looking to attract an out of town audience.Dr. Nick scoured Powell's Books on Hawthorne last night and came up with [Walking With Nobby](http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Nobby-Conversations-Norman-Brown/dp/156279132X) as an ultra-cool find (I promptly bought it, so he could peruse as my guest, leave it for me).  Nobby is the late Norman O. Brown, author of a kind of aphoristic glue language important in my formative years, helped tilt me towards Princeton philosophy, [Dr. Kaufmann](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/philosophy-101.html) etc.  Later, [E.J. Applewhite](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/applewhites.html) showed me where he'd added Love's Body to his Georgetown apartment collection.  NOB has links to Wittgenstein too.Razz, my \"welcome wagon\" (for chauffering guests around Portland), is overdue for some maintenance.  I'll take her out to Dick Hannah if my [earmarks](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/04/earmarks.html) get through.  You'd think we'd be [further along](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/01/freezing-rain.html) by now, but big wheels turn slowly.I was late to Oversight tonight, glad Maye thought to call me.  I'm somewhat distracted.  Dr. Nick is on his way, drove him to Union Station this afternoon.  I'll start reading that book now.",
