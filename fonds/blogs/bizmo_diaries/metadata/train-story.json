The sleek design says \"built for speed\".[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4W-X8fd-Z_nb-2GPpN_pSIjA7ZUVgnggi5tEaytoLbodPHho2HQ0aypiwh0ptDarVJflyjvFgGuzaLZI8k3MY8wbBumsJMpnRFX0_uCh6slXPbiTsYzCgCPzgqlEM1Z4zxPsp/s1600-h/typewriter.jpg)However, high speed rail is the stuff of [science fiction](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/pin-ball-in-pdx.html) in these parts, as are bedroom communities served by commuter rail.  Amtrak operates a bus fleet on I-5.  A lot of the track is older than this typewriter (photo taken with permission at Powell's Technical).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEglHWsuBZnBSbQj8LTwM7MOQOFFcuWnatr3c2YSadZZ2q_-3auZAZPsM-bLJ15vEUygoyDyf6fq9EVwNguS0EX4QDaFICUi0giPgiSYYtzDbJJ7IHvUOymthTy6tGZWPXfgzTHy/s1600-h/union_station.jpg)Portland's new Pearl District is still up and coming.  We ate at Whole Foods today, after shopping for books, dropping Nick at Union Station (background).  Nick was taking an Amtrak bus to Eugene.  That's Razz (my car) in the foreground.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKAP3tvx0hrKQKqYU32tm3Nr3KwF3HSMo_vSTe_Hz-OF_pS0OPthIt88IfHjJw76a-aiP-xAnAR1EJZRHoJ0RKJkUEVewYAjTw2DuxBeF-2FaTuBJKon54vbKTb9W-E57q99IE/s1600-h/pearl.jpg)Here's looking [180 degrees](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/06/immersion-experience.html) at some of the new construction.  That's the Fremont Bridge in the background, with the train tracks off to the right (behind the fence).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjYVUMCy0Va0_7ghS7zBqEK6sLpMbhNuQKUnOkNcVGJ8fgkpaMSTRwsq2wP3g8bITk3cFyx3S_PoEoYcj8Xi5J-8ot4TnJADiWKJTReS6w5PlZN0bBIHodZbv37kY3b5lyvHFv2/s1600-h/train_rear.jpg)Here's the tail end of the handsome Amtrak train, leaving Union Station and heading north along the west side of the Willamette River, moving slowly.  Our passenger trains usually run [behind schedule](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/07/ghost-trains.html), sometimes by many hours.All photographs taken today with my trusty Olympus Stylus 720 SW.",
