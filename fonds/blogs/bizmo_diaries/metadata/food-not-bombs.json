  "content": "I'd set aside tonight for Food Not Bombs, which was important to me during the recession, both in terms of keeping myself fed and for networking.\n\nI guessed I'd stick to that plan, even though Melody isn't going.\u00a0 It's not like I'm out of food.\u00a0 I've got my Soylent.\u00a0 I guessed wrong though.\u00a0 By the time I found my bike light I'd decided to stay home.\n\nCooking + Mathematics + Coding == great curriculum.  Lots of concurrency sensibility comes from sharing a kitchen.

One way: fork math into two tracks, delta and lambda for short.

McGraw-Hill is clueless!
