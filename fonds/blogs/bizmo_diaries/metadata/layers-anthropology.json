  "content": "Those who stare at GIS displays a lot (not me these days) know that data comes in layers. \u00a0Check out Google Earth or one of those: you can turn the layers on and off. \u00a0Turn the roads on and off. Check out the I-net. Highlight different features.\n\nI think that meditation was in part kicked off by [Applewhite's saying](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-age-of-carbon.html) \"tomographic\" with respect to [Synergetics](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/06/gobbledygook.html) (in The Futurist), a word found in PET, positron emission tomography. Positrons don't last very long but they're integral primitive objects with their key roles. \u00a0Solar fusion [is positronic](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/astro/solarpp.html#c1) along one path. \u00a0CERN is really into positron channeling, not just hadrons.\n\nESRI's ArcView and related products, give you layers from datasets. \u00a0Superimpose this and that, learn from the patterns. \u00a0Like when slime molds define a transportation system, do the math.\n\nSome tribes speak of the ancestors stacked up on one's shoulders, like a totem pole I suppose. \u00a0Some journal-keepers might have branded that \"superstitious\" denying them their metaphors for what we in the computer programming business take for granted: \u00a0the objects have their lineage, their parents.\n\nWhen a community is stressed, you will see the alchemy at work, as personalities differentiate and assume a foreground. \u00a0[Winston Churchill](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/great-pirates.html) was the war time leader for Britain, a product of those times. Or does it go the other way? \u00a0Historians debate these chicken and egg matters. \u00a0How does one explain Hitler or Napoleon?\n\nLet me point to the TV remote as one of the great equalizers we didn't have back then. \u00a0We're freer to register \"ratings\", a level of approval / disapproval. \u00a0Some people say Hitler would have been that many more times a monster if Nazis had today's TV. \u00a0But would his series have taken off? \u00a0Things have to check out to some degree, and with television comes a new level of scrutiny -- or not if the newsies get lazy.\n\n[Omni-triangulating](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/omnitriangulating.html) and integrity go together. \u00a0We have a lot of well-placed faith in not coming across utter contradictions. \u00a0How well placed is that faith? \u00a0I'd turn that around and ask what else there is to have faith in? \u00a0Utter capriciousness? \u00a0How does one \"surrender\" to that? \u00a0We'd rather surrender to \"eternal laws\" I'd usually think, though we do respect freedom and heroic postures.\n\nAnyway, back to layers, we see them in people. \u00a0Shades come to the foreground, as a new persona takes over, slowly solidifies. \u00a0We all create / cast each other. \u00a0Projection is that powerful. \u00a0It takes a village to have a self, or at least a self of the kind we think social, in shape to interact. \u00a0We get new levels with greater aggregates or \"[piles](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/11/physics-emergent-isepp-lecture.html)\".\n\nThe hermit gets tired of social interaction and retreats to a life away from the rat race. \u00a0We sometimes call that retirement in this country. \u00a0In India, they see \"holiness\" in that, but then \"holiness\" is a chief form of entertainment in the land of Ganesh.",
