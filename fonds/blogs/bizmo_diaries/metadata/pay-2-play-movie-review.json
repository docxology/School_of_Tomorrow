  "content": "Now this is one clever film.\u00a0 I had no idea that Parker Brothers stole Monopoly from the public domain, ultimately from a woman who followed [the economist Henry George](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/12/wanderers-2009128.html) and was communicating the opposite message.\u00a0 That's hilarious.\n\nA guy named Darrow learned it from a bunch of Quakers and then colluded with Parker Brothers on getting a patent.\n\nThis all came out when the inventor of Anti-Monopoly was defending his right to publish his game.\n\nNow that's a story worth spreading far and wide.\n\nThe documentary is mostly about the broken US political system, further wrecked by the Supreme Court with its [Citizens United](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/11/occupy-unmasked-movie-review.html) ruling.\n\nThe links to a Banksy-like painter of \"Monopoly guy\" takes us to Occupy, where this symbol often appeared.\u00a0 Mission:\u00a0 Occupy.\u00a0 From Occupy, we move to May Day.\n\nI like using Monopoly Guy for Wanderers, mixing him with a lamp post on a chess board.\u00a0 He's been drinking a lot and walks randomly as a result, the connotation being [mathematical](http://giantbattlingrobots.blogspot.com/2009/01/random-walk-down-monopoly-lane.html): osmosis, cellular automata and like that.\n\nWell crafted, mixed with street art / PR.\u00a0 Another good entry on the [Corporate Personhood shelf](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/this-land-is-your-land-movie-review_28.html).",
