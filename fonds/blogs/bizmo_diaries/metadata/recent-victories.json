  "content": "I urge this as an exercise, to review recent victories, you might think \"to build self esteem?\" but not so much, more it's about seeing yourself honestly for what you consider \"a victory\".\u00a0 Was there someone to defeat?\u00a0 Or was it some personal goal attained i.e. were you defeating your own lethargy?\n\nOne of mine was getting the Raspberry Pi to talk to my HDMI monitor in the office.\u00a0 The solution was quite trivial and amounted to tweaking some settings in a text file, config.txt, already well commented.\u00a0 But there's a sense of pride in doing, called positive reinforcement, that is it's own reward.\u00a0 I remember when I bought an inexpensive capacitor and Bill Sheppard (a Wanderer) welded it on for me, replacing another on my DVD player's circuit board.\u00a0 An investment was saved from the trash.\u00a0 Skills had been well used.\n\nHere's another.\u00a0 My housemate is a lifestyle sculptress, herself the prime subject, meaning strict rules and attention to consumption and waste patterns.\u00a0 All the glass bottles piling up from my six-packs were not helping her keep six-pack abs (a result of eating vegan + plenty of exercise), plus that's a lot of recycling.\u00a0 Solution:\u00a0 buying growlers instead, where the same bottle is reused, and filled from a keg. A higher grade, fresher beer is procured at a bulk price, and given constraints on transportation, it's gotten less often and in a healthier way.\u00a0 I can bike a few miles for my 64 oz. container of Hub IPA.\n\nNext:\u00a0 I'm getting [more into Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).\u00a0 John T. [at work](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-fragments.html) had gone through a number of math languages, looking for innocence and purity, something aesthetic.\u00a0 He felt his quest had come to a worthy terminus in Haskell.\u00a0 A lot of thinking had already gone into Lambda Calculus when these functional languages were spawned, so they inherit that layer.\u00a0 It's like an oil or natural gas field.\u00a0 Once you start fracking in Haskellville, you get a quick infusion of gas, where gas is a good thing.\n\nDoes chronicling victories mean one should not also chronicle defeats?\u00a0 \"Defeat\" is the grammatical opposite of \"victory\", not \"failure\", not \"loss\" (although \"loss\" is closer, since to lose is to be non-victorious).\u00a0 I'd say your objective, in this mindfulness training, is to strive to report evenly.\u00a0 Focusing on losses may be a way of avoiding responsibility whereas capitalizing on victories, even small ones, is building up your hand and thereby staying in the game, whatever game.\u00a0 \"I'm still a player\" is the battle cry of the undefeated (those still willing to experience victories).\n\nA next step with this practice is to tease victory stories out of others, get them to focus on wins in your presence, and then celebrate those victories with them.\u00a0 This has a lot to do with friendship and being affirming.\n\nAt SMAD the other day we talked about \"shame\" and the bias of our group and group leader was definitely against it, i.e. shame was cast is an unhealthy substitute for other states that would improve the world more effectively.\n\nOne tends to self-divide into a self-teacher within, and one's admonishments to oneself are like that of a coach to a team, but in what sport and what kind of team?\u00a0 We differ a lot in that dimension and when we attempt to teach others in ways we teach ourselves (often quite effectively I might add) we may encounter types of resistance that are to us unfamiliar because lo, personalities differ (duh).\n\nSome people inwardly curse themselves out when they drop the ball in some way, but their flip side self, who takes the heat, is not overly discomfited because there's a bond of trust with this particular coach.\u00a0 \"She berates me in just the way I need\" says the grateful trainee.\u00a0 Note the rise of \"nagware as a service\" i.e. people use cyber-tools to goad them to run more, swim more or achieve whatever goals (sometimes with gifts to \"anti-charities\" used as penalties).\u00a0 Other people need to be very diplomatic with themselves and only sound affirming, because any self-cursing triggers a spiral into self-hate that leads to poor team performance on no real sense of a pro coach.\u00a0 There's only despair and losing.\n\nWhen you meet a new person, one thing to discover is their \"coach me\" API.\u00a0 However some may runaway scared before you get that far.\u00a0 They hear you cursing yourself out, see the flame-thrower you use on yourself routinely and pretty much seem to laugh off, as you like having a dragon for a coach, consider it a privilege.\n\nHowever, your onlooker just worries that dragon will flame at him and he's just not ready to be on such a team.\u00a0 That's really understandable.\u00a0 Or replace \"dragon\" (handsome and romantic) with \"ogre\".\u00a0 \"I just couldn't live around that ogre\" is a common statement in divorce courts, if translated honestly.\u00a0 Yes, Shrek has done much to improve the ogre image / PR, but I'm still more of a dragon fan myself (which sounds easy to say I suppose).\n\nWhile on this topic:\u00a0 I remember the Scandinavian fascination with \"trolls\" as relatively cute and cuddly.\u00a0 Internet culture seems to have singled out \"troll\" and \"trolling\" as fair game for banishment and/or flames.\u00a0 The question is where does honest and open agitation and debate cross the line?\u00a0 Some groups just don't like to be challenged.\n\nFor example, if you speak up amidst Quakers, saying that holding nuclear weapons was like spitting on Jesus while he dragged his cross through Jerusalem, are you written off as \"a troll\"?\n\nThe abomination some Quakers trolled about, pre Civil War, was the holding of slaves, still considered perfectly legal and Biblical in those days (today it's more underground, a target of FBI and Homeland Security investigations). \u00a0To this day, many Christians say \"they hold slaves in the Bible so it must be fine and dandy with God, so shut up and leave us alone already!\". \u00a0And indeed God and the apostles say things about how how the relationship of master / slave should be conducted (respectfully), which implies an acceptance. \u00a0Many Biblical authorities have said Jesus never said anything against slavery, but I'd say the derivation of the word \"Friend\" (as in not-servant, not-slave -- a free and willing agent) traces to John 15:15 wherein Jesus says he's fed up with slave-minded\u00a0sycophants\u00a0who just wanna get to heaven, over his dead body if necessary (paraphrasing). He was lonely for real friends, who can blame him?\n\nQuakers were less into aping the Biblical cultures (various brand of Holy Lander), as if the point of that book were to stage theater (re-enactments) -- though sure, it's full of good stories, worthy of cinematic treatment (not to worry, more to come I'm sure).\n\nNukes likewise enslave, by holding a sword of Damocles over vast populations, but some \"Saved Christians\" defend this grave sin on Manifest Destiny grounds (\"if God didn't mean us to hold nukes, then we wouldn't have nukes already\" -- the same demented argument used to keep slaves (\"using the existence of a state or condition, as a justification for its continuance\" -- there must be some Latin name for that fallacy; \"status quo ad absurdum\"?)).\n\nScandinavians think trolls are adorable, and Scandinavians don't have nukes.\u00a0 I'm thinking [more pro-troll PR](http://scarlettstar.deviantart.com/art/troll-girl-191638367) may be in order, to balance what the oafish ghouls and ogres have been up to.\u00a0 We're not just pro-elvyn around here, we're pro-troll (traditionally they fight each other, so heyoka (and watch out!)).\n\nSometimes the same story may be told as a defeat or a victory.\u00a0 If the premise is \"loser\" then I couldn't even keep track of the 2011 tax statement and so I haven't done the FASFA yet, egad.\u00a0 However, having filed through H&R Block I was able to have my Razr / M talk me through an interesting set of turns and I didn't even have an accident while admiring the pretty GPS map. Victorious outcome:\u00a0 I now have a copy of said statement and a better relationship with my smartphone (we're spending more time together).\n\n[The Raspberry Pi](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/07/from-open-bastion.html) is a small computer.\u00a0 Steve Holden not only gave me a unit, in my capacity as PSF member, after watching him set up a few, but lent me the book.\u00a0 Sliding the SD card from the unit to the Mac Air allowed me to tweak config.txt on a different machine, and after awhile I just used on-board vi to tweak the settings and reboot.\u00a0 I have an aspect ratio I can live with.\u00a0 The unit is also connected by Ethernet to the office router and is happy to browse the Web.",
