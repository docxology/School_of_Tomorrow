  "content": "Cool executive class toyz, ready for front lines service in math teaching circles.  Backed by this 1960s classic, who could go wrong?  My thanks to [Glenn Stockton](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/12/cascadia-wild.html) for the gift of this book.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhmpBIb2AWTraM62BEsBdSlpm7YYw9qNc64XnYUI_AnvJpRUWaylqRo83EepVDnPpJOwCgqMRg56HwzsdCnSJrFs0hcWk99rQEdV46ZSfgoHj4eg53SuS3V-xSRDmGYOYqeLXt5/s1600-h/PC070001.JPG)No, I'm not selling these to you directly, just suggesting you [be on the lookout](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/toyz.html) for what could become important [tools in your trade](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/mathematical-toyz.html).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhURwGDmwTXmRWMwe0Mix5hWeoqbApRmzHi0sjwBz4xmzSWG7Kg2pEaTfkYo3sumaghJXSUq-uUniIsn05QiBtucrXAzXLg5mLMqvxK0Y1LKSGXCXIRib2WIhFWM6pKi4DRtKb5/s1600-h/PC070003.JPG)Remember, AAB = Mite of volume 1/8th, T-volume same as A,B (1/24), the latter being for 5-fold analysis ala the hexapents (also depicted).You don't have to start with these cellular components though.  Any standard Renaissance approach to the Truncated Icosahedron and Stella Octangula should do fine (check Da Vinci?).",
