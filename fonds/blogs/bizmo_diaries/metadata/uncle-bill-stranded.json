  "content": "I'm pretty sure Uncle Bill, age 97, is still stuck at Union Station.\u00a0 I got a surprise call from the guy at 4:15, right before I was to start teaching class.\u00a0 He was in Portland, here for the day, to see a different relative.\u00a0 The only thing was:\u00a0 he hadn't been able to reach said relative on the phone, yet he came anyway.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI couldn't help.\u00a0 My Python for High School was to start in 15 minutes.\n\nThe good news was that even if he was missing his 4 PM train, he'd get the next one back to Seattle around 6 PM.\u00a0 He'd make it to Union Station by taxi.\u00a0 Good plan.\u00a0 I encouraged him to high tail it down there.\n\nAs it turned out, however, the Steel Bridge was \"having issues\" (due to the heat we think) and Amtrak trains were stranded on both sides, going nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nOr was the one in Tacoma having other issues?\u00a0 Bill's ticket was (is) for the Coast Starlight, coming north.\u00a0 I'm watching for updates on Twitter.\n\nAs for me, I need to get up early (alarm set for 5 AM) and start a next teaching gig.\u00a0 I have a pretty full calendar this coming month.\n\nWe're in the middle of a heat wave in Portland.\u00a0 Fortunately, I'll have completed my first session before it really heats up.\u00a0 The course is mapped to the New York clock.\u00a0 The headquarters are in Turkey.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/52208250265/in/dateposted-public/)",
