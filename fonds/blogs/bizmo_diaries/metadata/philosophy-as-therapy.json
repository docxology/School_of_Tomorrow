This is actually in the adjoining medical offices building, adjacent the hospital proper.\u00a0 Both Carol and I had appointments there.\n\nLacking any informative dialog with ETs in this chapter, we resorted to inventing them, or extending anthropology towards science fiction.\u00a0 \"Imagine a tribe...\" is how Wittgenstein would start a scenario. \"... that multiples differently\" I'm adding.\u00a0 Then I go into a riff on tetravolumes.\n\nThe point was to demonstrate \"paradigm shift\" in a simple way.\u00a0 The duckrabbit type gestalt switches convey one aspect of meaning, central to Philosophical Investigations Part 2.\u00a0 But not all language games come with such convenient [Necker Cube type branding](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/necker-cube-guy.html).\u00a0 That's where an XYZ versus IVM set of coordinates comes in.\n\nWhy don't I just jump in to having ETs teach me this alien thinking?\u00a0 Because I grew up reading Asimov and Heinlein wherein the author doesn't have to develop a relationship with the characters other than by creating them.\u00a0 The Martians or ETs I create have a pedagogical (andragogical) purpose.\u00a0 If it turns out actual ETs also use a tetrahedron for unit volume, we'll say humans were anticipatory in this chapter.\n\nOr maybe we'll say ETs were actually among us.\u00a0 I'm aware of schools of thought that would suggest a military interest in the outward technology, but with much less of an interest in a Vulcan mind meld, if you know your lore.\u00a0 Some television has explored more the direction of meme exchange.\n\nMartian Math, as a genre of science fiction with math in it, suggests at least a Platonic relationship with these alt-humans, i.e. a shared fascination with Platonic forms.\n\nLets use the IVM-to-XYZ conversion (switch) to (a) demonstrate the idea of a \"paradigm shift\" in microcosm and to (b) explore what might be considered an \"alien\" mindset.",
