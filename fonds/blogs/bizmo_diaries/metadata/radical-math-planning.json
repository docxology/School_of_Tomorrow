[ The radical sign](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=7007260&tstart=0) designates the nth root of a number, by default its second.Our zip code area, 97214, is [cram packed with talent](http://www.portlandenergystrategies.com/).  The TV series would be fantastic, but off beat, more [underground comic](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/02/exchange-with-japan.html) than Hollywood blockbuster.
