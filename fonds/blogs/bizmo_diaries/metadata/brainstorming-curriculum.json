  "content": "Today I brainstormed [curriculum ideas](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1689861&tstart=0) with Anna Roys, who dreams of a new charter school near Anchorage, Alaska.  I'll be able to use much of the resulting six page document in my work with other schools as well.I put a lot of emphasis on the transition from ASCII to [Unicode](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/unicode.html), on the analogy of going from gray scale or \"black and white\" television to images with more color depth (pg. 5).  Sums of successive rows of [Pascal's triangle](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/09/focal-points.html) = successive doublings, i.e. 2**N, a tie-in to Unicode's permuting of bits for labeling/mapping purposes (pp. 2-3).Should a core nonprofit or for-profit provide oversight services to multiple schools, each with a local executive team, plus parent, teacher and student councils (pg. 1)?  We didn't reach an answer to this question in Anna's case (it's too early to know).",
