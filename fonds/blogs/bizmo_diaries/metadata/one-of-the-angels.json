He is survived by his partner Jeannie, two \nsister\u2019s Michele and Brenda, his mother Marilyn, father Jack and \nstepmother Edyta, and two nephews Ryan and Nick. CJ was born in NY. CJ \nwas a Comprehensivist and Explorer in Universe.\n\nIn my own experience, CJ was a great inspiration and collaborator, whether it was a deep exploration\n into Bucky Fuller, synergetic geometry,  philosophy, Dante, Dostoevsky,\n Saramago or Mary Shelley's FRANKENSTEIN, our last deep read. He had a \nreading plan that extended years into the future.  In recent months, as \nhe refined his ideas about the need for comprehensivity, he encouraged \nall to be macro-comprehensive and micro-incisive.\n\nCJ was one of the angles. \n\n-- D.W. Jacobs",
