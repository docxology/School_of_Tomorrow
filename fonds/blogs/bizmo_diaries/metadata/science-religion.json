[Ned Flanders](http://youtu.be/Dd5iDTQy1OM).\u00a0 If he'd said \"okaly dokaly\" I'd have cracked up out loud.\u00a0 \"They'd probably like him at Earlham.\"\u00a0 \"What's that supposed to mean\" (laughing).\u00a0 Then it turned out he was Quaker.\u00a0 So I was [probably right](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/11/more-election-day-news.html).\n\nPortlanders are pensive, serious thinkers.\u00a0 I'm not saying Portland is the only introspective city.\u00a0 I think it helps to have Quakers, even if only a few.\u00a0 Have esoteric Buddhist sects if you're lucky.\n\nScience and religion had been getting along pretty well.\u00a0 I was surprised he didn't mention Teilhard de Chardin.\u00a0 I asked during the Q & A if he didn't think the best religions could still be ahead of us.\u00a0 Instead of trying to make the old ones get along better, why aren't we busier inventing new ones.\u00a0 We've learned a lot from these many civilizations, why not kick start a bunch of new ones?\u00a0 Philip responded with the idea of retro-fitting or rehabilitating old ones.\u00a0 Much more could be done with the teachings of Jesus than Christianity had ever yet tried, so why not re-animate from within an existing tradition?\u00a0 I guess I wouldn't see it as either / or.\u00a0 Inventing new religions is likewise a process of reinventing old religions.\u00a0 Kneed that clay.\n\nAnyway (about twenty years ago was it?) that science / religion rapprochement all went kablooey and a major culture war got underway in which science and religion would appear to fight in a bitter way again.\n\nFor many, this felt like a throw back detour into a darker age.\n\nClayton's plea, transmitting Bronowski's (I remember that guy, a TV personality), was that we overcome the current impasse, the either / or mentality, and stop getting in one anothers' way.\u00a0 Portlanders couldn't find much to argue with there and left the theater upbeat, was my impression.\n\nTara and I adjourned to the dinner, joining Jeff and a co-worker from Rumblefish.\u00a0 The waiters were generous with me in particular when pouring red, perhaps for kindnesses exchanged, or so it seemed to me and Don.\u00a0 Missed Nirel\u00a0 (CSN) and other favorite people -- some just because they were at other tables, and we left before too late.\n\nWe seemed a small crowd.\u00a0 Terry quizzed Tara about where she was going to college.\u00a0 We talked about her 3rd place win in the state in a team she co-founded and co-led to glory.\n\nI've been very privileged to have been a father twice over, plus there's always [that dad vibe](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/06/fathers-day.html).\u00a0 The orbit through this theater, this hotel, has been a nurturing and satisfying one.\u00a0 My thanks to Terry and the much larger cast that makes it possible, out to Mentor Graphics and beyond.\n\nWe also talked about DMSO and MSM, both stocked on the health food aisle.\u00a0 You should not be surprised when close to the Linus Pauling neighborhood that you hear lots of complicated \"molecule talk\" regarding the possible pathways whereby the various ingredients might do their work.\u00a0 Terry talked about chemical \"chaperons\" in the body, which may accompany complex molecules with a propensity to miss-fold, thanks to some inherited defect, and cause them to fold correctly nevertheless (hence the term \"chaperon\" although \"coach\" and/or \"guardian\" might also gain traction).\n\nAfter this enjoyable night out and some time with other Wanderers (ISEPP's cultish fandom), I retreated to the bat cave to catch up with my work.\u00a0 Lots of people have an interest in Python these days.\u00a0 Yes, I help whip that up, not ashamed to say that I do, no siree.\u00a0 Here's a computer language that can take you places.\u00a0 Not a waste of time to learn.\u00a0 Steve, just back from points east, is in the same line of work.\n\nFor followup:\u00a0 daft punk & IVM (back to designing those religions, Subgenius at work).\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/7119846175/)",
