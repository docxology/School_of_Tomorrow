  "content": "As Patrick roved through the aisles, looking for some esoteric H-bridge for his Arduino, I thought about STEM and workflows.\u00a0 I know some teachers who complement each other as TM versus SE.\u00a0 Science and Engineering = electronic hardware at Fry's.\u00a0 TM = Technology and Mathematics, the computer and the math that controls it.\n\nLater I brought Peter Farrell by the <guild / > to show him the space, at least some of it.\u00a0 We parked some distance away and wended our way through the International School campus.\u00a0 He liked what he saw, and is eager to continue sharing our blend, of Pythonic math, in the Bay Area.\n\nNow that I have a full weekend to catch up on some of what I've learned, from QuantumDoug and many others, I find myself plunging into some literature on Clifford Algebra.\u00a0 They say off hand a computer language might be made from this stuff, and I've found a module in SymPy to look at.\n\nSpeaking of Universal Algebra, I'm continuing to circulate the somewhat freakish [\"caltrop\" coordinate system](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/09/manga-on-mul.html) introduced to the Synergetics listserv awhile back by David Chako.\u00a0 Many of us picked up the ball and ran with it, seeing connections to Synergetics for a shared context.\u00a0 Just this morning I uploaded to Github, a [modified version of the code](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/qrays.py) at my website, newly tested to work with Python 3.x.",
