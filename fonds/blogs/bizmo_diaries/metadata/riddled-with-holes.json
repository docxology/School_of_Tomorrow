  "content": "The way Fuller presented his philosophy was as mostly space but then also framed windows in a kind of spider webby networky sense, gossamer, ephemeral, ectoplasmic (ghostly shmear). \u00a0Windows being the O in V + O = E + 2, O for Opening. \u00a0Like left by bullet holes.\n\nStar Wars adapted Earthian war movies, adapted from war itself, to an alien environment (long ago, far away) but kept the \"war torn\" or \"battle-worn\" look. \u00a0Things were dented and dirty, not pristinely shiny as if just off the showroom floor. \u00a0That touch alone gave it a flavor of realism that movie-goers relished.\n\nI'm not saying Star Wars was the first or only pioneer. \u00a0[Aliens](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/?ref_=nv_sr_1) was banged up in its own way. \u00a0Science fiction as a literary form has always had that broken and bruised look. \u00a0Movies maybe took awhile to catch up?\n\nAnyway, Synergetics is like that, some kind of bullet-ridden battle star, definitely a spheroid. \u00a0He's been polemical this Bucky, and look at these scars here. \u00a0Wow, pretty rugged. \u00a0There's grudging respect.\n\nBut also outrage, like David was pointing out, [the 1950s table](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/s09/figs/tb6310.html) with some early Synergetics Constant stuff. \u00a0What's up with that Dodecahedron of 12 Hexagons? \u00a0Say what? \u00a0It's a communist er capitalist er insect people plot, to put stupid mistakes like that in the public record and let them stand. \u00a0How could a mistake like that get through the editors? \u00a0Makes Bucky look bad, like he can't count [fingers and toes](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/quaker-preschool.html).\n\nI'm arguing there weren't that many layers of editor and Synergetics is both meticulous and \"thrown together\" as Cosmic Fishing shares the tale. \u00a0There isn't that editorial oversight you might enjoy if settled in and enjoying a well-diagrammed workflow. \n\nThink of Donald Knuth, for example. \u00a0I just got his four volumes in the mail. \u00a0He's been meticulously organized. \u00a0Fuller was just dragging papers around in his suitcase and relying on Applewhite for the meticulous part. \u00a0I'm not saying that was in any way unwise, as EJA upheld his side of the bargain and then some, but it's not the controlled processing of errata we might have had, and still may have. \n\nBob Gray did a superb job of getting the opus reliably transcribed. \u00a0Version control going forward? Big project. \u00a0Notice I haven't stepped forward. \u00a0I just [got on Github](https://github.com/4dsolutions/BookCovers) like yesterday for the first time.\n\nSynergetics is also wildly speculative. \u00a0Linus Pauling got that way too. \u00a0You've got a front row seat in high stakes poker and you just throw down the hand you've got, in hopes of winning at least something. \u00a0Pauling's proposal for DNA was [inside-out impossible](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/05/brilliant-blunders.html), a freak, but with that many horses in that many races, how might we not have a freak or two?\n\nLike where he compares a T-module to a Meson on something like that. \u00a0He's shoving chips on his quanta modules having some future in some quantum mechanics but how do you \"shove chips\" in 1970 without just speaking nonsense? \n\nPerhaps nonsense was a best option; the author of Finnegans Wake certainly seemed to think so. \u00a0Here's a literary figure with a tiger by the tail, a fun new geometry, and he's determined to make the most of it. \u00a0\"Evidence of partying\" the police report might say later. \u00a0But can you blame him? \u00a0He confesses to being pee-in-the-pants excited sometimes. \u00a0He got passionate about this stuff.\n\nBut that doesn't excuse all the mistakes and transgressions does it? \u00a0Not in my own case either. \u00a0I shouldn't act like I'm apologizing for Bucky when I have my own harrowing Kafkaesque case to be concerned with. \u00a0But then \"apologist\" or \"disciple\" have never been my chosen terms. \u00a0I'm definitely a fan of certain people, where \"fan\" connotes \"from afar\". \n\nI'm a fan of [Katie Couric](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/06/mortal-coil.html), [Walter Kaufmann](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/02/philosophy-101.html), [Stuart Kauffman](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/04/reinventing-sacred.html)... [Alan Watts](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/10/satori.html), lots of people, some of whom I've actually met. \u00a0Bucky was somewhat in that category, though like Kiyoshi I was experiencing metaphysical eddying. \u00a0I think I've talked about [his experiences before](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/kiyoshi.html). \u00a0The collective unconscious is a busy place, lets put it that way. \u00a0Friends are people I'm fans of but get to spend more time with, Sam Lanahan for example.\n\nWe kept a low profile this Halloween. \u00a0Steve had had knee surgery. \u00a0The Barton kids are still young enough, and their porch is just right. \u00a0Glenn came by. \u00a0Thai food was enjoyed. \u00a0Trick or treaters got their candy and maybe shook the fake hand.",
