I've been looking at this practice through a framework of comparisons with Hizmet.\n\nBoth religious movements were at first embraced by their respective governments, Turk and Chinese, then demonized.\u00a0 Turkey holds US citizens hostage hoping to extradite Gulen in exchange.\n\nI was unaware that Hoover had been a mining engineer.\u00a0 His determination to feed Belgium at the height of the blockade jibed with Human Smoke and his Quaker values.\u00a0 He seemed happiest and/or most fulfilled when serving as some kind of chief of logistics.\n\nI'll need to cycle back through his bio again soon.\n\nMike Pence, per this New Yorker analysis, has always been interested in serving as a US president.\u00a0 He's a heartbeat away at this moment, but at a time when said high office is waning in power?\u00a0 The west coast has escaped Prohibition (the later chapter) and no longer supports the Drug Wars unless that means against McKesson etc.\n\nI don't just browse print media however.\u00a0 Last night I was half comatose letting Youtube keep picking the next one.\u00a0 I'd surface from my somnolent state from time to time, curious what I'd been brainwashing myself with.\u00a0 Louis Farrakhan?\u00a0 Just his fans?\u00a0 Back to dream land.\n\nI have a big screen facing me, while I recline on the futon couch.\n\nI'm also active on my Kindle these days reading a Hoover Institution fellow's book from the 1990s, Inside American Education by [Thomas Sowell](http://www.tsowell.com/).\n\nHe seems respectful of Bayard Rustin, who had Freedom House connections.\u00a0 Freedom House is quoted in that Falun Gong brochure, attesting to the reality of organ harvesting.\u00a0 That calls to mind [another Youtube](https://youtu.be/a6-eo6bh87g).\n\nI visited Indiana around the time Pence made himself more enemies in the alt-gender community.\u00a0 I guess it's OK with him to do that.\u00a0 He defines himself as rigidly parochial Christian, not a cosmopolitan.\n\nGlenn and I watched Portland Timbers win the Cascadia Cup from Back Stage / Bagdad.\n\nDinner with mom at Thanh Thao.\u00a0 Need sleep.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/37870183541/in/dateposted-public/)",
