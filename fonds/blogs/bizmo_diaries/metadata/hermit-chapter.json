  "content": "This chapter, following Alabama Adventure, is soon to end, as I plot [a next trip](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/01/new-years-day-2018.html).\n\nHowever, I'm glad for this heated cave with WiFi.\u00a0 I'm working on some new course-ware, written in Sphinx, and wrote an essay on Medium about [my latest thoughts](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/whats-the-best-way-to-teach-python-675d4bfbdebd) on teaching Python.\n\nI did get out this afternoon, to visit The Good Bye Party family, out towards Gresham.\u00a0 I took the Max. Great homemade pear wine!\u00a0 I learned so much, hanging out with this younger bunch.\n\nTonight I'm listening to [A Man of Letters](http://amanofletters.com/) reading from Undercover Mormon by Th. Metzger. I do this as I blog, upload pictures, and make a long overdue backup.",
