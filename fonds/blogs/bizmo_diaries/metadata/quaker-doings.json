  "content": "Carol (mom) and I are at the meetinghouse for what promises to be an all day meeting. \u00a0Joyce was somewhat disapproving of my showing up with a Diet Dr. Pepper, but as long as I don't take it in the meeting room, Quaker doctrine specifies no problemo with caffeine (68 mg per 20 fl oz). \u00a0Our Coordinating Committee (NPYM CC) clerk is still coming in from the airport (PDX).\n\nAnnis is here at the table with Carol and I, along with two others from out of state. \u00a0Some people have traveled some distance for this meeting. \u00a0We happen to live in the neighborhood and often walk it, even Carol (with a walker) but today we took the car. \u00a0Someone was in the wheelchair parking slot (a Volvo) so we went to the Mazama's parking lot next door (that's an arrangement we've worked out).\n\nI'm here as Technology Clerk for the region. \u00a0We have fairly light IT needs (event registration, a regional directory, a website) but I still regard our work as cutting edge, as how Quakerism embraces or shuns technology is in many ways going to be definitive of its future profile in the world. \u00a0I want clerking, as a role, to include SQL / noSQL savvy, as a matter of course. \u00a0Computer literacy is simply literacy, in this day and age.\n\nChoosing to meet on an important holiday, Halloween, was a mistake I think.\u00a0 Our NPYM Secretary was unable to attend for this reason, as it's a major business day in her line of work.\u00a0 She's the paid staff in this picture.\u00a0 The rest of us are volunteering. \n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/22529842721/in/dateposted-public/)",
