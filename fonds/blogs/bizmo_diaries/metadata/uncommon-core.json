  "content": "You may or may not be familiar with \"uncommon core\" (meme), depending on if we've lowered a rope in your zip code area.\u00a0 That's what we've done in Portland, regarding spatial geometry especially.\u00a0 The skeptics say there's no future in Polyhedrons, ever since Bourbaki mainly.\u00a0 The Canadians have overtaken their neighbors to the south, in both AI and extended Euclideanism (ala Coxeter).\n\nNew England Transcendentalism, so-called, later simply American Transcendentalism, hooked its star to this Canadian memeplex, in the sense that the Synergetics \"bible\" (numbered passages) is dedicated to University of Toronto guru \"Dr. Donald\" as some affectionately know him.\u00a0 Formerly a student of Wittgenstein's at Cambridge.\u00a0 AI (ML) took some leaps and bounds at the same academy.\n\nThe Uncommon Core needs you to learn more about coding.\u00a0 We'll compare and contrast functional with object oriented, but we refuse to abandon either in some religious war.\u00a0 World Domination made sense for FOSS (another meme, needs a different word in Arabic).\u00a0 It doesn't make sense for some subsect in programming to stake that claim.\u00a0 So yes, we keep using Python, along with myriad other languages with a Jupyter Notebook like shell (or use JN itself in the case of Python, Haskell...).\n\nYou might think I'm talking college here, and I am, as Uncommon Core excels at that level, however I talked about \"lowering a rope\" which means to the littler people, the kids.\u00a0 Andragogy meets pedagogy.\u00a0 You may have read my Pythonic Andragogy essay on LinkedIn.\n\nI'm not trying to make stuff happen in every zip code.\u00a0 Oregon Curriculum Network is named that for a reason.\u00a0 Yes, I have meetups with people not from around here, and we compare notes, trade memes and artifacts, help stock our respective inventories with educational supplies.\u00a0 But I know better than to dabble in zip codes (shorthand for \"micro-regions\") where I have no clue how things operate.\u00a0 I'm not one to just parachute in and take charge.\u00a0 I'm into organic growth and all that.\n\nHowever, given the Coffee Shops Network as another vector, less parochial sounding than Oregon Curriculum Network, you can find a cyber-footprint from pretty much anywhere.\u00a0 If you have an LCD, we have the animations or ideas for storyboards.\u00a0 You'll bring your own ideas to the table.\u00a0 Synergy happens.\u00a0 I don't need to leave my zip code to make the magic happen.",
