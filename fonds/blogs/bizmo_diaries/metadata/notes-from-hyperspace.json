introduced me to Quantopian, which I also stumbled upon while following [the Jupyter story](https://youtu.be/BCLgXjxYONg).\u00a0 Jupyter is spin-off from the I-Python Notebook project, refactored to be more generalized, with the Python bits separate.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI've been using nbviewer (Notebook viewer) for it's intended purpose:\u00a0 to render public Jupyter Notebooks given the URL.\u00a0 I have two examples [saved at Github](https://github.com/4dsolutions/Python5), which I yak about more on mathfuture.\n\nGithub also renders Jupyter Notebooks natively, but with more restrictions.\u00a0 For example to see the embedded Youtubes in my example, one needs to [let nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/4dsolutions/Python5/blob/master/STEM%20Mathematics.ipynb?flush_cache=true) do the rendering. \n\nO'Reilly, a former employer, has been jumping on [the Jupyter bandwagon](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/jupyter-at-oreilly), supporting an Open Source project of its own called [Thebe](https://oreillymedia.github.io/thebe/).\u00a0 Jupyter is experimenting with adding workflows that would enable the kind of work cycle we enjoyed at O'Reilly School.\n\nHowever when it comes to learning programming, I don't see the Notebook as a replacement for the IDE.\u00a0 These are two different genres of software.\u00a0 That's why the Anaconda distro comes with Spyder (an IDE) and not just I-Python Notebook. \n\nI'm upbeat about all this technology and its Open Source foundations and share about it with my bevy of students in California, to whom I recommend the Anaconda distro from Continuum Analytics.\u00a0 I also share my enthusiasm for PythonAnywhere.\n\nI've had three posts so far accepted for publication by the CERM Academy, a risk management focused cyber-place.\n\nThought for the day (TFTD):\u00a0 given we call it \"hypertext\" as in HTTP and HTML, why not start referring to cyberspace as likewise hyperspace?\n\nWe reserve hyperspace for science fiction meanings only?\u00a0 As a literary device, it explains near-instantaneous inter-planetary travel.\n\nGiven we do not really have that physics pinned down, but do have the cyber-thing going, why not loosen the grip of the fiction writers and take a step towards reality?\n\nMy friend Gene Fowler, the poet / ex-con who discovered Bucky and Synergetics \"on the inside\" (in San Quentin), thought \"hyper\" really meant little more than \"wow\" or \"gosh\" and so all this hypertext talk was to his ear was somewhat immature-sounding, like \"wow-text\" or maybe \"golly-gee-wiz-text\".\n\nI would argue that thanks to science fiction, our meaning for \"hyper\" had evolved to a more geometric picture, of how locales could all interconnect, by means of \"secret tunnels\" if you will.\u00a0 That image carries over in this proposed \"new\" application of the \"hyperspace\" concept.\n\nAnyway it's not about Uncle Sam being \"locked out\", only not having the right to insist on Grunch dumbing itself down just to please the District of Columbia.\n\nDC is less powerful than Wall Street according to Bernie Sanders, who oughta know, and Wall Street watches the rest of the world in hopes of seeing its quantopian dreams coming true.\n\nA track record of extremist, immoderate policies, both foreign and domestic, has dispelled any illusions that DC is to be given the car keys; too many DUIs, too much driving under the influence of debilitating mindsets.",
