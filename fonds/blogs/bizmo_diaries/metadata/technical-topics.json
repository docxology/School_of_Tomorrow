The city would be designed for mass evacuations, more a way station than a destination, and not the last of its kind.\n\nWhile I\u2019m doodling in my head along those lines, I\u2019m showcasing the bread and butter stack and content. Everyone in my business has a stack. I\u2019m wearing a Supermarket Math hat now, thinking in terms of what\u2019s in inventory. Does anyone remember LAMP? Linux Apache MySQL P-language (e.g. Perl, Python, PHP). That\u2019s a good example of a classic stack, and a doorway into cloud-based architecture.\n\nI told Paul I thought we were in some National Geographic article, about Oregonians in October, harvesting something like beer hops, but with crazier names for strains. \u00a0Paul and I have a collaborative relationship based on a practice Glenn established. \u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about Glenn a lot today, and of my mother, two people I lost in the last year. Paul is a retired chef with a luxury hotel background, specializing in Anglo-French cuisine. He reminds us of our buddy Steve Holden who used to live in the same apartment complex. Yes, a past chairman of the Python Software Foundation and conference organizer who helped get the Pycons going.\n\nYou may find more about Steve by searching these journals. I tended to accompany him to these conferences he would organize, as one of the people on hand to keep things on track. Djangocon, Apachecon\u2026 some even more obscure ones, always excellent in their own way, as Steve knew a thing or two and relied on Nancy and her team, out of Orlando.\n\nRegarding the showcasing I\u2019m doing, the embedded screen shot above is one you can click on to gain access to its original context, where a much bigger and higher resolution view is available. Here\u2019s a direct link. You\u2019ll find I\u2019m going on about a certain \u201cNCLB Polyhedron\u201d where NCLB = No Child Left Behind, a meme from the Obama years. I was trying to get Phi (the golden ratio) a more exalted place in the curriculum.\u00a0\n\nThe meme was somewhat tongue in cheek, more like something a MAD magazine might run with, versus a sober upstanding mass-published mathematics textbook devoid of social commentary. I was engaged in the andragogical practice of preserving a level of comic edginess that helps me retain the attention of certain readers (mainly fans of mine).\n\nAny number of secular mathematicians will testify that Phi is harmless and is easily shared in a curriculum context that has nothing to do with demons or devils (we\u2019re coming up on Halloween here). I hope I\u2019m not being too cryptic. The golden mean crops up in connection with five-fold symmetry geometric gizmos long associated with various cults (or call them subcultures) savvy about this specific aesthetic.\n\nThis version of the Notebook does not yet contain much in the way of graphics. I\u2019m focused on sympy, the Python library, and its equation-solving capabilities.\n\nAsylum City would provide more opportunities for denizens to watch shows and start catching up on their own situation as seen from different angles. The Gazans, like the Ukrainians, would get that the world cares about them and in turn is eager to develop its generic ability to manage refugees in a humane way. If climate change hits the way some think it will, we\u2019ll be glad for the practice. \u00a0However the need is real even today.\n\nWe have the need for skillful rehabilitation programs on a large scale almost everywhere, as people seek a better life in another set of circumstances.",
