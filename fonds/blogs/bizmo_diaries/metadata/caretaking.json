She was afraid of dogs at first, but developed a bond with said mutt.\n\nToday I headed over to Glencoe, where I'm shepherding kids through an after school program.\u00a0 If you dig around in my blogs, you'll find more.\n\nFriendly Care has been supportive.\u00a0 Maye Thompson let me in to borrow a wheelchair from the medical equipment library, founded by Alberta Gerould.",
