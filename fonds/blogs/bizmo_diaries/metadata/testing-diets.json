  "content": "Doug Strain volunteered as a guinea pig during [human subjects trials](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/09/wanderers-200597.html) for the military.\u00a0 He preferred to be in a freezing box car, eating various gruels, than being ordered by others to open fire or whatever.\n\nThe military study ascertained that a high protein diet was necessary to counter extreme cold, an unhappy outcome in the judgement of various bean counters, who were hoping cheap lard, maybe wax, would be the ticket.\n\nSpeaking of diet, schools that have switched to healthier fare have sometimes noticed dramatic improvements in student mood and attentiveness.\n\nI'm sure there's some truth in the view that just sending the message one cares enough to improve the cafeteria offerings (add a salad bar) begets reciprocation, but there's even more truth in the view that a healthier diet helps stabilize and improve mood.\n\nFood Not Bombs sometimes tests that theory by providing \"green gruel\" (as if we're back in that box car with Doug), somewhat like Popeye's spinach, to front liners into today's psycho-battles. \n\nDo the tent people brighten up as they get more fresh Willamette Valley produce, rescued from a composting room when still in prime condition?\u00a0 If they do in schools, why not in tent cities?\n\nI've been a consultant for the Oregon Food Bank and respect the personnel and professionalism I encountered.\n\nI also have no special ax to grind against Fritos or the Frito-Lay division of Pepsi, but lets face it, if you bring home a box of Mac 'n Cheese to be followed by Doritos then Fritos, you're not very high on the food pyramid.\u00a0 It's not what the health-conscious executives eat in any of these companies, except for occasional snacks at company venues.\n\nReplacing healthy meals with snacks only is what that Supersize Me guy tried, and look how he almost died.\u00a0 I don't think the McDonald's Corporation would recommend doing the experiment he did.\u00a0 Just because one opens a roller coaster park doesn't mean one encourages addicts to ride them 24/7.\u00a0 Your company doesn't need fiends and ghouls to channel decent profits back to stakeholders.\n\nLindsey, one of the FNB cooks, was hard at it again today, throwing together a fresh fiesta salad with another pot of lightly cooked vegetables, generously spiced.\u00a0 I had a bowl of the latter, having just treated mom and myself to Burgerville, complete with milk shakes and Walla Walla onion rings.\n\nI could feel the \"two cultures\" contending for my body.\u00a0 At Burgerville, I ordered from a car.\u00a0 Lindsey takes her food downtown by bicycle.\n\nShe lives in the world like the world is a gym.\u00a0 I need a special place called a \"gym\" or I'll turn to jello.\n\nSpeaking of which, it's time for a Guinness!",
