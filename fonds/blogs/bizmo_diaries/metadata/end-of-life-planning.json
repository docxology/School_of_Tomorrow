  "content": "[The Urner family](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/whats-urner.html) has often taken in long term guests, in the Philippines, in Egypt, in other places.\u00a0 Readers of my blogs know we've given shelter to [one Lindsey Walker](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8CGdb7BrBY), a political refugee one might say, escaping a more repressive state.\n\nThe \"host\" role is quite a bit different from the \"landlord\" role, but any lawyer will tell you it's still important to limit your liability.\u00a0 Given only two adults in the house, I have to be sure the law does not treat us like a couple, at which point assets get shmooed together.\n\nIf we were married, even if just in common law terms, and I called an ambulance, I might be held liable for those expenses.\n\nBut we're not married, not by any standard, and any medical bill I get relating to her care I'm going to return, burn, or forward to her next of kin, unless the courts somehow find me liable for her condition in the first place -- a contingency I have to keep working to prevent (I must exercise mindfulness around my fellow human beings and not cause them injury through negligence, no kidding).\n\nOne of the guys at Thirsters [the other day](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/11/a-khan-at-thirsters.html) was sorrowful because his nephew had been killed by unexploded ordinance, one of the bomblets from a cluster bomb.\n\nIf I left cluster bomblets around my house and my guests picked them up or kicked them, not knowing their true nature, then lawyers might come after me.\u00a0 I would be liable for their deaths and/or medical treatment.\n\nIndeed, as a US taxpayer, you could say that I do pay for such injuries, as whenever US employees hurt themselves on the job, they're in a position to file claims, which US borrowing and revenue will need to cover if said claims are upheld, as many are.\n\nI gave Lindsey some ultra-sonic rat repellants, devices one plugs in.\u00a0 If a rat bites her in the neck and gives her a deadly disease, people might say I was not a good host and that my humble basement was too humble.\u00a0 I'm not saying we have lots of rats, but many Portland basements are not immune from rodents, possums too in some cases.\u00a0 We have squirrels in the attic and walls.\u00a0 They're not rabid and don't usually bite humans.\n\nOne thing I'm very clear about is that even though Lindsey has very low body fat (she knows Victoria's secret or whatever) she'd be non-trivial to pick up and carry to the maxi taxi (the Nissan, which used to be hers).\n\nWe've used the Nissan for medical emergencies.\u00a0 Lindsey doesn't have health insurance or much savings and an ambulance could be ruinous to her, financially.\u00a0 As long as she's been ambulatory herself, transport by car was an option.\u00a0 I've usually been the driver.\n\nBut I'm not about to try to lift her up, if she's comatose or simply limp and delirious, and I've told her that.\u00a0 I'll call 911 and let the professionals use a stretcher.\n\nI know she wouldn't try to lift me.\u00a0 I probably weigh well over twice as much as she does.\u00a0 If I pass out in the 2nd floor office, she is not going to try lugging me down a flight of stairs and out to the Nissan just to save on some ambulance costs.\u00a0 That'd be foolish.\u00a0 She'd likely injure herself just trying it.\n\nBut I'm saying it'd be equally foolish for me to try that with her.\n\nAn acquaintance of mine told me about dragging an inebriated friend from a bar (I think it was) and how heavy that friend was.\u00a0 I believe he had help.\u00a0 Two of them were trying to drag their friend somewhere, but somehow they dropped him and he hit his head.\n\nHow it all turned out I don't remember, but the storyteller was still traumatized by the event.\u00a0 Another time I saw a father drop his little girl completely by mistake.\u00a0 He was so torn up about it, although she was fine.\n\nWhat Lindsey and I both need are contingency plans in case either one of us finds the other comatose or dead.\u00a0 911 is the default answer, but more responsible adults, or those with the time, especially later in life, start getting their affairs in order.\u00a0\u00a0 My mom has done a lot of end of life planning.\n\nSome phone number on the fridge, with a check already made out, might be the best answer.\u00a0 \"In case of death, cremate me here:\u00a0 555-XXX-YYYY.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Lindsey and I should each have that, plus make arrangements for whatever ceremonies above and beyond corpse disposal.\n\nIn Lindsey's case, I think Satya would be a good person to help out planning [ceremonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4ezPvzKe5M), notifying next of kin and so on.\u00a0 In my case, I should exercise my Oversight Committee powers and get one of those Wishes Upon Death forms in the files.\u00a0 I'd like to keep the Flickr and Facebook accounts public, my blogs.\u00a0 I should start saving whatever emails are worth keeping...\n\nPreparing for one's death is a lot of work actually.\n\nI don't like the word \"retired\" because in physics work is any energy expenditure and there's no way around spending energy, even just breathing.\u00a0 So life is work and work is life.\u00a0 Death might be the absence of work, though some might say that's just what we mean by context i.e. death is context.\u00a0 That's a metaphysical discussion for later maybe.\n\nBesides, I'm not even legally retired.\u00a0 I have a full time job.\u00a0 I did participate in [my wife's](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/03/about-dawn-brief-bio.html) end of life planning, most of which she did herself, while self employed.\u00a0 She was extremely responsible about managing her own death, having received a death sentence from her doctors (about three to six years, which she got).\n\nMoving Dawn became problematic towards the end.\u00a0 She stopped being ambulatory.\u00a0 I moved her solo one day and we realized that was not a good idea, too much pain.\u00a0 We realized we needed more help, which our community provided.\n\nI don't have any funds budgeted for Lindsey's care.\u00a0 Anything extra goes to the college where my younger daughter goes.\u00a0 Ever since the coma discussion, I've been comparing notes with other friends, including some who are lawyers and/or landlords.\u00a0 I'm trying to distill into writing what a non-lease extended house guest agreement might look like.\n\nBut then, at the end of the day she's planning to leave anyway, maybe storing some stuff in the basement, taking off for various adventures, some of them probably higher risk than anything she tries [around Portland](http://youtu.be/ZTiD0tvbONw).\u00a0 She's like a circus worker, [a tightrope walker](http://gizmodo.com/man-on-wire-how-one-man-walked-on-a-tightrope-between-513891462).\u00a0 Someone living on the edge.\u00a0 She lives her life at the limits as Walter Kaufmann would say (he thought you needed to do that to call yourself a philosopher).\n\nPeople with dangerous work need to keep their affairs in order, soldiers, philosophers, and political revolutionaries included.\n\nThat's probably why Friends have a habit of being so meticulous in their record keeping and personal affairs.\u00a0 Being a Quaker has been dangerous too, in different times and places.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhHyWGPFP5XSj5cg40W9ihyphenhyphenKdl4_s-cyEUGex73sPmX-ZqAru71KV2fWHb0wsSg9hqESgkKt1zoABviPYpLhGUwVHuTODKUDl6eJFYheQD9UqNVYQYJ2_6ZqsR2NPB-UVN6qLE-/s1600/lindsey2.jpg)",
