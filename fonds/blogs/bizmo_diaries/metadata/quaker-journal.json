  "content": "A journal used to be a diary, which maybe, one thought, might be discovered and published.\u00a0 Many Quaker journals did see the light of day in that way.\n\nOnce blogging was invented, and world readable text, I'd say the practice changed a bit.\u00a0 More people could see the point of journaling.\u00a0 But what was the point?\u00a0 Advertising?\u00a0 When what you write is potentially public, that changes the rules a little.\n\nBut maybe not by much.\u00a0 A diary or journal has another function, more Jungian, which is to process or work through, something language seems to be for in general.\u00a0 Some of us just need to write, and the journal format, nay blog, seems like something we prayed for.\u00a0 Why be ungrateful then?\n\nThe technology keeps shifting though.\u00a0 I've used a Flash widget programmed in Shockwave to share slides, but I gather that's something 3rd party.\u00a0 The browsers are phasing out Flash.\u00a0 Will I convert everything to another format?\u00a0 Or let it go?\u00a0 I converted [Xmas 2013](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/12/xmas-2013.html) tonight, just to assure myself there's a process.\n\nTaking pictures has been another part of holding it together for me.\u00a0 My way of creating some syntropy in the face of entropy.\u00a0 But is it that my pictures really matter that much?\u00a0 An opportunity was afforded me to enjoy them while they lasted, and share some while I could.\n\nNow I'm thinking of the whole [Peter Janney story](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/05/murder-mystery.html).\u00a0 What might be found of interest?\u00a0 James Jesus Angleton apparently had the same question, according to sources, poking around Mary's studio soon after her murder.",
