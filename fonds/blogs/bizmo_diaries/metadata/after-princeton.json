I found work within walking distance, as a high school teacher, and continued on in this space, renting from Mr. Chang, through other chapters of housemates.\n\nWhich house again? Immediately adjacent to the apartment building.\u00a0 No solar panels.\u00a0 Two cars.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/52524629342/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nAbove, you'll see that same apartment building with the house behind it (red balloon).  You're looking at Loews Theater on Journal Square, courtesy of Google Earth.  The alley to the left of Loews, connecting JSQ to Magnolia, our old street, was used for a scene in The Joker.  Newark was also used for that movie.\n\nNearby: The Stanley, used in a movie directed by Woody Allen. \n\nThis all happened in the early 1980s.\u00a0 By 1984, I was living on the opposite side of Manhattan, in Queens, sharing digs with Ray Simon, along with a job at McGraw-Hill courtesy of Nola Hague.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBy then, I was also on the other side of a gig with Project VOTE!, aka Americans for Civic Participation, headed by Sandy Newman.\u00a0 That was a rooming situation in Washington, DC (thanks Brenda), during the Reagan versus Mondale presidential contest.\n\nBelow:\u00a0 Journal Square, across from Loews, back in the day.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/2560252510/in/album-72157605485853546/)",
