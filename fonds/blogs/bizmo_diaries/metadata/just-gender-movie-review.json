Suicide attempts among transgendered, a leading indicator, are still way too high though.\n\nAs the movie makes clear, we're still the prisoners of yesteryear's reflex-conditioning in a lot of ways.\u00a0 When a person experiences anger welling up -- one reaction to feeling powerless in the face of fear -- that rage or wrath may seem God-given and therefore a license to righteously lash out.\n\nThose with an \"angry God\" upbringing have a tougher time dealing with transgendered family members.\u00a0 Given my own liberal upbringing and attitudes (Rome was pretty cosmopolitan), when I hear people insisting their gender was never a choice for them (I don't dispute that), my thought is even if it were, that would have been OK too.\n\nThe film uses \"transgendered\" as the umbrella term, literally showing a symbolic umbrella and putting other terms underneath it.\u00a0 In one pithy quote, one of the interviewees makes the important distinction between gender identity and sexual orientation:\u00a0 who you want to sleep with is orientation, who you want to sleep as is identity.\u00a0 There's no logical entailment connecting these two.\n\nYes, the word \"gender\" was used in place of \"sexual\" to make \"transgender\" easier to talk about -- this insight from an activist in San Francisco.\u00a0 \"Transsexual\" comes with a lot of baggage, even if some of it is lighthearted; yes I'm thinking of Tim Curry's performance in Rocky Horror Picture Show.\u00a0 Did you catch him later in Kinsey?\n\nAnother spectrum might be how much one focuses on or cares about \ngender.\u00a0 The film emphasizes repeatedly that one's gender is very \ncentral to one's identity.\u00a0 I wouldn't dispute that that's very true for\n some people however others come across as more asexual in the sense of \ncaring less, which I'm not circling as either pathological or repressed (though it may be in some cases).\n\nWhen I think back to a very young age myself, it was being human at all I had a problem with, but not in a way that was too distressing or that led me into suicidal thoughts.\u00a0 I just remember a strong sense that many other animals seemed a lot cooler than these hominids.\u00a0 I was jealous, I guess one could say.\n\nThe real pathology we all need to deal with is this thing we call \"bullying\".\u00a0 The alternative is not being a doormat, but learning more diplomatic skills.\u00a0 The right to express disapproval of what one disapproves of is not one to take away.\u00a0 Neither is it a basic right to never feel offended or insulted by others.\n\nI learned the term \"stealth trans\" from the movie i.e. some are so \nsuccessful at making the transition that they're once again closeted in a\n way, in terms of not being open about having transitioned. \n\nComedians are often our best diplomats, in terms of getting away with treating of sensitive topics that many would just get stuck within and lose their way.\u00a0 Arthur Koestler on \"why we laugh\" is worth reading.\u00a0 Laughing is often therapeutic stress relief.\u00a0 Enter the clowns and cherubs.\n\nX-refs:\n[Kinsey](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/11/kinsey-movie-review.html) (movie review)\n[Prodigal Sons](http://www.quakerquaker.org/forum/topics/reflections-on-the-transgender-conflict?commentId=2360685%3AComment%3A144410) (as mentioned on QuakerQuaker, also [here](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/02/running-from-crazy-movie-review.html) and [here](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/12/wild-movie-review.html))\n[Gender Wars](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/09/gender-wars.html)\n[Gender Again](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2014/11/gender-again.html)\n[The King of Masks](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/king-of-masks-movie-review.html) (movie review)\n[Gender Bender](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/10/gender-bender.html)",
