I'm thinking of Hoon and environs, where I've never been.\u00a0 I have some maps from dads old shelves, as a regional planner.\n\nI think of truckers as \"citizen diplomats\" with a polymath's skill set, on top of driving, involving algorithms and data structures one could call it.\u00a0 Like airplane pilots, they follow a rule book in order to safely share the public skies and public roads.\u00a0 You don't want your pilots or drivers asleep at the wheel, either figuratively or literally.\n\nI've been test piloting a kind of truck or van, a somewhat Buckaroo Banzai bizmo, that gathers intelligence about a route for the benefit of trucker simulators, kind of a Google Street View.\u00a0 However the anthropology trained personnel are scoping out more than road conditions and bottlenecks.\u00a0 They're more like Michelin, in the sense of tour guides.\u00a0 Their product tends to be software delivered and runs inside other trucks.\n\nSince \"man is the measure of all things\" i.e. since we empathize with our own engineering, I'm fine with pretending to be my own bizmo, puttering about.\u00a0 Bucky played similar mind games, being the phantom captain of his own meat puppet ship.\u00a0 Through the power of metaphor and analogy, I'm able to combine my being human with other experiences to make some pretty detailed mind's eye science fiction about Trucker World of the future. Pause to make truck noise and operate my ghost steering wheel.\n\nWhat's a \"bizmo\"?\u00a0 Business Mobile, duh.\u00a0 No one calls them that.\u00a0 They could be double deckers, sure, but might only stay within North and South Dakota, per terms of the contract\u00a0 You might have several workstations.\u00a0 You might have a caravan, with sleeping quarter bizmos a different type.\u00a0 Traveling circus.\u00a0 We're talking gypsies here.\u00a0 As always.",
