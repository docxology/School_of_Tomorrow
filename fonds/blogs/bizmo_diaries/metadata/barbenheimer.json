A new equilibrium is thereby explored (Barbies deal with more awakened Kens) -- but I'd say still not achieved, still immature -- reflecting the \"real world\" more for real in that way.Oppenheimer, in contrast, is clearly a Ken World from the start, with Barbies ancillary. What Kens do left to their own devices is stratify into strict hierarchies with labeled ranks, organizational charts galore, regarding who should CC whom, what remains \"eyes only\" to the more top ranking Kens, what's above a Ken's pay grade. The noob Kens graduating from Barbie World are still miles away from hatching a truly he-man bureaucracy.",
