  "content": "I'm hardly The Martian (Matt Damon) in the degree of XRL (extreme remote livingry) I'm using. For one thing, I'm still on Planet Earth.\u00a0 For another, I'm not far from Hwy 97, running north-south through Central Oregon.\n\nI've envisioned my international school headquarters somewhere in this area, thanks to Barbara and Ed Janoe, some Friends living right along Crooked River canyon.\u00a0 Here was the dramatic landscape my school needed, along with the horses, alpacas, and obsidian flows.\u00a0 Smith Rock is a world class rock climbers' destination.\u00a0 We could also teach bungee jumping.\n\nLew Frederick, Oregon State senator, was by the Linus Pauling House recently, on Hawthorne.\u00a0 I shared with him my fear that [Rajneesh Puram](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/07/rajneeshpuram-movie-review.html) might have poisoned the well (pun intended -- the group used to poison people) in terms of Oregonians accepting an international cast with a footprint in this rural paradise, outside Portland.\u00a0 Xenophobia is sometimes born not of ignorance, but of real contact with an aggressor.\n\nAnother vision I shared with Lew, spelled out more in these blogs, is the whole concept of [off the grid camps](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/09/reality-tv.html), harvesting their own energy and food, ala New Alchemy Institute and Whole Earth Catalog.\n\nWe've come a long way since the 1960s, tech-wise if not in political maturity, and engineering firms need [venues to showcase](http://grunch.net/archives/41) that inspire the public imagination, if seeking markets for their civilian lines.\u00a0 They have war theater to showcase killingry and do so routinely.\n\n\"[EPCOT West](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/07/epcot-west.html)\" (a meme) was born out of Dignity Village, near PDX International.\u00a0 Do you want to [experience XRL](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/xrl-in-switzerland.html) for real?\u00a0 Instead of another make-shift shanty town, Portland would show off the new products and offer tours.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nMercyCorps has headquarters here.\u00a0 Refugee camps around the world are looking to the Pacific Northwest to innovate.\u00a0 The international school students will feed into our deployment crews, having trained with the equipment and taken in the bigger picture, of a world that works for everyone.\n\nI didn't come out here in a recruiting van, or bizmo.\u00a0 The [art car](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/09/art-car.html) made it over the mountain.\u00a0 I've got my gear.\u00a0 At the moment, I've got WiFi.\n\nAnother Friend, Aime\u00e9 Ford Conner, helped me come up with a name for this project:\u00a0 [Project Earthala](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/08/project-earthala.html).\u00a0 That could also be the name of an eco-village established by the project, and featuring the latest in XRL.\n\nI'm looking ahead to a kind of international tourism that doubles as a kind of work-study. \u00a0 However tourism has been taken over by military touring in large degree, in tandem with the rise of idiocracy, and that's tainting many brands, and frustrating the civilian markets.\u00a0 We continue to experience high levels of squalor on Ghetto Planet.",
