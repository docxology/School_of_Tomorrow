figure.\u00a0 As mortals, we only get to pop up the periscope for a short period, assembling all the puzzle pieces we can.\n\nDefinitely we need to always do the detective work to figure out who stands to gain from one \"theory\" or another.\u00a0 Real science should not inhibit \"follow the money\" style anthropology, a kind of investigative journalism with more philosophy, more distance.\u00a0 Keep an eye on the agenda.\u00a0 Does it involve \"white supremacy\" of some kind?\u00a0 Not that only \"whites\" can be racist.\u00a0 That meme virus is widespread.\u00a0 The US is [a racist society](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-race.html) (according to the four criteria presented).\n\nI don't know how far back we should push any kind of maritime savvy, on the part of these hominds.\u00a0 That's probably the kind of question I would have asked.\u00a0 Did Homo Erectus ever take a ferry of any kind?\u00a0 We hominids always walked a lot, but did we float, even navigate?\n\nRiding other animals (e.g. horses), when did that start?\u00a0 At different times for different peoples. \n\nAn ethnicity may be defined in many respects in terms of how it casts and treats other animals, not just other human beings.\n\nOMSI has an exhibit on Race even now.\u00a0 I feel I've probably seen it before, or maybe I just saw part of it.\u00a0 Anyway, I'll be heading down there one of these days to check it out. \n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/10102256786/)\n\n\"races of man\" on a timeline\u00a0\n\nat McMenamins E Broadway Brewpub",
