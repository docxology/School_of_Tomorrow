Laura was singing a moody birthday song when I got here, then turned the stage over to [Lindsey Walker](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/experience-music.html) who is driving that Yamaha keyboard hard, delivering her unique and edgy sound.\n\nHer Freedom Train is not to be missed. Everybody's Stupid expresses a darkly militant solipsism born of disillusionment, yet tinged with humor. Her Sex Doll, sung by the Laura, Lindsey on keyboard, Rick on guitar, all contributing vocals, is a true tour de force.\n\nDr. Tag and Beth have joined me, the blogger in the corner, [geekazoid](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=geekazoid) publisher of vintage brands of [kookaholic gibberish](http://www.freelists.org/post/wittrs/On-Distinction-Logic-Grammar-and-Cookery,5) (can't get enough eh?).\n\nI'm thinking about [our Wanderers at sea](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/wanderers-2009818.html) quite a bit, hoping that adventure is going OK.",
