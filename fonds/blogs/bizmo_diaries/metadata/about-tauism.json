  "content": "This Khan Academy classic is worth projecting in a \nclassroom.\u00a0 I know I would be eager to share it, if back in high school \nteaching, like in the good old days\n\nI'm not suggesting I'd turn my whole curriculum over to Sal, just that I'm \nup for sampling choice pieces by authors I admire, Vi Hart another one \n(good at math video as [an art form](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/03/wanderers-2016316.html)).\u00a0 This retrospective by Khan, \ncombined with a polemic at the end, seems a great high point to cite.\n\nThe\n math classroom of the future, in one of its many forms, casts the \nteacher in the role of VJ (video DJ) in a lot of ways.\n\nMost clips might\n be of lesser length than Khan's average, although some teachers might \ninvest in a full series of something, with their own time at the podium,\n as emcee and expert, to apply local spin, relate it to actual students \nmore directly (personalize, make it real, take questions).\n\nIt's \nup to the teachers and lesson planners to glue the samplings into \ncoherent pathways that come together to produce whole concepts.\u00a0 The \nteacher may improvise a good portion of the presentation, yet there's a \nknown terrain, the school's agreed-upon curriculum, what it's known for.\n\nThe fact remains that \"citing video\" is a lot like a VJ's job and editing \nvideo is the \"anime\" equivalent of doing \"manga\" or \"stills\" (picture \nJupyter Notebooks with still graphics courtesy of matplotlib).\n\nIn the \ngraphical arts, manga equals comic books, anime equals cartoons.\n\nIn \nmathematics, one needs both.\n\nSal covers a lot of ground in the above video, looking back, reviewing trig functions, radians, the whole idea of pi.\u00a0 \n\nThen comes his impassioned defense of tau (as 2 pi).\u00a0 He uses tau's \nappearance on the stage as an excuse to quickly review the whole board \nonce again, having set us up the first time with a critique of Euler's \nFormula, arguably the most beautiful in math, but having a flaw, a \nblemish.\n\nI don't see any either/or here really.\u00a0 Use tau in place of pi when it's prettier.\u00a0 Why not?\n\nHowever\n at this juncture it's worth mentioning another low intensity tug-o-war \nin which tau is involved.\u00a0 Versus Phi.\u00a0 There's been some debate about \nwhether tau stands for .618... i.e. the reciprocal of 1.618...\u00a0 \n\nSome authors use tau for the latter, however the convention I'm most \nfamiliar with assigns Greek letter phi to 1.618... and tau to its \nreciprocal (0.618...).\u00a0 In English or other romanized (\"ascii-fied\") \ntexts, we may use phi in place of the Greek letter.\u00a0 Then comes the low \nintensity debate whether to pronounce it \"fee\" or \"fie\".\u00a0 A contingent \nsays it both ways.\u00a0 Maybe one should say \"fee\" on odd days of the week?\n\nQuoting [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio):\n\nSince\n the 20th century, the golden ratio has been represented by the Greek \nletter \u03c6 (phi, after Phidias, a sculptor who is said to have employed \nit) or less commonly by \u03c4 (tau, the first letter of the ancient Greek \nroot \u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ae\u2014meaning cut).\n\nWhat I suggest coming\n from a liberal arts background is we remind students of mathematics \nthat debate is a feature (not a bug) of their discipline and circle \nthese simple examples, in preparation for investigating bigger debates \nin lessons to come.\n\nWhen Sal comes back around again, reviewing the board, the trig functions, the unit circle, he shows that \nEuler's formula may be made even more beautiful.\u00a0\u00a0 By that time some of \nus are ready to vote for Sal's argument, especially with the caveat that\n pi is not hereby banned.\u00a0 These constants do not compete so much as \nreinforce one another.\n\nAs for phi versus tau, I think we've pretty much settled on tau being the reciprocal of the golden \nmean, which golden mean is itself > 1, i.e. is 1.618... or (1 + \nrt2(5))/2 -- note that I sometimes replace sqrt() with rt2() as I don't \nwant to push the mental model to favor \"squares\" too prejudicially, \ngiven the triangle-friendly balance of this curriculum (Martian Math \ninspired)).\n\nEspecially if tau is going of to do \nyeoman's service as 2 pi, replacing 2 pi r with tau r in many a Jupyter \nNotebook, all the more reason, then, to not force it to do double duty \nas the golden ratio as well.\n\nThat'd only add to the post Babel \nconfusion, not that I expect any posting by me to serve as an edict.\u00a0 \nThe post Babel confusion (not everyone on the same page) is more what \nI'm drawing attention to, as another lens for viewing math.\n\nTune in the\n debates for a change.\u00a0 Listen to arguments.\n\nKirby\n\n[Additional reading / links](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2246748&tstart=0)\n[](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=2246748&tstart=0)\n\n[originally a post to mathfuture, a Google Group]",
