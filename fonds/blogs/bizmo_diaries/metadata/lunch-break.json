  "content": "Long time readers of these blogs will remember Glenn Stockton, both a handy-man caretaker, really great with tools thanks to much off-the-grid living, even raising a family that way, and a scholar.\u00a0\n\nHe haunts the Good Will sometimes, knowing it's a place to score finds and today found a really great condition copy of a classic by Linus Pauling and E. Bright Wilson, which one is welcome to [read for free](https://archive.org/details/introductiontoqu031712mbp) on the Web:\n\nNot that this book is light reading by any means.  Pauling was a good clear writer in general though, Glenn points out, and I assume Wilson was too.\n\nHe also shared several other titles which you can take a look at by entering my Flickr Photostream, by clicking on either picture above.",
