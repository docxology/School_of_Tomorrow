Applewhite, is an inventory of Fuller's precise usage patterns around sometimes familiar words (but here with a new [spin](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/name-collisions.html)).\n\nFuller attached a lot of importance to clear communication, saying he'd rather be not understood than misunderstood.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjW0nbpuHdC_XsKu2W9iC-FFPUqdpZXqqn11dH1yOC0ZplqsRujzuMQdwW8OmB25sp6vetmtbrJv1NFqcZES5zLvFNhnRgW-eZOIODJWasVZDCeYEeO_tgWY1AR-QYjL_Ru2O_7/s1600-h/syndict3.jpg)Depicted above is the beginning of a multi-panel foldout at the beginning of the first volume (A-E). \n\nHere Fuller is noting that the number of ways n random experiences completely interconnect is the triangular number (n+1)*n/2 or 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15..., which triangles may be stacked into a growing tetrahedron of experiences -- a primitive model of Universe in Synergetics.\n\n\"I am not a creator, I am a swimmer, a dismisser of irrelevances\" J. Baldwin quotes from the dictionary, in his blurb for the Whole Earth Review (Summer, 1987).\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIa538Ml5A2TdR4eyPZ3Z4DQraNI-lw3By-6F0hJtiftnwJG0AUKxSdTBrYzrqw2-LNgeLNcxkB1Zh5ZNYYXwWyZqEy1xpOAF049MQFGJAmY2so0svw0SrimJaK1QaXmF2vyOE/s1600-h/syndict2.jpg) Applewhite uses this motif, of six relationships among four experiences, as a graph (the \"linear tetrahedron\"), and explicitly as a tetrahedron, as a colophon to the dictionary (Garland Publishing, New York and London, 1986).\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrXRp2i2J7DbwVH0roWMnMyB6KhVqxd-lWKI6PDI-XUaX3edLymmo_3rr1PgbN3yad_HLCV0e-Px0EudD8Q_SMSMiElM4n0cA4D0eS1T2D84R2WuoVhIngiCFlN9cwOVP8pqwA/s1600-h/syndict1.jpg)This fold-out illustration by Fuller (Sept 11, 1963) is double sided, so what's shown above is only the 2nd half of it.\n\nMy copy was a gift from [Ed himself](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/02/ayatollah-of-tetrahedron.html), retrieved from the attic of his Georgetown apartment that time Matt and I visited, enroute from Montclair, NJ to Whittier, CA, driving my sister's car (she'd moved across country). This treasure made it home safely and I've consulted it ever since.",
