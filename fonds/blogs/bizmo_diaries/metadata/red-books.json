Tarnas, Ph.D. (a self-confessed [Elvynchyk](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/at-work.html)).\u00a0 She's talking [about similarities](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/10/science-fiction-future.html) between [J.R.R. Tolkien's imagery](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/09/toontalk.html) and [that of Carl Jung](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/red-book-not-maos.html), in their respective books with red covers.",
