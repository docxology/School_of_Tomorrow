  "content": "Some of you may have realized that a fleet of bizmos (business mobiles) and a fleet of trucks, might serve in complementary capacities.\u00a0 The bizmos need to pave the way for our citizen diplomats by visiting truck stops and talking up the program.\n\nSoon:\u00a0 drivers and their apprentices will be coming through here, from faraway lands.\u00a0 Some will be homesick.\u00a0 We're not trying to make them suffer unnecessarily.\u00a0 Perhaps we have movies in their native language?\n\nRemember, the standard bizmo comes with an ability to download an image from the cloud, your image, such that, as a driver or crew, you get to pick up where you left off, with customization.\u00a0 Your favorite music, language tapes, even screen savers, are all on tap.\u00a0 A lot of trucks work the same way.\n\nSometimes we'll be using bizmos to transport drivers from one route to another.\u00a0 You've finished your segment from that Chinese city to Pakistan.\u00a0 Now we'll let your relax and talk with others while we take you to a next assignment.\u00a0 Yes, like a taxi, but sometimes we need more bells and whistles.\n\nAs a bizmo fleet training supervisor, I might help orient new crews to their vehicles, in the process of sketching the program.\u00a0 We could train up and down I-5, or I-95, before sending more seasoned crews to more challenging assignments in Asia or Africa.\u00a0 Likewise, we're receiving drivers from those faraway locations and want to show them the lay of the land.\n\nOrientation is the name of the game in a lot of contexts.\u00a0 Do that right, and you have happy campers, up to the challenge.\u00a0 Skip that step, or do it incorrectly, and you're inviting a lot of frustration, on the part of the insufficiently oriented.\n\nI've enjoyed committing to the \"boot track\" for this program i.e. crafting some blueprints.\n\n[T4P == Truckers for Peace](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/05/truckers-for-peace.html).\u00a0 You can read more about that in my blogs and on Medium.\u00a0 Or visit a truck stop near you.\u00a0 Look for us.",
