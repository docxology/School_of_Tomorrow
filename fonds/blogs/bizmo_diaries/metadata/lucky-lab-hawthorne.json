That building is gone now too, is my understanding.\u00a0 However those seeking asylum still remain.\n\nI was back to working with Iranian polytechnic academies on Facebook again. We go from tiling (of a plane) to space-filling (of volume) and best Harvard (except for Dr. Loeb) in going with the A & B modules, with lots of links to the relevant literature (Aristotle etc.).\u00a0 Iranians appreciate [American Transcendentalism](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/10/ethnic-schools.html) by and large. They're reminded of Sufis and not all Sufis are terrorists, despite Turkish PR these days.\n\nCloser to home, I've been finishing up Winter Term with the Catholic flagship archdiocese school in Lake Oswego, and Bridgeport Elementary, more likely to have families needing Food Bank assistance.\n\nI'm closer to Bridgeport in my socio-economic status, having assiduously avoided the outward weapons trade. As a Quaker, I'd have to shoot myself before buying shares in Lockheed, or put another way, owning any shares in Lockheed would be political suicide for an authentic Quaker like me. Or in Raytheon. Or in Halliburton. We have our standards, our code of conduct.\n\nI've steered clear of Alphabet and Apple too (in terms of shareholding, not products or services), as not transparent enough about their back room dealings. I want nothing to do with Beltway Bandits, the scourge of Planet Earth, even if that means eating out of a dumpster (Food Not Bombs rarely resorts to that around here, and if it does, it's with good cause).\n\nAlthough my Codesters applications cover prime numbers and closest packing of spheres, those are maybe not 2nd to 5th grade topics in these parts. I was more previewing what we're learning in Russia and Iran.\u00a0 MIT Scratch is a brilliant platform.\u00a0 Codesters, a partial implementation of Python 3, is more austere, and a bridge to life on Cloud9 ([c9.io](http://c9.io/)) in our curriculum.\u00a0 That's when the JavaScript comes in, using [Codepen](http://codepen.io/).\n\nI had a diagram on the whiteboard in both schools for the parents / guardians, explaining the progression.\u00a0 Kids were feeling somewhat guilty playing games, but I encouraged it, as what better way to harvest ideas and develop motor skills than by game-playing.\u00a0 The two diving boards, low and high, give them opportunities to risk their egos, and make a splash.\u00a0 Some of them did that today, with parents watching.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/32772270884/in/dateposted-public/)",
