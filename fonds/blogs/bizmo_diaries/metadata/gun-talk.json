The guns don't just disappear.\u00a0 Quakers are against outward violence i.e. knives and maces, bombs and catapults, bows and arrows, all fall into the same category as guns, when used as anti-student / anti-faculty devices.\n\nHowever, these same tools may have other uses, obvious in the case of dynamite and cutlery, the sports of archery and target practice. The devices themselves are less relevant than the mindset with which they're taken up.\u00a0 What's the psychology? Are we hunting humans again?\n\nGeorge Fox talked more about swords as carrying firearms in his day and age was not as customary.\u00a0 \"Wear it as long as thou canst\" is how it comes down to us, in archaic language.\u00a0 He was betting that those convinced of Quakerism would eventually likely cease wearing weapons as a part of their costume. They would become persuaded that the real battles were more hidden (in the sense of occult), more invisible.\u00a0 Outward weapons are of limited utility when what needs to be countered is more intelligent, a programmed pattern, a meme virus of some kind.\n\nWhen President Eisenhower warned Americans about the MIC (military-industrial complex), a rather egghead thing to do (but generals are eggheads by and large, and presidents always), he was talking about a form of bureaucratic legalese, laced with whatever values.\u00a0 Bucky came along and called it LAWCAP, which morphed into Grunch in his writings.\u00a0 Everyone matures and distills their own lingo, paradoxically expressing meanings more clearly when idiosyncratic. Bucky's language is nothing if not idiosyncratic even while treating of the \"generalized principles\".\n\nThe MIC is a \"complex\" in the sense a psychology or mindset is a complex.\u00a0 We can call it groupthink, i.e. these complexes are not confined to the brains of single individuals.\u00a0 Which is why guns are ineffective in countering complexes.\u00a0\n\nShooting the patient, the one with symptoms, only feeds the paranoia of those targeted, which stimulates genetic searches for antidotes, ways of coping.\u00a0 A system under attack learns to defend.\u00a0 Telling all the gun owners that Big Brother has plans to take all their guns away, is a way of scaring up a reaction, such as more funding for the NRA.\n\nI prefer a more anthropological approach.\u00a0 How do guns play a role in coming of age narratives, and in rites of initiation?\u00a0 How does one ascend the hierarchy in some gang, company, or priesthood?\n\nI'm suggesting that Quakers tend to get snobby, thinking those resorting to outward war have yet to grapple with root causes.\u00a0 But rampant malign neglect of one's duty, to deep think instead of group think, may result in atrophy within an intelligence community overall.\u00a0 Lights grow dim at 1501 Cherry Street (Philadelphia), if / when the AFSC stops analyzing the MIC.",
