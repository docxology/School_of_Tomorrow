  "content": "This PBS documentary follows the lives of crew members aboard some USS something or other (one that has planes).As a Quaker, it's hard to be fair to these losers and their profligate lifestyle, so not American in any way I treasure (except the good friendships part).  So I won't even try.Competently shot, a good recruiting tool if you're into being a LAWCAP missionary (FYI, LAWCAP is some like old dead computer language some people still use, like COBOL).I'm letting Tara watch as much of it as she likes however, walking through with coffee now and then.  \"Are they still on the boat?\" I ask.  \"Of course they're still on the boat\" she replies.  I was thinking maybe it's [like Lost](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/cultural-anthropology.html), where they finally get off the island.",
