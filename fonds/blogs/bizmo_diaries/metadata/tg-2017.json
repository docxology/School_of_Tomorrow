Tara used to babysit for their kids.\u00a0 Patrick and I were co-workers with O'Reilly School.\n\nNow I'm back in my personal workspace (PWS) plowing through some [instruction videos](https://youtu.be/5ThZst_U4HA).\u00a0 I did about two hours researching wars in the former Yugoslavia first.\u00a0 That came up during dinner, as the war crimes trials in The Hague are just coming to a conclusion around now.\n\nI'm thinking my next Python course should [look at Bitcoin more](https://youtu.be/SMEOKDVXlUo), as an example of (a) applied cryptography and (b) using a complex API.\u00a0 If you've followed me on math-teach at all, I've been pushed for more crypto along [a high school DM (digital math) track](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=10283328).\n\nThe Bartons have a new adult dog named Quinn.\u00a0 I've been getting time with Quinn when Patrick brings him to Mt. Tabor, a popular walk for a lot of us.\n\nTomorrow I'm up early, for travel out of state.\n\nI didn't know that bokeh in photography meant peripheral blur, i.e. there's a contrasting focus on \"what's relevant\".\u00a0 That gets me thinking of the Synergetics \"sphere of relevance\" meme, a system attuned to a frequency that dismisses a bokeh of twilight zone data.\n\nSystems, in Synergetics, have a visual representation as spherical objects.\u00a0 If you read [Peter Sloterdijk's stuff](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/bubbles), you'll get a workout thinking with this metaphor.\u00a0 That could help make Synergetics useful, as a tool.",
