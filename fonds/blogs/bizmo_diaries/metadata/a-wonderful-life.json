  "content": "I found this to be a really fine documentary.  Haven't I seen it before?  Some scenes seem quite familiar, and yet as a whole, I didn't recognize it.\n\nOver on Facebook, I'm taking this opportunity to meditate on my own mortality.\u00a0 I'm but a year younger than when Wittgenstein passed, plus I've been watching lots about Walt Disney and Jim Henson, both of whom went rather suddenly.\n\nThey say our culture is in denial about death, doesn't handle it well.\u00a0 That's a cliche in a way.\u00a0 Why not turn the Halloween season into a time for embracing mortality.\u00a0 To say it \"sugar coats\" death is an obvious truism.\u00a0 What better excuse then, to add a dimension?\n\nRegarding Wittgenstein's biography (above), I'm sure it seems dreary to many, given is ongoing depression, loneliness and suicidal proclivities.\u00a0 On the other hand, he lived through two world wars. The world itself was objectively a dreary one.\u00a0 He worked hard to make a serious contribution.\n\nHis story has finally come together in my mind.\u00a0 The fact that he became a recluse in Norway before the outbreak of WW1, is a detail I've always needed to pin down.\n\nI've gone back to my Princeton days in some ways, when I focused on his later philosophy and wrote a senior thesis about it.\u00a0 I dashed out a kind of [recapitulation of my thinking](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/on-wittgensteins-later-philosophy-1503dd3355ea) on Medium this afternoon.",
