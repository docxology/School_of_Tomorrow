  "content": "I think we've all been impressed by the theme park ride, if we've had the pleasure.\u00a0 I'm talking less about the rollercoasters than what I called \"noisy doors\" in remote childhood.\u00a0 The car rides on a track, with passengers not responsible for steering.\u00a0 Sometimes the track veers unexpectedly, part of the fun, and a reminder of helplessness (these rides can be scary).\n\nWe understand that a swarm of vehicles, controlled by the same software, could fly down the freeway, not touching.\u00a0 A small town might implement the \"Disney\" system.\u00a0 I think of it that way because of the rides, the Wild Ride of Mr. Toad in particular.\n\nSo where are [the EPCOTs](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/driverless-cars-fa2672d7da3b) for testing these technologies?\u00a0 We see the Hyperloop experiments.\u00a0 Prototypes are important, nor must they stay under wraps.\u00a0 We're doing science here.\u00a0 Science evolves through \"many eyeballs\".\u00a0 We're a Bazaar, not a Cathedral.\n\nFrom Al Gore to Donald Trump, the rhetoric has been similar:\u00a0 infrastructure needs upgrades.\u00a0 With president Obama, we got the surge, the economic stimulus package, a shot in the arm.\u00a0 But the public sector is locked out.\u00a0 Investors want to keep it all proprietary.\n\nThe Grunch, in the meantime (a word we use, for \"supranationals as a group\"), needs human subjects. I know that sounds evil.\u00a0 Now I'm thinking of Guinea Pig B, another insider reference.\n\nBernie Sanders:\u00a0 give everyone a job.\u00a0 Reality TV might have a more serious purpose, to show life in an EPCOT.\u00a0 Let people decide for themselves if this is a future to favor.\u00a0 [Product placement](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/05/new-world-order.html) might happen even sans commercials.\u00a0 We see the artifacts in action.\u00a0 We talk about the brands we use.",
