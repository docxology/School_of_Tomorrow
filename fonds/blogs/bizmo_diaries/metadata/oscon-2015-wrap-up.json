  "content": "Buying the keynotes and talks as a post production recording actually costs money, as a way to recoup, so if you find a vintage year (they're all vintage) for cheap, say at Good Will, you'll know it's a good buy.\u00a0 We also stream live, so if you time your life to watch the keynotes, they're available for a window.\u00a0 OSCONs provide telling snapshots of the swiftly evolving IT world from year to year.\n\nNow I'm back in a second floor ballroom, Oregon Convention Center.\u00a0 TriMet is doing maintenance today, on the Max track itself by the look of it.\u00a0 I came on the Hawthorne bus (14) through downtown and switched to Max, getting as far as just over the Steel Bridge, Memorial Colosseum area.\u00a0 The walk from there is quite short, plus shuttle buses were provided (I walked).\n\nSo did you see George Dyson, historian, talking about Imitation Game?\u00a0 He wanted to remind us that Turing was very much a team player and quite popular with his group, not uncomfortable around women or socially awkward in the ways depicted.\u00a0 In other words, he was not the endearing dweeb played by a good actor, a character more of the movie-makers' invention.\u00a0 The movie never claimed to be a documentary right?\u00a0 People need to be reminded about genre.\n\nThe Uber geek, Raffi Krikorian, a polished speaker, wanted us to understand how \"choosing your team\" is \"choosing your architecture\" in large degree, if only implicitly.\u00a0 Engineers use the tools they know best.\u00a0 So build eclectic full stack teams, and keep them smaller (two pizza rule) rather then letting them grow out of control.\n\nThat's the way to manage teams: around micro-services, the wave of the present-future, now that so-called monoliths have been tried and understood.\u00a0 That's not to say \"no more monoliths\" only that if others want to use your monolith, they'll probably want it containerized within the cloud.\n\nAs any geek will tell ya, the philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well is baked into GNU and before that Unix, so micro-services is less a new dogma than data centers hitting their groove, finding a scale at which the concepts apply.\n\n\"Interoperability\" will keep coming back as a buzzword.\n\nFinally, for a last keynote of the morning session, we enjoyed a retrospective of milestones passed, by a precocious thirteen year old girl from LA.\u00a0 She gave us the benefit of some wisdom, about not judging a container by its color, as well as a peak into her busy inner life.\u00a0 She'll have a resume to die for at this rate... already does.\n\nI've come to a final talk entitled:\u00a0 A centralized team in a decentralized world:\u00a0 Engineering tools at Netflix by Mike McGarr (@SonOfGarr).\u00a0 He presents clearly and memorably.\u00a0 Recommended (if you find OSCON 2015 for sale some place).\n\nJust like an airplane experiences thrust versus drag, lift versus weight, engineering tools give us\u00a0 innovation versus change, customers (like lift), the need for support (weight).\n\nCustomers, in this scenario, are Netflix engineers.\u00a0 [Netflix sits on Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix/) a lot, Asgard being one of the open source tools it supports, watch for Spinnaker.\n\nNetflix has its own culture (Freedom & Responsibility):\u00a0 senior engineers, high trust, context not control.\u00a0 Somewhat like doctors in a practice I imagine.\u00a0 Highly aligned to business goals, yet loosely coupled, the teams get behind microservices just like that Uber guy said.\u00a0 This leads to strong subcultures within the organization, reflected in hiring.\n\nEchoing Amber, software engineers need to give undivided attention to coding on occasion.\u00a0 That means rotation in setting a watchman.\u00a0 Let someone monitor feedback letting the others bliss out.\u00a0 Not having a ticketing system was a weakness.\u00a0 My workplace uses JIRA.\n\nAll this thinking aobut Netflix gets me thinking about \"hypertoons\" again, polyhedrons of scenarios (as edges) with switch points (nodes).\u00a0 The nodes are smooth segues and switch points.\u00a0 Player heads navigate the hypertoon, feeding [the reveries on CSN LCDs](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2010/04/smart-bar-lcds.html), and elsewhere.",
