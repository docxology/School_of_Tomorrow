You'll find others of hers scattered through my journals.\u00a0I've watched her editing skills evolve, in tandem with her many adventures.\n\nMy comment on this one (I don't usually comment):\u00a0@kirbyurner\n53 minutes ago\u00a0I\u2019ve watched a lot of Lex interviews over the years. I know this one was a major achievement for him. Congrats Lex. Some DC think tanks have for many decades promoted Ukraine-involving designs to challenge Russian influence in the region. British too. I don\u2019t believe Putin could have prompted this war simply as a self-serving popularity stunt. He needed to tap into the deeply engrained paranoia of the populace. His opponents made that easy. There\u2019s lots of momentum behind these unfortunate developments going back to WW2.",
