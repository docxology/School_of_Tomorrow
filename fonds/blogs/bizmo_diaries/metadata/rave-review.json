She's doing a  great job.\" [[story](http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN2237241120080423)]Yeah, we don't get it about the low ratings [out here](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/02/neighborhood-meetings.html) either, except to say some Americans like to be pandered to, like to see key players bend to mob rule, get in line with the program, whatever that means.The CBS News team has the best access and best stories, we'd be completely at sea without 'em (in some perfect storm if [Fox](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/note-to-journalist.html) had its way, very good for ratings -- if you still have electricity).Sitting around Pauling House table today, speaking freely about whatever.
