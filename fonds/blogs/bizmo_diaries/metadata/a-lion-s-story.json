  "content": "I received a link to this Youtube from a Jewish philosopher friend, like a rabbi (a teacher).\n\nI'm seeing its relevance to my own work within Wanderers to fight any lingering bigotry by the two-leggeds against the [four-leggeds](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/11/chance-of-rain.html) (or against the [no-leggeds](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/04/knotted-snake.html) in the case of Naga & Co.).\n\nAbandoning bigotry is not the same as stopping the practice of carnivorism, although these remain closely related concepts.\n\nSo do Wanderers eat other Wanderers?  -- something to take up in future meetings.",
