  "content": "I understand how casinos themselves might like to have some control over the machines I've been talking about.\u00a0 [Over on CSN](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2019/03/csn-explained.html), the discussion has turned more to hardware, the actual arcade or casino style gambling machine, modified to pump crypto to charities.\u00a0 Church bingo.\n\nRetrofitting an old arcade game with the necessary internals is easier than getting a casino classic, most likely, though ironically.\u00a0 The machinery of payout has been simplified, even in the classic setting.\u00a0 Here, payout is to those fintech thermometers, or to this or that QR code.\u00a0 You may actually \"shoot money\" out of a gun in some games, giving health and happiness to your cute and cuddly targets.\n\nYes, I'm talking about old junk and garage based experiments in some cases.\u00a0 You need your own internal crypto to play with, the money of the house, the currency by which parents pay their kids sometimes, redeemable through the parental bank and/or catalog.\u00a0 Do the dishes and you're credited with this or that cartoon.\u00a0 Smart houses already include these, don't they?\u00a0 Hey, Alexa!\n\nPlay pinball, get to a level, and your winnings start meaning real money from the coffers of Big Company, with its Good Will line item.\u00a0 The circuit diagrams make sense to electronics engineers, who understand about amplification already.\u00a0\n\nIf you've designed the games to be fine tunable, then you'll be able to excite performance as a way of valving \"ions\" (charged particles) to charity, leading to repeat business and reputation building.\n\nI think of a cryptocurrency as \"ions\" (includes \"anions\") meaning particles with the ability to do work.\u00a0 That's just a shorthand for \"battery\" i.e. a source of power or revenue on the chip.\u00a0\n\nIf you want your CPU to do its teraflops, you need to feed it, power the motherboard.\u00a0 We seem a lot\u00a0 less clear about people, whether to power them, despite their evident godliness (NIH -- not invented here).\u00a0 We're suspicious.\u00a0 Indeed, a lot of companies sell the implements of people slaughter (like Home Depot but focused on mayhem and demolition).\n\nThe CSN nodes are not about recruiting vast numbers into the people slaughter business, lucrative though that may be.\u00a0 We have our standards.\u00a0\n\nThat being said, causes you'd willingly fund may also be causes you'd support by other means as well, such as by traveling to a work/study site.\n\nObviously the authorities don't want crypto to fund armed and dangerous organizations, which is why I'm leveraging my Quaker background to get out ahead with a brand that's clearly not about weapons trafficking.\u00a0\n\nI'm not advertising a lot of other prohibitions though.\u00a0 There's no ban in principle on serving boozes, such as rums.\u00a0 Whiskeys.\u00a0 In some regions, I understand local laws prevent such sales, however I'm just making it clear where the restrictions are coming from (i.e. not me).\u00a0 The Nodes (\"shops\" in shoptalk) need morphological capabilities, and biodiversity.\n\nSpeaking of guns (implicitly -- we were talking about weapons), the North Americans treasure their privacy and private property rights as much as their right to bear arms in public places.\u00a0 But what about on private property, if the owner has rights?\u00a0 Can't Farmer Jones, a Quaker, keep all guns off his property?\u00a0 The litigation piles up.\n\nThe etiquette of the West was to respect the wishes of a church, such that gun nuts would leave their pieces in the carriage, with the driver.\u00a0 Naturally that's an invitation to cowards in search of unarmed victims, and some churches might post armed sentries at the door, assuming local police respect the practice.\u00a0 Hotels.\u00a0 Theaters.\u00a0 Zoos.\u00a0 Theme parks.\u00a0 Not all of these belong to the government.\n\nAm I saying Nodes will be \"invitation only\" and more like speakeasies?\u00a0 Am I suggesting airport style screenings to get in?\u00a0 No, not in general.\u00a0 Those would be special case.\u00a0 Think of night clubs you already know.\u00a0 I'm not reinventing every wheel here.\u00a0\n\nRemember the prototyping chapter.\u00a0 You don't want the general public working your machines until you've had a chance to work out the kinks.\u00a0 Every industry has its skunk works, its test pilots.",
