  "content": "I missed Glenn's presentation at Wanderers, owing to the serious leak in my upstairs bathroom, and my needing to work with [Mick the plumber](http://www.micksplumbing.com/). \u00a0I was pleased to learn that Nirel had contributed her professional services and recorded the proceedings. I'm hoping to catch it on Youtube one day soon.\n\nFor you Lindsey fans out there who check these blogs mainly to find out about her, I am pleased to report she's blissing out with her drum machine. \n\nSome complain drum machines [are soulless](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/01/new-years-day.html), but that might be said about any instrument. \u00a0She's made check lists of all the features and made sure to use each one. She has researched the lore connected with this model, including about the machines emulated within. \u00a0Her research helped me decipher the reference to \"808\" in that [Boom Boom Pow number](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/04/cywar-in-cyberia.html). \u00a0The 808 was a drum machine. \n\nHer nickname for [this machine](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3949999261/) is R2 (as in R2D2) and she loves it dearly. \u00a0Her process is to create drum tracks for three entire albums before going back to add keyboard and vocal tracks. \u00a0This is what's going on in my basement, amidst the occasional flooding or rat visitation.\n\nThis is my first posting from the new work computer, a Macbook Air, pretty sleek. \u00a0I don't have the reflexes for this machine yet, POSIX-based though it may be. \u00a0I'm liking it though, and plan to be a quick study.\n\nI've got a couple vids from\u00a0Movie Madness\u00a0to take in, one on Fidel, the other on birds. \u00a0More details later.\n\nProving I'm a USA citizen is the new language game. \u00a0I've got another I-9 to do, but in setting aside my expired passport and SSN, I think I might have pushed them off the radar. \u00a0The current plan is to show up at the Social Security office downtown on Monday with my driver's license. \u00a0It looks that that might work, in which case I can meet the deadline and FedEx the forms, per Kathleen's request.\n\nLindsey is a huge popcorn fan, with or without the videos / movies. \u00a0She jumped into this pose as a statement of her approval, half in spoof of herself for so doing. \u00a0That's a 25 pound bag of popcorn on the left, sea salt, and oil. \u00a0The basic ingredients of life.\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6774109409/)\n\nSimon was offering some of his accumulated stuff as giveaways at [Colonel Summers Park](http://www.portlandonline.com/parks/finder/index.cfm?PropertyID=12&action=ViewPark) last night. I grabbed a Make: magazine. He said he once had a whole collection of those. His DIY bike trailer, made from a ladder, with a custom hook, is paradigm DIY in my book. Simon lives the dream, as do many on this FNB circuit.\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6774112983/)\u00a0[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6774112251/)\n\u00a0[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6774113269/)[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6774112473/)",
