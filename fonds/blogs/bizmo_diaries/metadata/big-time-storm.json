  "content": "All is bright and calm in Portland this morning, with garbage and recycling trucks plying their beats. However, [a great storm](http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2012/10/30/at-least-17-dead-millions-without-power-in-sandy-aftermath/) rages in the Atlantic states, from Jersey inland to the Great Lakes. \u00a0This was right before the 2012 presidential election.\n\nMom (Carol) is rocking back and forth in her chair (\"unprecedented\"). \u00a0Her women are eyeing [the nuclear power plants](http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/hurricane-sandy-problems-nuke-plants/story?id=17598503#.UJLVzoUeW2y), full of distrust in the wake of\u00a0Fukushima. \u00a0With all the grid problems to come, how might we conduct free and fair elections? \u00a0An extra joker was slipped into the deck. \u00a0The game of poker is now a game of something else (it's called \"game changing\").\n\nOregon has voting by mail. \u00a0There's a secret ballot envelope that goes inside an outer signed envelope, with the signature acting as a kind of thumb print, a practice in early banking as well, though stationery certainly helps. \n\nI don't know to what extent the ability to \"re-run\" any election is electronically archived. \u00a0Those states with their act really together keep a record of all the ballots (delinked from identity) and are able to re-run the elections at will. \u00a0Universities download and study the data, doing all manner of statistics. \u00a0The data is safely anonymized meaning it's somewhat hard to trace back, but not impossible, especially where write-in candidates (obscure ones) feature.\n\nCarol has her office back together. \u00a0We have CenturyLink wifi through much of the house, with signal tapering quite sharply outside the bubble. \u00a0Since the advent of 3G / 4G, I also have secondary wifi on at least one device and am able to talk to towers (cell towers) in the vicinity. \n\n[That's how tethering sometimes works](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/10/bluetooth-connection.html), when you can't get onto an Internet access point and so avail of your cellular network's tower-based service. \u00a0Hurricanes may damage cell towers. \u00a0This will be one story among many to follow. \u00a0Telecommunications disruption hampers restoring services.\n\nIf there's any good news in this disaster it's the extra cleanup work before Xmas and the additional income this may engender, along with the physical workout (which is easy to overdo -- this is where churches and such need to offer R&R opportunities to the first responders and infrastructure rebuilders, if only bananas and sunglasses (whatever sponsors might spare and pass through that would be appreciated on the front lines)).\n\nTo what extent Food Not Bombs will be assisting with this emergency is hard to gauge from my vantage point ([SE Chapter / PDX](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/10/halloween-2011-2-of-3.html)). \u00a0I know [Keith McHenry himself](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/04/spring-cleaning.html) worked long hours during Katrina to help coordinate among emergency services. \u00a0He stays in communication, is not out there to duck the responsibilities when on duty. \u00a0I haven't seen anything on the list though, which is mostly local traffic. Oh wait, [this just in](http://blog.foodnotbombs.net/you-can-help-food-not-bombs-provide-food-and-logistical-support-for-the-survivors-of-sandy/) (linked from [here](https://lists.riseup.net/www/arc/pdxfnb/2012-10/msg00066.html)).\n\nCoordinating is a skill and well orchestrated emergency efforts make a big difference. \n\nI expect offers of assistance from overseas teams. \u00a0It'd be wise to accept in many cases, would be my leading, even as the rest of the country responds, in part by absorbing refugees. \u00a0Sometimes it's a good time to move, when you've lost everything (or even just worldly goods). \u00a0Many North Americans will be re-assessing their next moves in light of Hurricane Sandy.",
