I'd recently viewed a documentary compilation of Sex Ed films, USA / vintage (lots aimed at military men overseas), he immediately recommended The Girl Next Door as follow-on viewing.\u00a0 He was on target as usual.\n\nIt's a coming of age movie aimed at vintage high schoolers especially, not just males but also females who study them and their competition, with the accepted stereotypes (remote Asian genius; stuffy oldsters who loosen up at the club) already ensconced.\u00a0 Stereotypes are not a \"no no\", they're stock in trade in the movie industry.\u00a0 Just because I run across a stereotype doesn't mean I'll think ill of a film.\u00a0 [Some films](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/12/team-america-world-police-movie-review_04.html) are all stereotypes and cliches.\n\nThe main stereotype this movie wants to explore is that of \"porn star\" and how the porn industry relates to Sex Ed, our could, if we'd let it talk about [LGTHBQQI](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/06/gay-pride.html) (H = hetero) in a classroom \"driver's ed\" style context (but maybe with fewer horror stories?).\n\nThe aforementioned documentary focused on how the Christian Right had used the Reagan years to preach abstinence, as this was the decade of the Church Come Back.\u00a0 Or was it two decades of anti-liberalizing backlash puritanism?\u00a0 Depends whom you ask I suppose.\u00a0 HIV had a lot to do with both the need to be explicit, and to curb certain behaviors.\u00a0 Biology is serious business, regardless of ethnicity.\n\nFor every hundred or so women you'll meet who chafe under patriarchal oppression,\u00a0 you'll find a woman willing to boldly state that her side of the species is running the show.\u00a0 Men are hopelessly outclassed by the fairer sex.\u00a0 Is there a way it truly is, with only 1% getting the right picture?\u00a0 Subjectivity trumps objectivity in this case.\u00a0 The world is how one experiences it, but the higher levels are \"what you're adding\" as est put it; that's your \"value added\" in other words (the post-production cutting room is between your ears).\n\nWe had a guy at Wanderers recently, at a meetup I missed, claiming he'd developed the hypothesis of greater turnover among women i.e. they've been having shorter generations between birth cycles than men.\u00a0 I'm not sure how he works the math, but the upshot is:\u00a0 he thinks women have had that much longer to evolve and are literally a superior species to men, though sharing most chromosomes.\n\nSpeaking of chromosomes, now that DNA testing is not the super expensive undertaking it once was, a lot of data are coming in.\u00a0 Things we thought were true may not be, such as that one's physical gender characteristics are XY- or XX-determined.\u00a0 Nature is offering up more anomalies than the original theory could accommodate.\u00a0 I won't advertise up to date knowledge of intersex phenomena.\u00a0 Lets turn to the [web] [pages of Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/sex-redefined-1.16943).\n\nSpeaking of Glenn S., I heard from Glenn B. recently, another Glenn I know since our senior year together at [International School, Makati](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/06/high-school-memorabilia.html).\u00a0 We compared some notes about an upcoming conference.\u00a0 He sent me [this picture](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/16531564157/) from when I was more like the high schoolers in this film (closer to their age).\u00a0 Now I'm more like the principal, in age if not in demeanor or moral rectitude.\u00a0 Actually the principal comes around in the end:\u00a0 stodgy Sex Ed films don't do nearly the job the porn industry could, perhaps using animation.\n\nI had a prom night and worried about colleges and stuff i.e. it's not like my high school experiences were without overlap with this fictional film.\u00a0 Given I lived in the Philippines, I found my peers especially attractive.\u00a0 My date was a nerd like I was (destined to be a geek) and from a strong Catholic background.\u00a0 We had a lot of \"moral fiber\" back then, though like at any high school, the kids mature at different rates.\u00a0 [Karma](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/04/bumper-sticker.html) is somewhat individualized, for all the stereotypes in play.\n\nMy teachers weren't that stodgy though, nor the principal.\u00a0 As for Sex Ed, I think they left that to R-rated films we'd all see in the malls.\u00a0 Plus there's always the encyclopedia.",
