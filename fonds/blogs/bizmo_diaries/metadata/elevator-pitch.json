  "content": "The elevator pitch for the giant dome is survivalist, which immediately gets funny, because of Yes Men and their Survivaball.\u00a0 Not that domes are the equivalent of space suits.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBut when it comes to heating and cooling a big volume, the logistics of powering a single space comes with an economy of scale, at least in theory.\n\nInside, you have your sound stage and audience,\u00a0 a perimeter of concessions.\u00a0 In neighboring domes, people pitch their tents.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn some, you stage a quaint village, Medievalish but with amenities, built more with movie set theater prop technology, than with old fashioned brick and mortar, as you're more in a studio than protecting against the elements.\u00a0\n\nThe dome or other universal studio building is already taking care of wind, rain, cold and heat.\n\nBenefits of rapidly deployed and emergency assembled and disassembled heating and cooling domes include practicing the world game disciplines we've come to take for granted.\u00a0 People have to choreograph and to some extent improvise.\u00a0 The moves become smooth to the extent practiced.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMovie-making comes closest, as a design science, with military logistics providing a complementary theater.\u00a0 Both center around simulation and planning with models and maps.\n\nThe domes in Cornwall provide a good example of what we all expect from the UK.\u00a0 If British Aerospace can't deploy emergency heating domes, who can?\u00a0 Raytheon?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe engineering sector is shifting our attention from \"Big Tech\" and/or \"Big Pharma\" in the sense of social media and biochemistry advertisers respectively, as these are small fry compared to the aerospace sector.\u00a0 We have conventionally allocated aerospace to civilian versus military but there's little to keep this namespace anchored.\n\nBesides, it's not either / or.\u00a0 Health care is just as big a consumer of computer science warez as the military and weapons vendors.\u00a0 The arrival of mass casualties during wartime, begot triage and triage tents and all manner of medical practice I know more about from watching movies than from nursing school.\u00a0 WW1 saw the beginning of many new kinds of war science.\n\nSpeaking of nursing, I do appreciate the cram course YouTubes I've been plowing through.\u00a0 As we all get older, we encounter more issues in health care, for ourselves and for others.\u00a0 In my case, I also had a professional track running through heart procedure territory, being a chief data harvester for a research hospital system.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI was not in patient care, unless we count long term outcomes research, a kind of feedback doctors treasure.\u00a0 I knew heart anatomy pretty well.\u00a0 Lately I've focused more on lungs and liver.\n\nCould a giant dome be an emergency hospital, like a MASH unit?\u00a0 People may spontaneously associate such setups with war zones, but disaster scenes more generally feature both the wounded and the infected.\u00a0 Lately, the world has been dealing with infection and overdose.\u00a0 That was until they decided to plug and play this retro Euro-war.\u00a0 Now war wounds are what's climbing again, along with thermal issues.\n\nSo we're back to MIT having done its homework, and private firms having their catalog of emergency shelters at the ready, whether or not they'e actually free span.\u00a0 The more likely shape of anything American is a box, with sliding doors, more like a giant garage, farmhouse or big box shopping center store, like a Costco or Home Depot.\n\nThe floor plan of a \"camp in\" dome is more suburban street mode, with curvilinear walkways (synthetic pavements) and marked out camping sites, like when car camping.\u00a0 A few golf cart type vehicles offer fixed route services whereas delivery forklifts carry palettes to and fro, complete with kitchen units and entertainment (education) modules.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSome properties have tents, but a lot of those are outside.\u00a0 Property holders stack the various units, which need not be equipped with individual heating or cooling units, given the context, of a larger system.\u00a0 You may have personal devices, such as fans or baseboard units.\u00a0 There might be a sauna and/or hot tub module, depending on amps available.\n\nThe Cornwall Domes use like a Tefzel pillow, I've never toured the place.\u00a0 J. Baldwin was my source of pillow dome savvy.\u00a0 I got to interview the guy on camera even, when staying with Rick and company in San Jose.\n\nWhat do the power stations look like?\u00a0 That's another whole side of the business.\u00a0 No doubt NATO, like FEMA, has a large number of plans for such units, with other regional bodies likewise sharing blueprints.\u00a0 Given the dire needs of the populace, and funding already allocated, it's time to spring into action, right?\u00a0 Right!",
