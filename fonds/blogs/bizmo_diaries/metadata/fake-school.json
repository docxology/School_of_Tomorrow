They\u2019d lose control.\n\nWhat am I talking about \"They'd find us.\"?\u00a0 Simply that Qanon pumps up Mockingbird as one of their dots to connect, but then fails to connect it.\n\nC'mon kids, don't be as dense as your parents, my contemporaries.\u00a0 Get a clue and study more of your heritage.\u00a0 The Applewhite guy retired and went on to collaborate with his boyhood hero.\u00a0 Who was that again?\n\nC'mon kids, if you're not getting time with the bash shell, ask your doctor if that's good for you.\u00a0 In the Beginning was the Command Line.\u00a0 Read it yet?\u00a0 If you're in high school, has any math teacher mentioned RSA (public key crypto, but also the Republic of South Africa matters too)?\u00a0\u00a0\n\nYes?\u00a0 Congratulations, there's hope for your high school.\n\nSeriously, in this Internet Age, you have Net right there staring you in the face, all day every day. So if your school isn't talking Graph Theory, as in nodes & edges, as in V + F = E + 2, then maybe stop calling it that?\u00a0 Why would you call that \"school\"?\n\nFake school is as real as fake news.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/51685563618/in/dateposted-public/)",
