  "content": "August Sixth has special meaning around here, and for the world, as it marks the first time an atomic weapon was used by humans against themselves, with strong intent. Another detonation would follow, over the city of Nagasaki.\n\nHumans were nuking themselves in various \"tests\" as well, irradiating themselves and their environment. Many thought nuclear war was inevitable, and many still do, so low is the average faith in politicians and the political process.\u00a0 Religion was marginalized earlier.\u00a0 What's left?\u00a0 A sense of self preservation maybe?\n\nPortlanders have typically turned out for a simple ceremony, emphasizing Japanese-American friendship, in a park with that moniker.\u00a0 That ceremony has been suspended this year, has have most formally planned group events for the summer.\n\nWe're hoping that friendship stays strong and remains mutual, much though it may have been tested since that darker age.",
