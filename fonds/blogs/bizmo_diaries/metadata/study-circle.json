How does Synergetics relate to the CCP?\n\nNo mention of Dr. Arthur Loeb, nor A & B modules, T & E modules (3D printable!).\n\nWe'll have exhibits in our World Game Museum, of what the textbooks were ignoring (a basis for ignorance). Lets see how the narrative accounts compute then, shall we?\n\nIs West Point teaching the Bucky stuff at least, sharing our American heritage with high ranking officers?\u00a0 Scandalous if not. We're investigating. \n\nA couple comments, from my Facebook timeline:\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/32824207775/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nAlso:\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/32824208605/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nThe\n main literary trope I find regarding Bucky is that he was a failure and\n his inventions didn't fly. Put his awards and degrees, number of works \npublished, historical role as \"engineer saint\", in a pile, and put that \npile next to any detractor's and compare.\u00a0\n\nTrue, he didn't win a Nobel \nPrize. Is eleven honorary PhDs enough (given for free remember, to help a\n school uphold its own brand)? Elliot Norton chair of poetry at Harvard?\n Patents not just on the dome, but the IVM itself (like if Descartes had\n patented XYZ).\u00a0\n\nThis guy appears to be a huge success, by objective \ncriteria. One of the most successful who ever lived. I think the \"he was\n a failure\" trope is a projection. People think \"the world is still a \nghetto ergo Bucky did not succeed.\" Specious. Completely void of real \nthought.\n\nOr was it 47 PhDs? That's what [BFI claims](https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/biography). Depends what \"doctorate\" means maybe.\u00a0\n\nSuch a failure right? [Poor slob](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/06/poor-slob-bucky-psb.html).\n\nAfter\n being spurned early in his career by the architecture and construction \nestablishments, Fuller was later recognized with many major \narchitectural, scientific, industrial, and design awards, both in the \nUnited States and abroad, and he received 47 honorary doctorate degrees.\n In 1983, shortly before his death, he received the Presidential Medal \nof Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, with a citation \nacknowledging that his \"contributions as a geometrician, educator, and \narchitect-designer are benchmarks of accomplishment in their fields.\" \n\nStudy Circle.
