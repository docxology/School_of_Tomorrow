  "content": "The concept of \"tweening\" comes from ToonTown, the animation industry, to which [Portland plays host](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/12/toontown-revisited.html).\u00a0 Comics too, witness [Dark Horse](https://www.darkhorse.com/).\u00a0 Manga and anime, for those used to a more Japanese spin.\n\nThe \"in between\" frames connect the \"key frames\" -- in hypertoons too.\u00a0 I claim [hypertoons](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/07/hypertoons-etc.html) to be my invention, where scenarios intersect through switch-point nodes.\u00a0 With no break in continuity, your playheads travel through a \"spaghetti ball\" of toons (edges, segments, clips).\n\nWhere physics comes in:\u00a0 are we able to connect key frames A and B with a set number of \"tween\" frames without breaking any physical \"laws\".\u00a0 Physics is under pressure to provide guaranteed, deterministic results, provided one follows instructions.\u00a0 No miracles required.\n\nCalculus is all about expressing rules in terms of neighboring frames.\u00a0 Some scientists flirt with the notion that each frame determines the next in some ironclad fashion, such that all the unfolding action is like clockwork, deterministic, including our own thoughts and feelings.\n\nBelieve it or not, such a notion is actually a comfort to some, as \"it could not have turned out differently\" is a kind of reassurance people sometimes offer.\n\nIn practice, the meaning of \"determined\" breaks down if the trajectory stays unpredictable, even with the benefit of hindsight.\u00a0 \"Given what we know now, we still could not have predicted what would happen, back then\" is not that unusual to hear.\n\nSans any closed form formula letting us crystal ball the future, our only way to find out is to get there.\u00a0 However, statistics still tells us about likelihoods, and that death, if not taxes, is certain.\u00a0 Taxes remain highly probable.\n\nAll questions of determinism aside, marrying the language of animation to scenario planning and calculus is [not a stupid idea](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2018/10/animation-classes.html).\u00a0 We're always making recordings these days, to various media, of what goes on around us.\u00a0 The study of trajectories, of particles in cloud chambers, is at the heart of quantum physics.",
