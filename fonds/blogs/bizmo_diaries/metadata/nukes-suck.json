my long time blog readers know, I don't believe the Persians are hellbent on getting nuclear weapons.\u00a0 On the contrary, the political rhetoric coming from these religious leaders as that holding such WMDs is highly immoral and unethical.\n\nThe US Christians don't usually say that.\u00a0 Evangelicals tend to be pro atom bomb, as an expression of God's love for them.\n\nProtestants are especially bomb crazed and explosive ordnance, along with horror films, are principal exports of those infecting the urban areas, District of Columbia especially.\n\nLoving the bomb is right up there with meth and heroine addiction, or addiction to an especially reprobate form of kinky porn.\u00a0 It's not in the DSM, but it should be, as a possibly treatable mental illness.\n\nA typical symptom of severe mental illness is uncontrolled projection.\u00a0 If you secretly lust after so-and-so, then it may seem everyone around you is driven by similar secrets.\u00a0 The lust for nuclear weapons becomes universal, in the mind of one who's been taken over by the meme virus.\n\nThat's what I see happening vis-a-vis the Persians (I don't say Iran because I'm not a big believer in UK imperial globes and their hastily drawn districts, silly anthems and flags, and nutty alliances between their \"royal\" spoiled families).\u00a0 The nuke heads can't imagine losing the moral high ground, and compensate by playing king of the hill as they wallow in their addiction.\n\nI don't have nuclear weapons, never have.\u00a0 I came to Nuthouse Earth in 1958 and found it to be a place of great potential, but fearful idiot warmongers have been making this place a hell the whole time I've been here.\u00a0 I get it.\u00a0 The species is deeply flawed.\u00a0 Great religions have worked to address these flaws, with some success, but there's a ways to go.\n\nActually, human nature may not be the core problem.\u00a0 Growing pains entail many changes and that's why we need finite life spans, so that humans replace themselves with humans able to come to grips with the new realities, whatever these may be.\u00a0 Even if there's reincarnation, we get to shed a lot of the debilitating beliefs we build up over the course of a lifetime.\u00a0 There's that reset button, for back to factory settings, with true learnings collectively preserved.\n\nIn our time, the UN General Assembly has bypassed the UN Security Council and come up with its own treaty banning nuclear weapons.\u00a0 Of course the nuke heads are against this treaty, but they're dying of aging and making last gasps.\u00a0 The youth are more realistic and understand their careers as weapons inspectors and environmental cleanup agents are beaconing.\u00a0 Dealing with messes the nuke heads made is already full time work for many people.\n\nIran (there, I said it, when in Rome...) has much more to gain than to lose by choosing the moral high ground and helping the world rid itself of weapons of mass suicide.\u00a0 The Iranian religious leaders have embraced the UN Ban Treaty and proposed the whole region be nuclear free.\u00a0 The whole globe, one would hope, would move in that direction, as a matter of religious faith and respect for whatever deity or deities.\n\nGiven the religious nature of Iran's anti-nuke weapon position, discovering a secret program such as others, suffering from their horrendous addiction, have no choice but to imagine, would be especially devastating psychologically.\u00a0 Such hypocrisy would be hard to fathom.\u00a0 That's like when gay bashing pulpit imams are found guilty of gay affairs.\n\nA much more promising approach is for Iran to continue growing its alliances within the anti nuke weapon network, which includes the mayors of most cities.\u00a0 Portland and Tehran are on the same page for example.\u00a0 Oregon likewise suffers under sanctions from the dinosaur Federales and their military junta dictatorship.\u00a0 We're friends with Iran.\n\nWhat we want to stop is all the ethnic warring, deliberately inflamed by so-called special operators who make it their business to sew discord and distribute outward weapons.\u00a0 Some of these operators pretend to be working on behalf of some \"intelligence\" agency but we've exposed that form of corruption many times.\u00a0 Any drug dealer and half-wit criminal can come on TV or Youtube saying they work for the CIA.\u00a0 Some of these people then get paying jobs working in media.\n\nRemember, anyone who says \"our nuclear weapons\" or \"when we bombed Japan\" is likely an arm of some \"we\" that no longer has integrity or legitimacy.\u00a0 These people need treatment, medical care, and are not ready for responsible offices or important duties.\n\nLastly, I don't want to promote ageism by saying older people can't continue to upgrade their thinking.\u00a0 That's what American Transcendentalism is all about, what with its mind / brain distinction and focus on divine grace (intuition, Holy Spirit, zeitgeist).\n\nYour heritage as a human is to have access to continuing revelation.\u00a0 So if you're already older than thirty, hang in there and remember to pray for wisdom.\u00a0 Don't end up like the walking dead.\u00a0 Become reborn, over and over.",
