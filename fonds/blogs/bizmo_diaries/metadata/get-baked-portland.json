I remember when [Mary Bolton](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/11/celebrating-mary-bolton.html) was so disheartened when signing her check Mary Butter at the checkout lane, when buying some.\u00a0 Hey, we all make mistakes.\n\nStill, I was worried when Deke the Geek kept telling me about this Bizmo in the middle of our local supermarket, and I kept going there, in a trance no doubt, and not seeing it.\n\nSo today I made a special point of looking it up.\u00a0 Franz was important in my childhood, before I left for Italy.\u00a0 Our Markham elementary school, it had to have been, did a field trip.\u00a0 A real bread factory.\u00a0 Impressive.\n\nI've always enjoyed seeing things being made.\u00a0 Kim Jong Un must really enjoy [all those tours](https://youtu.be/UpddVkJ7M7U) he gets, of factories, as a part of his job.\n\nI went on some tours of Chinese factories in the 1970s, during the Four Modernizations.\u00a0 We were looked up to, as a tour group, as a possible source of ideas.\u00a0 Mostly high school teachers, from the bases, with me and Glenn Baker tagging along as diplomatic corps (expat brats).\n\nI bought a loaf on the spot, in recognition of the company's acumen as much as anything.\u00a0 Of course it's a hippie bus.\u00a0 No reason to go overboard and go all Vortex.\u00a0 Grateful Dead bread sells itself.\n\nMeanwhile, back at Starbucks, Deke the Geek was catching up on Adweek.  We did a mini-photo-shoot right there and then.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/31322832073/in/dateposted-public/)",
