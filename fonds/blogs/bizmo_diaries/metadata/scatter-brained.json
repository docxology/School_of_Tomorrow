  "content": "I've been disciplining myself to keep track of my toys in conjunction with this leather satchel I carry around, but that discipline broke down yesterday apparently.\n\nThe new Nikon Coolpix has been a joy, purchased [in March](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/03/music-as-water.html) of last year.\u00a0 The last picture I took with it:\u00a0 Sick Jokes (a collection) and my quad shot latte, at Fresh Pot adjacent [Powell's on Hawthorne](http://www.powells.com/locations/powells-books-on-hawthorne/).\u00a0 Presumably I threw it back in the satchel at that point.\n\nHowever there's no indication (so far) the camera ever made it home, although that's where I went next.\u00a0 Maybe it'll turn up.\u00a0 Probably it went to the same Negative Universe as my [Paul Kaufman hat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/2925326629/).\u00a0 I find it disturbing when I can't put my finger on just when and where the sleight of hand occurred, me that dupe of my own legerdemain.\n\nI still have the Olympus Stylus as a fall back.\u00a0 Those 14x zoom shots and richer colors will be absent from the Photostream for awhile, looks like.\n\nActually, I'm so attached to this camera that, finding it on sale for only $207, I grabbed another (free shipping).\u00a0 If I find the other one I'll make it, or the new one, a gift to someone.\n\nI learned from Math Forum that Dr. William Thurston has died at age 65.\u00a0 He was one of my professors at Princeton, for honors calculus.",
