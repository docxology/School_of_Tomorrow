  "content": "[ from TrimTab Book Club listserv ]\nWe've had Model United Nations for some time now.\u00a0 High schoolers join as an extracurricular activity.\u00a0 When I joined my daughter's debate team going to Indianapolis for national championships, I learned about another activity high schoolers could sign up for:\u00a0 Model NATO.Would we consider these to be implementations of World Game?\u00a0 Not in any trademarked sense.\u00a0 Will World Game, as developed so far, be able to give rise to multiple implementations, all different from one another?\u00a0 We shall see.\u00a0 In the open source world, it's quite common to fork a project and develop along a new branch.As I mentioned earlier, I know at least one guy (related to Bucky himself he claimed -- different last name though) who was very put off by the fact that an earlier World Game version had it scripted right into the program, that no matter what participants did, those poker chips would come out andspill across that map, representing nuclear holocaust.\u00a0 That was supposed to be a sobering moment.\u00a0 But it could just as well be interpreted as a teaching about the ultimate fruitlessness of any efforts to avoid Armageddon.I'd at least be up for debating that point.\u00a0 I don't take it for granted that this earlier design was a work of inspired genius. Bucky didn't go the poker chip route did he?\u00a0 That came after he died on the timeline, am I right?True, I'd like to see versions of World Game that aren't so ultimately predictable.\u00a0 Given I think this is all world game right now, one can see why.",
