On the other hand, it was maybe worth a try.I like to think of Keiko is an [honorary Wanderer](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/recruiting-new-wanderer.html), the protagonist of a long, strange trip under the auspices of many adoring fans, many of whom got to see him up close and personal (me included).Related reading:  #1944 [wwwanderers eGroup](http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wwwanderers/).",
