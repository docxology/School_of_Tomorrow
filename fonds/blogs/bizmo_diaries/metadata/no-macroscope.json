If there's a way to save more animals, consider the options.\u00a0 I digress.\n\nI never supported their use in warfare, though of course war is not about \"fair\" and no one asked my permission, one way or the other. I never called for their use against Julian either, even in jest.\n\nBuckminster Fuller suggested \"geoscope\" for the same thing, and got close in 1967, when the original US State Department proposal was for an unfolding geoscope that formed a Dymaxion Projection (same Gaussian as a Snyder pretty much but in a unique arrangement ideally suited to keeping contiguous landmasses contiguous).\n\nThose adjoined only by oceans get spread apart.\n\nThe Expo people decided that might be too cerebral and why not go with a giant geodesic dome instead, a smaller version memorialized at EPCOT in Orlando, decades latter?\n\nMontreal 67 was the Taj Mahal of geodesic structures.\u00a0 No nation has had more self respect than Canada, when it comes to hosting such a bold architecture.\u00a0 Makes sense:\u00a0 Donald Coxeter.\n\nLater blueprints anchored a Geoscope in East River opposite the UN building, a convenience for those inside, and a tourist attraction.\u00a0 The tensegrity moorings would have competed for attention with the tensegrity radio tower atop New York's newest trade center, had either project been completed.\n\nKenneth Snelson of Needle Tower fame (Washington DC) and many other tensegrity structures, had been approached about providing one as a finishing touch to the new skyscraper.\n\nActually, macroscopes do exist, for precisely the purpose intended, the display of global data.\u00a0 They just don't enjoy the courtesy of an instrument name, such as \"telescope\" and \"microscope\" enjoy.\u00a0 We're to get by with \"globe\" or \"planetary data display\" or some generic.\n\nThat's as of 2018 BCE in my specific locale (OR 97214), where I monitor only a subsample of how the world population speaks (by \"world population\" I mean to include those in low orbit aboard staffed machines).\n\nGlenn Stockton of Global Matrix fame keeps tabs on such literature and is well aware of the many authors and authorities involved in macroscope development.\u00a0 Again, Google Earth is representative of the state of the art.\n\nBut in what ways has this asset been incorporated into the elementary, middle and high school grades?\u00a0 The vector towards becoming a \"household word\" is through percolation within a curriculum.\u00a0 Who looks at Earth?\n\nMore schools may be screening macroscopes soon.\u00a0 The LCDs might not be interactive, but are instead preprogrammed to hop around, like a programmed Planetarium projector might do.\n\nThese are related devices (Planetariums and Macroscopes), as Christian Science Mapparium (Boston, MA) clearly demonstrates.\u00a0 Observers stand inside the planet in question, with global data appearing as stained glass. Might pixels be referred to as \"stained\" when containing RGB \"dyes\"?\n\nLook for macroscopes in Dubai?\n\nThe Lower48 keeps telling itself it's the richest \"nation\" on Earth -- which is touching -- and we want these folks to succeed.\u00a0 But lets be honest:\u00a0 their budget for education is far outclassed by those working harder for their children.\u00a0 End Timers have reason to be lazy, in proportion to the certainty with which they cling to those beliefs.\n\nI'm not claiming all North Americans are End Timers, let alone all in Lower48.\u00a0 But those who are ready to see it all come to a full stop probably won't see the need for planners or futurists.\u00a0 What's the point, right?",
