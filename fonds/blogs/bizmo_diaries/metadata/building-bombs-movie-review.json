  "content": "A chronicle / documentary regarding the ongoing criminal activities of various rogue elements, way worse than meth labs in many dimensions. \n\nGiving the DEA jurisdiction over the DOE's traffic in uber-toxins might make some sense, but the EPA and FDA are currently responsible.\u00a0 They're doing next to nothing though.\u00a0 DC does not actually contribute much to the management of North America, one comes to find out pretty quickly.\n\nBureaucrats tend to be more part of the problem than a part of the solution, given their conditioned-reflexes are so entirely obsolete.\n\nUniversities have an opportunity here as many idealistic young are eager to be involved in monitoring and cleanup.\u00a0 That's to be a major focus of engineering from here on.\n\nOutsourcing bottom-wiping might be what Americans need to do though.\u00a0 They're being starved for relevant training, yet being charged high tuition.\u00a0 Eloi.\u00a0 Defenseless.\n\nI hope Iranians appreciate the lessons of this (rather old by now) film.\u00a0 Don't follow the Americans down that path.\u00a0 They made a wrong turn awhile back and have lost their way.\u00a0 Help lead the world in a more positive direction.",
