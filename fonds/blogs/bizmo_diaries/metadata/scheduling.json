  "content": "At first I imagined turning off the music and heading up to the office, because prompted by an idea. Then I thought: \"nah, lets queue it\". This is a core movement in consciousness: to put off, to delay.\u00a0\n\nWe get mixed messages at this point, as \"procrastination\" is considered a primary obstacle to success in life. On the other hand, \"think before you act\" reminds us of the common criticism regarding a failure to plan, to think it through, to accurately judge consequences, before acting.\n\nOne has to think of circumstances. Chances are, when you have a great idea for something, you have to add it to the queue or stack, because right now you're on the bus or mowing the lawn or... a lifestyle based on \"drop everything; I just thought of doing something else\" would be interesting to study, from afar. Most of us learn to \"delay gratification\" except it's not always \"gratification\" we put off.\n\nThe brutal truth is there's no time or space for everything to develop in tandem or all at once. Events need to be queued, sequenced, timelined. That's not really a choice. Why does the hourglass narrow? What does \"to bottleneck\" mean?\u00a0\n\nSo here I am, later, implementing my earlier idea: to write about scheduling again.\u00a0\n\nWe introduce the theory, as from computer science, and the reality, as from getting out of bed in the morning, and combine them in a seamless picture of needing to treat the present like a narrow pipeline, which it is, when we're talking of an individual consciousness.",
