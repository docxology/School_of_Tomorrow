Maybe you are. My sister works there. I\u2019m basing my brand of science fiction in the real world, per usual.\n\nPeople know I\u2019m of the mixed use office tower school of thought, promoting gamer pods in place of cubicles on some floors, with dorms, not necessarily apartments, on other floors.\n\nWhat distinguishes a dorm from an apartment? \u00a0\n\nA dorm is more like a hotel room in having a microwave and a few supplies, but the cafeterias are elsewhere in the building. Kitchens may be supplied at the floor level, with floors organizing group meals, per the curriculum we\u2019re developing.\u00a0\n\nYou may have seen about my Food Not Bombs background, and Gathering of Western Young Friends before that.\n\nI think of my sister\u2019s school because of her work in an educational supplies store, which in turn has me thinking of Math \u2018n Stuff, Northgate, Seattle. A specialty curriculum store stocks the kinds of toys and kits I\u2019ve been curating a few samples of, such as the Mites Cube, Zome, Lux, Tensegritoy, other Design Science Toys products.\n\nDST is defunct, but the ideas, and its collected products, live on. \u00a0Full disclosure: I worked with DST on Strange Attractors, the toy that was going to save the bacon. Yes, a real Toy Story.\n\nThe point of field testing new products, in the context of new lesson plans, is to get it down to a replicable format and segments, easily transmitted to other classrooms. We have the Lux Blox example. I\u2019ve been tracking Accera and testing his company\u2019s product, in the context of Martian Math. However my gigs have been infrequent, unable to keep up through the iterations.\u00a0\n\nC6XTY sits idle, much of it in landfills by now. As a one many show, I\u2019m able to juggle only so many balls. Sam keeps a small exhibit space at the farm.\n\nWe may be overdue for a next math, as distinct from the New Math of the 1960s, and the New New Math that LAUSD has been revamping and/or fighting over. Remember what sparked New Math in the first place: a sense of falling behind in the aerospace sector.\n\nThe preschool I\u2019m brainstorming about is private. The private sector has more freedom to innovate sometimes, depending on its management hierarchy.\u00a0\n\nI\u2019ve been a critic of the \u201ccharter school\u201d namespace as it can\u2019t seem to make up its \u201cmind\u201d about too many key issues (is a charter school really public or really private?). \u00a0We don\u2019t have infinite time in which to our resolve our issues. Time to remap to new namespaces. \u00a0I go back to my Pirate Party planks.",
