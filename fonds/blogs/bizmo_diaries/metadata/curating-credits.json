  "content": "As a kid, one of my hobbies was using the parental tape recording unit to capture my favorite opening credit sequences on tape.\u00a0 Cassette tape.\n\nBy \"opening credit sequence\" I mean where they get you with imagery, theme music, names of actors, directors, producers... all that.\n\nI recognized the talent that goes into establishing the atmospherics for a program in but seconds.\u00a0 In computer terms, we're talking about a boot loader, or a context switch.\n\nAnyway, along those lines, I'd like to give my own award to Westworld (HBO), for really fine stage setting.\u00a0 The technology suggested is way higher than we have, and answers questions that might nag like:\u00a0 can you do a human eye?\n\n\"We can\" say the credits, and so much more.\u00a0 That's the premise, however fantastic.\u00a0 Science fiction is characterized by wild sets of premises, is it not?",
