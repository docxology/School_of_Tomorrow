  "content": "The rulers scour the landscape for whom the true believers are following.\u00a0 Having zealots and fanatics on one's side is a double edge sword, but there's always postponing the day of reckoning.\u00a0 No one is really ready for Judgement Day, when it comes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWittgenstein was more of the \"every day is judgement day\" school, but you couldn't say that quiet part out loud a lot. I've followed Wittgenstein since first exposure in the 1970s (he died before I was born).\n\nHow do we ceremoniously and with gravitas create more autonomy for ourselves, whoever we are?\u00a0 Many ethnicities would enjoy their own nation, or so they tell themselves, or at least one of the tribal kind from which the concept first emerged ( in conjunction with \"race\" in Social Darwinism).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe \"tolerant\" nation of many tribes working together is more an adaptation of the Iroquois Federation and Roman Empire memes, with the UK on the template of the latter.\u00a0 Arab empires also allowed for local folk religions and even stole (borrowed, appropriated) the best ideas (likewise the Catholics are known for this).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMany who long for a nation are hearkening back to something tribal, not a federation of any kind.\u00a0 A federation comes across as more abstract, more aloof, and more secular, in the sense of not being programmed exclusively by the locals, of any region where it occurs.\u00a0 That's often what the independently minded are seeking to escape, just such an aloof and removed government.\n\nWhen it comes to joining a Federation, topological questions of contiguity enter the picture.\u00a0 The United States counts a smattering of non-state members, such as Puerto Rico and the military base at Guantanamo. What if another far flung island wants to join the federation, not as a state, but as another protectorate?\u00a0 What if it's not an island?\u00a0 What if the District agrees the new territory would be a welcome addition?\u00a0 What is the process and are those wheels too rusted, in this day and age, to ever turn?\n\nThe anthropological question before us is one of invocation and declaration.\u00a0 On the one hand, you have schools telling us the nation state heuristic is inevitably fading, given the only logical dimensions to this puzzle are planetary, whereas on the other you have elaborate mechanisms, steeped in ritual and ceremony, designed to do social engineering, as an official responsibility.\u00a0 What is reinventing itself, and what is breaking down more permanently?\u00a0 This is always the question at the institutional level.\n\nWe may be clearer on what it takes to \"break away\" versus \"join\" e.g. the two republics at the center of the current military fiasco.\u00a0 When a central government is shelling your civilians on a daily basis, one may seek a diplomatic solution, or declare independence, find allies, and choose war.\u00a0 Given the close proximity of an existing federation (the Russian one), the phenomenon of breakaway republics is no surprise.\u00a0 The other side did not want diplomacy either, trusting in its military advantage.\n\nWe also talk about centrifugal forces within the North American federation, of Lower48 + the Canadian provinces + Belize & Baja, Mexico.\u00a0 The sanctions imposed by the District, on its western states especially, has criminalized most of the population (think Prohibition) and forced the entire cannabis economy to short circuit the banking system.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nVarious accommodations with the tax code were negotiated, as what rusty old machine is going to turn down more fuel (revenue)?\u00a0 Obviously no one in \"power\" has the power to stop this particular runaway train.\u00a0 People notice these things.\n\nAn effect of the Drug Wars has been to motivate a psychological breakup that has no real mirror in the paper trail.\u00a0 The melodrama of everyday television hints at these chthonic tensions, but no narrative snowballs, gathering inertia.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis has the effect of melting whatever snowballs are already out there, as the message internally is \"how can those snowballs matter if mine never does?\" i.e. \"what makes their narrative so privileged?\", typically a precursor question to some upsetting of the apple cart.\u00a0 Viewers tune out whole networks, when the content producers never focus on the relevant stories.\u00a0 They vote with their remotes.\n\nIf you check an atlas, you'll likely find that Oregon ranks highly in both Russian and Ukrainian speakers. Migration patterns are such that we have very old school in a mix with newcomers.\u00a0 The same goes for ties to the tribal nations of Japan, Korea, China and so on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nI think of Portland as a Pacific Rim city, a gateway to Eurasia (or just call it all Asia) if you're coming from the American side, where the American side includes all the Americans (from Canada, Mexico, Panama, Brazil and so on).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat this means is a lot of de facto citizen diplomacy (aka university collaborations, businesses), not only between Oregon and the Americas, but between Oregon and Asia.\u00a0 Like any world municipality, Portland is a switchboard, a router, even a CPU / GPU on Motherboard Earth.\n\nFinally, for this blog post, let me remind readers of the focus on Virtual Nations in the 21st Century. These are nation-like self governing semi-autonomous, but without the contiguous borders that would make them United Nations style nation-states.\u00a0 Some may have a Vatican-sized campus here and there, and may fly a flag, but they're not agitating to issue passports in most cases, or do so as a sales gimmick, without monkeying in international law.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWill future VNs do more with ID?\u00a0 Naturally.\u00a0 Behind VNs are webs of blogs, logs, vlogs and databases, and maybe even a currency or two.\n\nIf you think this idea of VNs is unrealistic, consider Shell and Nestles, consider Disney (when it comes to Vatican-sized campuses or bigger).\u00a0 Consider that VNs go way back by other nomenclature.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nConsider universities going forward, and the federations they may form.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSupranational circuitry is nothing new. Global shipping companies have a similar sheen, in that their logos show up everywhere, yet few imagine them on a world map.\n\nGiven these many circuitry overlays, facilitated by more of a shared file system, the question becomes whether bureaucracy itself needs a new space in which to operate.\u00a0 I'm not talking about global government (science fiction) so much as global infrastructure (a fact).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat's chipping away at the power of the old guard, while empowering an avant-garde, is the unwillingness of the old ideologies to think globally, a limitation designed in on purpose.\u00a0 The District refuses to consider the security concerns of rival federations as a foreign policy guide.\u00a0 That's what \"self interested\" is supposed to mean (to them).\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBut at what point does the bureaucracy itself discover it couldn't force itself to think that way even if it wanted to?\u00a0 The bureaucracy has gone global even if the chief functionaries stick to obsolete rhetoric.\n\nWhen I say \"systems have a half life\" I'm not saying \"because other systems will destroy them\". On the contrary, the model of radioactive decay is a \"from within\" phenomenon.\u00a0 Alpha and beta particles leak away.\u00a0 Atoms do in fact change species.\u00a0 They \"fall downhill\" in a way that major stars counteract.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nStar cookers will fuse together atoms of very high atomic number.\u00a0 But at a certain size, they're not really meant for this universe, and they start to break down.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIdeological systems display similar limitations, in coming up against laws of physics, more than anything man made.\n\nI make this distinction because it helps counter the \"commie under every bed\" boogeyman paranoias that seek to explain systemic degradation of one kind or another.\u00a0 Circling a natural process prompts the realization that nature herself plays a role, and yes, humanity is a part of nature.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe circuity in question encompasses the ecosystem, not just the human \"value added\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe erosion of nation-state aesthetics need not trace to a tiny cadre of committed activists or anything like that.\u00a0 No one has to lift a finger with that specific intent.\u00a0 On the contrary, the predominant intent has been to foster and bolster nationhood, in the face of mounting odds.",
