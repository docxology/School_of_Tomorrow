Of course there's political pressure to not need any US combat forces, merely pointing out the fact that you can't assume, just because you see US troops patrolling in an Iraqi town, that a violation has occurred.  You'll need to do more investigative journalism -- as it might be a violation, just have to dig.Replying to Truthout article [Kill the Indian.
