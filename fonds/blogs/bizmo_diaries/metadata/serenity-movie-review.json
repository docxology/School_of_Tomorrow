  "content": "This is a solid representative of the genre science fiction.  It hits the sweet spot, and not in  a glitzy, over-budgeted kind of way.  It's a well-told story, of the kind that would've bought Scheherazade another day's reprieve.The Alliance has won, with defeated rebel non-believers living as outlaws in the outskirts.  And then there are devils (the vampires of this world), and a Slayer.  [Joss Whedon](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/wanderering-in-pdx.html) tells it [again](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-tv-talk.html).This is high TV more than over-the-top big screen, in terms of props -- enough to fuel the imagination. The story and the acting make up for the only decent special effects.  [eXistenZ](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/10/good-night-and-good-luck-movie-review.html) was in this same category, and likewise brilliant.The Alliance has upset the balance of nature and doesn't want you to know -- has enlisted a blind fanatic to keep you from finding out.  But the human psyche is unerring when it comes to unearthing secrets of this type, and responds with integrity.Moral: human nature isn't easily improved upon by humans themselves.  In a fiercesome furnace we were forged.  Don't mess with us.  And we love our psycho-warrior children.",
