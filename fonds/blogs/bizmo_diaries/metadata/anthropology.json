  "content": "Vi Hart reminds me of [Amber Case](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/07/oscon-2015-continues.html), another cyber-anthropologist.\n\nHer usually lighthearted Youtube series attracted the attention of John Green and others caught up in a first wave of Internet personalities becoming semi-famous.\n\nEveryone had their own TV station.\u00a0 A few took full advantage of that fact (I have [a channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr7TZxfhsqbeiQzLnHdgPgA) going back as well, somewhat mathy, where I take up such topics as [hypertoons](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/07/hypertoons-etc.html)).\n\nI say usually lighthearted in contrast to the two below, wherein Vi wrestles with her karma, bravely and honestly, with the slings and arrows taking their toll.\u00a0 I wouldn't claim to being unscathed myself.\u00a0 The war has been ugly.\n\nHere's hoping Vi gets back to her naturally cheerful state.\u00a0 I think it's a sign of the times that a lot of our semi-famous and famous personalities are showing more wear and tear than usual.\u00a0 That's because we're seeing how things could be pretty good, ongoing.\u00a0 That's a lot to lose.",
