  "content": "Not my fault that \"scoop\" rhymes with \"pooper scooper\", which any dog lover knows, you must take to the park to be a good citizen.  Dog poop left untended by the dog owner might as well be just pooping in public.  Take plastic bags, at the very least.So the journalism spin tends to fall by the wayside in some circles (namespaces), as in journalism you want that inside scoop.  \"Scoop of ice cream\" is still a good thing.  \"Two scoops please\", is a [very Ben & Jerry's](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/11/artifact.html) kind of thing to say, very Norman Rockwell.
