  "content": "Old timers among us may still remember when Nietzsche, a Prussian (then stateless) philosopher, was blamed for helping the Nazis fashion their idiotic Aryan superman idea (not at all what Nietzsche had in mind, that much we now know), a fantasy designed to whip up war hysteria and feed a sense of manifest destiny.\n\nMy Princeton education helped fill me in on what really happened.  One of Nietzsche's best translators, [Walter Kaufmann](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/12/superman-returns-movie-review.html), my teacher at Princeton, made a career out of fighting the Nazis, plus check out this quote from Nietzsche's own Twilight of the Idols:\n\nOne pays heavily for coming to power: power makes stupid. The Germans -- once they were called the people of thinkers: do they think at all today? The Germans are now bored with the spirit, the Germans now mistrust the spirit; politics swallows up all serious concern for really spiritual matters. Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles -- I fear that was the end of German philosophy. [1]\nVery prescient (we're talking like 1888).  [Lots of parallels](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/11/world-game-museum.html) to our own time.\n\nKaufmann was adamant that we ought not waste time reading Heidegger, given he'd sold out when it counted.  You should judge a philosophy by the character of the philosopher, was his message.\n\nSince WWII, from such histories as [War Against the Weak](http://www.waragainsttheweak.com/), we've learned a lot about where Hitler did get much of his conceptual ammo: from North American eugenicists, many of them establishment types. [2]\n\nThe best we can say of 20th century philosophy is we're still here in the 21st, and becoming more viable.  That's not really high praise though -- closer to \"minimum acceptable.\"  Academics are still pretty spineless, even today, especially those so-called philosophers (we've not had many of Kaufmann's caliber -- too much inbreeding I suppose (in a memetic sense, not talking genetics)).\n\nAnyway, I'm glad we're overcoming at last (long overdue).\n\n[1] Walter Kaufmann, The Portable Nietzsche, Penguin Books reprint, 1977, page 506.\n\n[2] very lame to go after the Bush family on this however, as Kitty Kelly makes clear after checking into it more thoroughly\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj4GAIve600k2b7jqq1lf4C30J2QlbXSngU808QL7LmGrxeQrDgGMg0ZGX5Iv6eyBlSRxBmJ1nxM8b9bAYPlnCHHL-wHjSUnXBYV9h9PMRKxF3WYu7OQIlrnK4F-kMC43A6YMsi/s1600-h/gwb.jpg)",
