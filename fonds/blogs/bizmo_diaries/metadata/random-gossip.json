  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/2992608615/in/photolist-5yrUhg-75tSeE)\n\nFrom some Facebook timeline somewhere:\n\nI'm still trying to figure out the IRA game (Internet Research Agency) as \nresearch seemed what it was up to:  stage events, gain followers, sell \nstuff, promote memes... but to what end?  Twas Bannon of Cambridge \nAnalytica who overtly copped to trying to win \nelections, with that whole scary backstory about the secret Facebook \nquiz.  Facebook took the heat and learned to kowtow.\n\nI bet IRA was more \"oligarchs playing with the west's new toys\" trying to\nget in on the ground floor playing the new social media capitalist \ngame.  Swinging the election was likely not a motive, not at all.  My \nhypothesis.  Facebook and Google are global goliaths and the Russians assume (as I do) that they're just as entitled to their troll farms as any lobby \ngroup.  IRA actually stood up to Mueller saying it had every right to \nplay the game and Mueller backed down, seeing this as a footnote in \nhistory he'd like us to forget.\n\nOn the other hand, the whole Guccifer 2 business and Crowdstrike is a \nseparate narrative and there we're told the GRU itself has its hands in \neverything, and working on Trump's behalf was definitely the goal in \nthat case.  The Mueller report goes into great detail, showing the \nRussians snapping to attention when Trump called for them to find those \nmissing Hill-Billary emails.  The only weakness in the narrative there  \nis CrowdStrike wrote it under contract, with the FBI in no position to \naudit, only coach and cajole to get the narrative it wanted.  It's not \nwhat I'd call highly credible, even if it's in the Congressional Record \n(so is a lot of other garbage).",
