  "content": "My dad subscribed to The Futurist and thought like one.\u00a0 Fifty year plans were his bread and butter.\u00a0 He helped get systems going, for the longer haul.\u00a0 Naturally, some of that rubbed off, these being memes, not so much genes (or jeans).\n\nWhat I've found is I sometimes pray / predict / prophecy some future development, but then not recognize when it actually happens.\u00a0 There's a lag as I adjust to the vision being just alien enough to be not seem purely a product of my own imagination (not a criticism).\u00a0 Youtube, for example:\u00a0 I used to write sundry strange things about [The Videogrammatron](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/videogrammatron.html), short clips, a database, hyperlinks between them.\u00a0 All that happened, not using my nomenclature and so almost escaping my notice at first, as my prayers already answered.\n\nAnother case in point:\u00a0 I used to visualize that \"virtual companies\" that would conjure floorspace using the cloud.\u00a0 Certain floors would be occupied, as a team suddenly appeared, conducted business, and moved on, like gypsies.\u00a0 But now, sitting in this Hyatt in Santa Clara, taken over by the Python geeks of the world, as a paid, booked in advance venue, I realize that's how it already is:\u00a0 floor space materializes even as people jet in. Convergence / divergence.\u00a0 That's what's going on here.\u00a0 And that's the conference biz, people meeting about anything and everything.\n\nTrue, I was thinking more small teams traveling in packs, but we have those too.\u00a0 People come here as members of a tribe, a company, a nation, a virtual nation.\u00a0 Henrique said I could quote him, about how it's \"more and more awesome\" every year, in terms of how many familiars from around the planet one gets to greet and catch up with.\n\nThe Oregonian wrote me up twice, Carlin the journalist both times maybe.\u00a0 The second time I was predicting hypertext kiosks in hospitals.\u00a0 This was before people knew what hypertext was.\u00a0 [The first time](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/in-news.html) I was shown holding a postcard next to my head, of Fuller's global data projection.\u00a0 That was in the Metro section only I'm pretty sure.",
