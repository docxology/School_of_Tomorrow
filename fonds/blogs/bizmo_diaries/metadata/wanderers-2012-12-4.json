  "content": "Tonight we were graced with the presence of Sylvia Benner, along with [David DiNucci](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/8233461651/in/photostream), both legitimate spokespeople for the atheist and secular humanist community in Greater Portland.\u00a0 Both were articulate and informative.\u00a0 Wanderers are very receptive to these subcultures, having no set in stone doctrinal dogmas (we have a coffee fund).\u00a0 [Bill Shepard](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/07/wanderers-2009715.html) despised telling children about Santa Claus (in the sense of tricking them into false beliefs).\u00a0 A lot of atheists are refugees from various religions, some disowned by their families.\u00a0 Until recently, admitting to being an atheist was like committing social suicide.\u00a0 You were a \"godless commie\" or whatever.\n\nBoth principals spoke with experience about the stresses of creating community.\u00a0 People come in various stages of some progression.\u00a0 Some feel deeply scarred and are angry at a particular religion.\u00a0 Others seek low voltage interactions, nothing melodramatic.\u00a0 The mix of characters may prove volatile.\u00a0 A kind of alchemy goes on.\n\nI could identify.\u00a0 I was sitting way in the back, in a nice comfy chair, mostly sitting in rapt attention, engaging in the discussion (\"is the Dalai Lama an atheist?\") but also focusing on [a Quaker blog](http://quakersusanne.wordpress.com/2012/11/24/another-difficult-topic-sex-offenders-and-quakers/) that had been brought to our attention by one of our members.\u00a0 Once again (like in [those movies](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/11/occupy-unmasked-movie-review.html)), rape was an issue.\u00a0 [Various brands](http://quakersusanne.wordpress.com/2012/12/01/discipline-and-emotions-sex-offenders-and-quakers-part-ii/) of sex offender want community too.\u00a0 Why not check out the Quakers, as they're probably not armed and likely not dangerous.\u00a0 Sometimes it's tiring to have to watch one's back every day.\u00a0 We get our share of tourists, looking for something more permanent.\u00a0 Just like the humanists do.\n\nSylvia was on the whole upbeat about the future.\u00a0 The fact that so many young people were not bothered by atheism as a position, had no bigotry against it, felt encouraging.\u00a0 Maybe the world was growing more rational and intelligent?\u00a0 Some statistics seemed to show that.\n\nIn some followup conversation I mentioned about being [a Quaker animist](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/01/lunch-in-old-town.html).\u00a0 Like many humanists, I'm not that sapien-centric in that I respect and celebrate the nonhuman crew members aboard Spaceship Earth.\n\nOne of my themes for the Wanderers is we admit nonhuman members, and sure enough we had a dog present for this meeting, at the cost of come controversy given it snored loudly enough to interfere with some humans' hearing of the other humans.\n\nDuane Ray was by, haven't seen him in awhile, among other prominent movers and shakers.\u00a0 We weren't all in totalitarian agreement on anything.\u00a0 The discussion revealed rifts, but then consensus regarding belief systems was never the game or goal.\n\nLabeling and taxonomy were a core focus.\u00a0 Are polytheists atheists?\u00a0 The obvious answer is \"no\", but then if you've never believed in \"one god\" that seems somewhat atheistic to any God promoted as the one and only.\u00a0 \"Apathist\" was another term bandied about.\u00a0 Unlike the \"agnostic\" who either \"doesn't know\" or thinks people \"can't know\", the apathist just \"doesn't care\" one way or the other.\u00a0 If one's commitment is to live an ethical life irrespective of stated beliefs, then \"knowing\" (in the sense of indulging in metaphysical belief systems) may be unnecessary.",
