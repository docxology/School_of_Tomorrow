  "content": "I'd recommend skipping the step where we use the draft to force social protest and instead open up service options wherein those conscientiously opposed to violence aren't made to jump through hoops.\u00a0A national chain of farms, hotels, gas stations... not government takeover of whole sectors, but get in there and get your hands dirty with transparent think tank designed versions of these institutions, showing imagination in ways the private sector wants to copy.\u00a0The brain drain from public to private has been such that governments have been left to die in the desert at this point, except insofar as they provide a thin veneer of legitimacy for the mass murder that goes on.\u00a0As long as mass media's job is to inflame the kind of virulent patriotism that makes 'em mindlessly bomb happy, we'll need government and religious icons to whip us into a frenzy.-- some town hall on Facebook somewhere",
