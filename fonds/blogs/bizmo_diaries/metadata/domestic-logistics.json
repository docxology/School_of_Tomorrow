Letting an oil furnace run out of fuel (my bad) puts air or worse in the line, making a restart difficult sometimes.\u00a0\n\nOne ends up phoning a technician. The technician usually does a hard sell on rebuilding the whole furnace. Should I convert the house to gas?\u00a0 Not an option at the moment.\n\nThe new Samsung dishwasher appears up to the task. The guys who put it in clearly have their choreography down. Efficient.\n\nThe furnace wouldn't come on at first.\u00a0 The fuel line from under the driveway is quite long. I kept at it, pressing the red button at long intervals, and finally, ignition.\u00a0 The line was cleared.\n\nI'm back to keeping the household running smoothly, for a 62 and almost 92 year old, during a pandemic. Many thanks to my friends who help out in so many ways.",
