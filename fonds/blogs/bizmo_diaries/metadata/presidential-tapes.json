  "content": "I've been interested in the [taped conversations](http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/04/eveningnews/main4649083.shtml) we've been hearing lately, from past Vietnam War era administrations under Johnson and Nixon.President Johnson seemed to have a better appreciation of his situation, in saying he'd need to be stripped of his war powers, maybe kicked out of office, before he capitulated to anti-war sentiments.Like a [typical Texan](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/01/local-issues.html), he put troops in harms way (intentionally), then considers it his patriotic duty to protect said troops from harm come hell or high water -- a kind of begging the question as to why the troops needed to be there in the first place, especially in light of the low value North Americans tend to put on the lives of other \"far away\" peoples (cite General Westmoreland in [Hearts and Minds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071604/), dismissing Asian attitudes towards death as \"not like ours\").Buddhist students get schooled in the arts of debate, much as American children are in our better high schools.  They're prepared to defend themselves in ideological and psychological games of poker.  But then the Texans are always losing (because stupid?) and pulling out a gun, refusing to play fair.  The rest of the nation pays dearly.I'm glad Texas is out of power these days, don't think it should have been allowed in the Union, big mistake, [look at Enron](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/06/concept-car.html) (shades of GM?).[Go Britney](http://www.imdb.com/video/cbs/vi2912420633/)!  Our [music millenium](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/01/more-music-millenium-notes.html) is off to a great start.",
