I do agree that one culture may seize upon the memes of another, and from the standpoint of the originator, the new uses may come across as abuses.\u00a0 \"Are they mocking us?\"\u00a0 Maybe.\u00a0 I'm not denying the \"reality\" of \"culture wars\" per se.\n\nIn my ethnicity, we have this idea of \"class extends\" as in Java.\u00a0 The equivalent notion of \"subclass\" gives rise to different mental pictures.\u00a0 The \"extend\" is to expand into a wide open space, it seems, wheres \"to subclass\" since like going inward to create yet a more specialized version of something.\u00a0 Both connotations have their echo in actual computer programming.\n\nHaving done the Wy'East Lakota-based training, with sweat lodges, talking sticks, other accoutrements, especially the Medicine Wheel, I'm thinking to extend it (not steal it) to mean what it already means:\u00a0 the four directions.\u00a0 This is not a new thought for me, but perhaps my powers to propagate have amplified over time.\n\nBy \"four directions\" though, I mean \"in space\".\u00a0 Paint the four faces of a tetrahedron:\u00a0 yellow, white, black, red.\u00a0 Four faces face the fullness of space by dividing it into four quadrants.\u00a0 We might call this \"the arrowhead\" and its four points are likewise four pointers, indicative of space's 4Dness.\n\nWherever three face colors meet, the vertex might be of the missing color.\n\nIf made of stretched skin or hide, you'll have the connotation of \"drum\" and also \"resonance\".",
