Then surface streets to Marine Drive in Troutdale, and a loop back around Bybee Lake, then back to downtown by way of the University of Portland and the Broadway Bridge.The finishing line, like the starting line, was in the PSU park blocks.About 50 miles all told.Our party:  Larry, Gordon, Suzanne and myself, later joined by Brian with the way cool bike with radio controlled gears.Larry is a pilot in training, and [organizational consultant](http://www.360compass.com/). Gordon helps support people who prefer cash to credit cards for phone bills and such.  Both Larry's and Gordon's kids tend to speak more than just English.Suzanne has a lot of [street cred](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=street+cred) in NGO world, including in [Sri Lanka](http://www.sarvodayausa.org/suzanne_report.php).Larry and Suzanne were my ride mates for this year's Bridge Pedal as well, along with Larry's wife Chris.  Great seeing Gordon again.",
