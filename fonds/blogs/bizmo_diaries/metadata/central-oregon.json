His wife took our order and their daughter cashed us out.\n\nToday we visited the place where the Metolius river emerges from underground.\u00a0 No one really knows its route under the Cascades.\u00a0 Once it emerges, it runs for about twelve miles to a lake, through forest populated by camp grounds and \"summer cabins\" (many have been turned into more than just cabins).\u00a0 We picnicked along the shore, then drove into Sisters for music by Tony Lompa, who remembered me from last time.\n\nTomorrow we'll be listening to Steve's radio show on KPOV, and probably talking to Steve himself.\u00a0 \n\nI drove the girls to the alpaca farm just a mile down the road on highway 97.\u00a0 Then we visited Smith Rock.\u00a0 These are ritual stops for us.\n\nI'll be adding pictures when home in Portland.\n\nI'm meditating on how people seem to want it both ways:\u00a0 we acknowledge a deeply non-rational side the motivates human affairs, and then try to give a role to rationality.\n\nClearly engineering based on awareness of generalized principles gives us more ways to act out our collective craziness, for better and/or for worse.\n\nIn the media, crazy meets crazy and tries to sort itself out.\u00a0 That's called history or culture or something along those lines. \n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/42949796155/in/dateposted-public/)",
