  "content": "Excavating one's office can mean a lot of archeology.\u00a0 I'm vacating a multi-desk zone and setting up shop elsewhere in the building.\u00a0 It's a business decision.\u00a0 [Renovations must occur](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/02/reconstruction-phase-2.html).\u00a0 No one stays in that office except construction workers and me, continuing with demolition (that will be Phase 2).\n\nI've got the Raspberry Pi moved but not yet on the router.\u00a0 The Airbook is talking to the old Qwest DSL modem.\u00a0 That's enough to keep me busy.\u00a0 OK, I've just made sure the Pi is browsing now too.\n\nMelody is at our workplace, checking out the new shipment (from Montana), ordered by Lindsey.\u00a0 I was out at PDX this morning (airport).",
