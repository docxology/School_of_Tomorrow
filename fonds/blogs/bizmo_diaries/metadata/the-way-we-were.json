  "content": "I'm thinking of Richard Burton singing his \"one shining moment, Camelot\" swan song.\u00a0 This isn't one exactly, but I'm thinking at our peak we were like one of those QVS houses.\n\nThat's Quaker Volunteer Services, where Friends live together, perform community service, walking their talk in terms of Quaker values.\n\nPer recent ministry in meeting, there's no oxymoron in \"Quaker witch\". They all do non-violent communication workshops or are just generally non-threatening (talking about the witches living here).\n\nHowever Melody, who works with homeless / runaway youth, kids in dire straits, has since moved out.\u00a0 She still stays as a guest, but you need a certain number of knights to have a round table.\n\nI was the role model Quaker in staying with my inward weapons, gallivanting about in cyberspace, weaving in threads.\u00a0 It's not like we'd all sit in a circle reading the Bible together.\u00a0 This is more a Western Friend household, so we might read more Jung.\u00a0 We had some [movie nights](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-lady-movie-review.html).\n\nJenQ helped write and publish The Radicle and was a key organizer for Food Not Bombs.\n\nAnyway, that was the hay day.\u00a0 Both the clerk and assistant clerk have been by in the last few days, visiting Carol, the treasured elder, board member of AFSC and perpetual WILPF strategist.\n\nWe were a buzzing headquarters we were (Melody just left again).\n\nWe were subscribed to The Economist, The Nation and The New York Times.\u00a0 Our Wall Street Journal subscription, based on frequent flyer miles, had expired.\u00a0 I also got Princeton Alumni Weekly.\u00a0 Our Internet was through CenturyLink, DSL.",
