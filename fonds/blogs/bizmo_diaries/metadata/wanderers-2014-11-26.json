  "content": "We had one of our best turnouts ever today, with people we practically never see.\u00a0 Coffee was in high demand.\u00a0 I said I'd be more like a photographer at a wedding and move about, then fade away as my day job is peaking.\u00a0 Just getting to join was a privilege, with family and friends.\n\nOur topic was Matriarchy, beginning with concerns about definition and semantics.\u00a0 Matriarchy is not \"just the opposite\" of Patriarchy, but then what's the latter?\u00a0 Matrilineal is easier to define.\u00a0 In Patriarchy, the fathers have a stronger \"need to know\" regarding the paternity of children, as property passes father to sons, or any offspring per King Lear.\u00a0 In Matriarchy, paternity doesn't matter as much and the mother's brother may be head of household, with her husband the head of another household.\n\nConstance Tippett Chandler was our presenter.\u00a0 She's an artist who shapes a concept of history as from clay, with attention to detail and scholarship.\u00a0 Matriarchy is less concerned about gender, though patterns around gender may well develop.\u00a0 \"Whoever is most fit for the job\" was her response to division of labor questions.\u00a0 Creating the ethics in the moment as a way of unearthing a distant culture in the past may seem like undue editorializing, but as performance-based conceptual art, it makes sense.\n\nGiven circumstances, looming work-related tasks, I took my leave somewhat early and missed a lot of the discussion.\u00a0 Do we really find evidence of a Matriarchal layer in Old Europe circa 7500 BC?\u00a0 We do find a lot of sophistication about time and cycles back then, astounding pottery, evidence of successful civilization.\u00a0 But what do we know about the social order?\n\nIn Connie's telling, that layer of history, or prehistory, is buried with [the invasion of the Kurgans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan_hypothesis), after which the archeological record shows plentiful weapons cluttering up the landfill, up until our day.\u00a0 We're still the war-prone heirs of the horse-mounted bullies who imposed far stricter rules to the point of enslavement.\u00a0 Patriarchy is a lot about asceticism, rank, policing others.\u00a0 More fascist.\n\nObviously much discussion could flow from such a storytelling.\u00a0 The Confederated Tribes of the Iroquois, by some accounts a model for the Federation of States branding as \"USA\" in later chapters, was Matriarchal.\u00a0 In Connie's telling, the patriarchy reached a corrupt phase and downward spiral out of which the matriarchy then emerged.\u00a0 Could this happen again?",
