However that doesn't mean that lifestyle is immune from overhaul in other dimensions.\u00a0EV trucking might be a thing (Tesla testing) but probably only if cabs decouple from payloads more, i.e. it's super easy to drop a trailer and head to charging, while another cab takes the payload onward with very little downtime.\u00a0Cabs queue and charge at a slower rate but there's always enough of them.Trucking companies might choose a \"driver stays with the payload\" policy and have the driver hop from cab to cab, or the driver could stay with the cab and get hitched to different trailers going from A to B all day, not much rhyme or reason from the driver viewpoint but expertly routed by Mother (the company computers).",
