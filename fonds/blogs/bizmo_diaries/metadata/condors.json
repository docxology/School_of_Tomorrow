  "content": "I was on duty chauffeuring, drinking coffee at the base of the tram.\u00a0 A guy zoomed up in his wheel chair.\u00a0 \"Is that a computer?\" he asked, in child-like wonder.\u00a0 Hadn't seen an Air before. I emphasized it was light weight (unlike its owner).\n\nThen who should walk in to the scene but Brian Sharp, one of our Wanderers, but often remote, in central Oregon, and mostly contacting by list (Yahoo group).\u00a0 We talked for awhile about this and that, then it was off to Providence, from OHSU.\u00a0 Back to OHSU later.\n\nBrian followed [pilot projects](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/03/social-security-for-condors.html) to reintroduce the condors to North America.\u00a0 They'd had a life here in Oregon, per records, but have long since died out.\u00a0 Brian does not see a way to bring them back in our particular era; the problems are insoluble at the moment.\u00a0 But he has been working on a book about what it used to be like, and why they once thrived here.\u00a0 That book is due out soon.\n\nWhy they can't survive now traces mainly to man-made substances in the environment that subvert their lifestyle.\u00a0 Lead shot in animal carcasses proves toxic over time, but also the pabulum they regurgitate to infants:\u00a0 these have more plastics in them, fragments of non-biodegradable things.\u00a0 These tend to clog up digestive systems.\u00a0 Not enough survive to make it a viable community.\n\nBrian was recently back from a San Diego championship tournament wherein his soccer team was best in the over-64 class. He's run the circumference of planet Earth three times if you add up his frequent player soccer miles.",
