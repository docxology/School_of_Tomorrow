  "content": "Excerpt from recent correspondence (email to Maurice, Apr 20, 2021, 3:02 AM ), regarding Kenneth Snelson's relationship with Bucky Fuller:He was always trying to figure out where the narrative was going to go around Bucky.\u00a0 Was the guy a genius or a crackpot and to what extent would tensegrity be tarnished or polished by the association?\u00a0 Had he been victimized somehow, was the core question, e.g. by a mad man with a messiah complex?\u00a0 A lot hinged on what a next generation did with the whole corpus.\u00a0 He was still trying to see the future.\u00a0 That's why he reached out to me, an early\u00a0web guy focusing on Bucky stuff, both to warn me about what he called the Church of Bucky, and to get a sense of where said \"church\" might be going in future, as that would inevitably be impacting the Snelson story and reputation as well.I don't think his question was ever fully answered, and that had been the problem all along:\u00a0 an inability to reach consensus on the nature and/or level of Bucky's game.\u00a0 He somewhat resented the sense that, as a Black Mountain College student, he'd been left to figure that all out for himself.\u00a0 Bucky was looking at Snelson as a possible protege, and given how mission-critical the former thought his own work might be, that put Kenneth under a lot of pressure.\u00a0 He just wanted to enjoy being a college kid and having a girlfriend.\u00a0 That he was put in the position of needing to assess Bucky was in some ways infuriating.\u00a0 Others should be helping more.\u00a0\u00a0To make a long story short, he eventually fell in with a crowd who assured him Bucky was pretty much a charlatan and he'd be doing us a service by fighting him directly and publicizing their\u00a0tug-o-war over intellectual property (both were patenting).\u00a0 Kenneth thought they had something like a truce, an understanding:\u00a0 Bucky would stay out of the art world and leave \"tensegrity as art\" to Kenneth, as what could a design science guy need with pure art?\u00a0 Then it appeared Bucky transgressed that line, and was moving into the art world himself, and that's when Kenneth put on his battle armor.\u00a0\u00a0But then people such as myself gave him pause. Maybe there was something to it all after all?\u00a0 We discussed these matters at some length, why not?\u00a0 He was a really charming guy, easy to get along with.\u00a0 We both had daughters.\u00a0 I took mine to New York City to visit that\u00a0time, and show her some of my young adulthood haunts in Jersey City.\u00a0\u00a0We exchanged a lot of emails, Kenneth and I, none of which I've kept as if he'd wanted those kept, he'd have archived them on his end, as he was very organized.\u00a0 Maybe he did, I don't know.\u00a0 He was also handsome and athletic.\u00a0 He didn't like old age and what it did to him.\u00a0 He was having a brilliant life.\u00a0 Who'd want to ever let go of such an amazing scenario?",
