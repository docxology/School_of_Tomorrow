  "content": "Continuing with the appliance theme, the bionics, I got my yearly diagnostic at the hospital the other day. There's one number in particular, a physical dimension (width) we're keeping an eye on. No change. That's good.\n\nI guess I like the term \"bioneer\" OK. Better than \"bionista\". I echo Guido's dislike of \"pythoneer\", much preferring \"pythonista\". So does that make me inconsistent?\u00a0 Not really.\u00a0 We want to keep the \"engineer\" meme.\u00a0 \"One who deals with engines\".\u00a0 Intellect:\u00a0 that which busies itself with thoughts, while remaining its own thing.\n\nI was lurking on Srikant's seminar room again today (52 Living Ideas).\u00a0 The est Seminars sometimes endeavored to such collegiate levels, but in opening one's doors to the masses, you're not necessarily soliciting the most high brow of conversations.\u00a0 This one was about \"Faculty Psychology\" or \"the Psychology of Faculties\" and, in particular, the cogitative (no, not cognitive) sense, per St. Thomas Aquinas.\u00a0\n\n\"Bioneer\" for me is a slightly tongue in cheek swap-in for \"farmer\" where today's farmer is not some left-in-the-dark peasant, but a very globally aware technologist, at the intersection of a great many industries, from entomology, to chemistry, to climate science, to marketing, to cybernetics and synergetics.\u00a0 Farmers make use of their cogitative sense at a high level.",
