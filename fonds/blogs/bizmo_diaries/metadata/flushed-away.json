The flush was too weak.\u00a0 I'd sabotaged the toilet, unwittingly, not acting in my own best interests apparently.\n\nMick the Plumber put the new one in [back in 2012](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/06/consumer-story.html). It had to come from far away, as yellow is not a color much in demand for toilets although I sure it beats red or orange.\n\nFast forward four years, to 2016, and the wax seal has worn away, and the bolts holding it to the floor are shot, weren't much to begin with. \n\nMick arrived just a few hours after my call, and after some dire thoughts about what we might have to do, bought a rebuilding kit and got it working.\n\nNo warranty, because [lead seals](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/05/dumb-houses.html) are problematic by today's standards. \u00a0They wear out.",
