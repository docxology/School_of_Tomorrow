[emphasis added, from pg. 15 of First Free Press soft cover edition, 1967]\nPhilosophers these days are called \"programmers\" but more in terms of theater / TV, converging with \"programmers\" of computers.\u00a0 The computer, like the TV, is a mirror.\u00a0 The TV is a window into the computer (e.g. Netflix) which reflects back the collective psyche of the various cults (subcultures).\n\nPhilosophers consciously re-vector various word-meanings, putting them on arcs or trajectories.\u00a0 We do this by applying \"[spin](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/name-collisions.html)\", hence the term \"spin doctor\".\n\nSlavery is always sneaking back into the picture though.\u00a0 England may have abolished the institution throughout its global empire, but then that empire decayed.\u00a0 Automation because the capitalist industrialists answer to human labor.\u00a0 Machines do not unionize or protest ill-treatment (they simply break down for lack of proper care).\n\nEnding slavery as a global institution is concomitant with increasing automation, but then comes the new problem of what humans are supposed to do with their powers.\n\nSome subcultures have been more successful than others in channeling the power or Real Intelligence (versus Artificial Intelligence), serving as a model for others.\n\nWith the rise of the TV-computer as a kind of shared collective consciousness, we have the ability to nerve ourselves to continue with the advance of civilization.\u00a0 Spin doctors i.e. programmers may be found on both sides.\u00a0 Some want to bring slavery back, or increase its staying power, whereas others expose their agenda and apply counter-intelligence, taking us further towards freedom.\n\nI don't know to what extent Alfred will be mentioning Quakers by name.\u00a0 They've been at the forefront of wanting freedom for all people, having abolished slavery among themselves and helping with the Underground Railroad.\n\nSlave-owning North Americans were uncomfortable with the cognitive dissonance these Quakers engendered, considered them terrifying.\u00a0 Even if Quakers preached non-violence themselves, they might trigger revolutionary movements such as mentioned above.\u00a0 Quakers were pressured to quit the scene and move west, the standard solution for relieving tensions in North America.\u00a0 Their values spread across the mid-west, bringing the seeds of civilization to new settlements.\n\nSo what will Quaker TV look like?\u00a0 [Stay tuned](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/12/convergent-friends.html).",
