  "content": "I was glad to attend Steve Holden's OSCON Survivor's Breakfast, as I'd missed the party for the Program Chair. \n\nThis follow-up event gave me an opportunity to sit at Sarah Novotny's table and personally register my appreciation for the focus on inclusivity, non-profits, collaboration with other disciplines. \n\nEveryone seemed jazzed by [Andrew Sorenson's keynote](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/36818) the morning before, and I filled in more of a picture of the guy, highly regarded. \u00a0We were lucky to have him.\u00a0 I'd watched on Live Steam with somewhat choppy DSL, knowing I could go back to Youtube later (above).\n\nAnother topic at this table was the 40 hour work week, which business analysts back to Henry Ford Sr. had discovered was a local optimum.\u00a0 People need time to recharge and enjoy the fruits of their labors.\u00a0 Without rewards, motivation drops away, and with it, productivity.\u00a0 Yet many in management seem to have forgotten this wisdom, when it comes to exploiting a steady stream of young talent eager for a foot in the door and not realizing they're being set up for PTSD and \"pager hallucinations\" i.e. that feeling of being on call for possible emergencies 24/7.\n\nDuncan told me\u00a0[about Hy](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/), a LISP dialect that's friendly with Python. \u00a0I'm eager to learn more.\n\nAt Tatiana's table, I learned about her pleasant chat with Tim O'Reilly during the interview period at the O'Reilly booth (my role was to be at the OST booth around then). \u00a0She continued the discussion about i18n (internationalization). \n\nI hadn't realized how prolific her father is, in the Portuguese language, sometimes including original translations from Sanskrit in his works. \u00a0Both her parents are university professors.\n\nBy analogy, a future O'Reilly title might go directly from Python to Portuguese and vice versa without going through English along the way i.e. this would not be a translation. \u00a0Tim said he was open to such proposals (but of course it would need to be something more concrete than a mere notion). \u00a0I am grateful to Tati for continuing [the conversation](http://mathforum.org/kb/message.jspa?messageID=9529179).\n\nIn sum, much appreciation was expressed for the program managers and the assemblage of keynotes this year. \u00a0People seemed satisfied this was one of the best OSCONs ever.\n\nThe Hilton provided a world class breakfast and I partook with gusto, having barely touched my food last night after some unfortunate mixing of food and beverage earlier. \u00a0But hey, I survived.\n\nI was glad Don Wardwell of Wanderers could join us. \u00a0He was able to take positive advantage of some of the networking opportunities a room full of such high caliber folks offers.",
