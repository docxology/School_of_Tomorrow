This was another go-round of Pythonic Math, each time with innovations, new proofs (or disproofs) of concept.  I'm finding this round going pretty smoothly, with a lot of credit to my students, mostly eager to be there and learn.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjbUI0e_PSTuXCGzB0BkricM9_gwwPWBo7HTJlI5ocjyxuoPDN9ZT68EmPIpDD11vyptF-hHyfQJKD1QJ6yrH-MVYNau3IN5l8lNsOQxNv3ehALVU_8kOquqsg-ryL65_e4hBP1/s1600-h/board.jpg):: gray board ::Yesterday, appropriately timed with [Moira's visit](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/07/wanderers-2007718.html), I took a biotech approach to Python, explaining expression fragments, data and control structures, as proteins.  Functions are primitive biota, taking args through a mouth, doing tricks in exchange (preferably not too many tricks per single function).If we want more tricks, stack them along a spine with those special name __ribs__, begetting the skeletal class framework so characteristic of Python.Finally, a module would be like a zoo or aquarium, a place for all of this stuff to share habitat, creating an ecosystem ( = namespace in this namespace).[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjQB-W9Ytf6F0rYjylwNV3IKktL0o1uJdGs1g8YWy3IKUf3Zq6QmVjEcVxhgTrjGW24ES2P7uVWMqHewV_dbXIoes-Qz9E6aXnG7BHBxjeAmcMuIDvHyCPYJ3nabRYiqDKBBfJd/s1600-h/animusic.jpg):: projection mode ::Class Notes on edu-sig: [[1](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-July/008091.html)][[2](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-July/008100.html)][[3](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-July/008117.html)][[4](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2007-July/008129.html)][Comment](http://mail.geneseo.edu/pipermail/math-thinking-l/2007-July/001150.html) on math-thinking-l",
