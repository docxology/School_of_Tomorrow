What\u2019s good about this attitude is that it\u2019s in principle the opposite of authoritarian, a fact which many critics have a hard time seeing. \u00a0\n\n\u201cGod talk\u201d is often characterized as authoritarian by definition and usually highly patriarchal in practice, given the Roman experience (pervasive even today). Certainly subcultures (cults) may be heavy-handed, and sometimes escaping them and their influence is the best course.\n\nHowever, in thanking God, one is pronouncedly not thanking the Emperor for one\u2019s daily bread. It\u2019s not the party, the company, the boss, leaders, visionaries, scientists, or my betters, to whom I am beholden. \u00a0\n\nIf we don\u2019t have our daily bread, some humans are in the way from a systems point of view, maybe the very humans who decided to hike up this unforgiving mountain or dare whatever odds, given physics. \u00a0\n\nGod represents the idea that humans are not the be all end all and that sensibility is vital to keeping the humans-playing-God syndrome from becoming a pandemic. \u00a0\n\nGod represents synergy at a very high level, meaning intelligence flows \u201cabove our heads\u201d, \u201camong the angels\u201d say, or \u201cunconsciously\u201d if you\u2019re more a Freudian, or \u201cin demonic realms\u201d (the trope of an \u201cunderground,\u201d the chthonic). \u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s Ouija Inc. and its many board rooms. Monster U. Wisdom plumbs the deeper depths. It\u2019s not anti-science to say so.\n\nThe prayer of thanks comes from a cybernetician who understands Nature is automated to provide, and humans are a part of that automation. Using the term \u201cautomation\u201d comes across as derogatory perhaps, too mechanical. \u00a0But then humans exult about being in the flow, in the zone, where everything \u201cjust goes\u201d without a lot of overthinking and ego involvement. \u00a0\n\nThat feels like God\u2019s will (Thy will) being done, and it\u2019s a Kingdom of Heaven type experience. The cybernetician is nodding along with all that, likewise prayerful and grateful.\n\nThe fork comes with \u201cdivine right\u201d. \u00a0\n\nSome revolutionaries talk as if we finally closed the door on \u201cdivine\u201d period full stop, in depriving even kings of this status.\n\nOthers say our notion of \u201cdivine\u201d was extended in Democracy, to all, from King to Beggar. That\u2019s where the Quakers came down, around the 1600s. \u00a0\n\nThe idea is our equality, the sense in which we\u2019re equals, is built in to our sense of God\u2019s love. \u00a0When we apply the idea of unconditional love to all humans equally what viewpoint do we get back? \u00a0One that beacons away from putting peers on pedestals, as idols, as God\u2019s competitors.\n\nEnshrining other humans as the source of all that\u2019s good in our lives, including life itself, is a first step down a wrong path. \u00a0Yes, thank your peeps, and be grateful for them. \u00a0But don\u2019t confuse that thankfulness with a growing debt. \u00a0Think of the Sun\u2019s energy. \u00a0Enough of that was meant for you, that you shouldn\u2019t have gone wanting without a scholarship. \u00a0The Sun doesn\u2019t charge a debt to its students.\n\nThank the Sun for your being adequately energized, as a teacher and student in the Global U, not other students or faculty. \u00a0The Sun and the plants impound carbon dioxide and other nutrients, providing the raw ingredients for your cafeteria plan.\n\n\u201cOh so you\u2019re justifying monarchism by using God in a purely political sense, irrespective of His existence\u201d. First, I\u2019m not \u201cjustifying monarchism\u201d or at least not for free. \u00a0You\u2019d need to pay me. Next, I don\u2019t think the political sense would have such staying power if it weren\u2019t also people\u2019s experience that whom they owe for life itself is not the landlord, but the same Lord to whom the landlord owes his own life. That\u2019s more democratic. \u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s no King as Ultimate Landlord model. We each have our private \u201cimage i nation\u201d (private sky). That of God in each of us. Quaker jargon.\n\nThe main debates hinge around laws or rules. Where do \u201crights\u201d come from? Again, I see the reason behind having inalienable rights come from God, and then maybe affirmed or codified in some widely agreed upon document, such as the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThere\u2019s no problem enshrining these rights, just with thinking we owe specific people thanks for providing them in principle. \u00a0Defending them is again different. \u00a0However to what extent is one\u2019s effectiveness, as a defender, dependent on having the right attitude? \u00a0When too much ego gets into the mix, effectiveness may be at risk. So we\u2019re back to Transcendentalism, not as a hindrance to American democracy, but at its foundation.",
