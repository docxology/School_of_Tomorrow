  "content": "We enjoyed our traditional Solstice Potluck at the Linus Pauling House. \u00a0We've celebrated solstices and equinoxes, sometimes in other locations. \n\nFriday was not truly the solstice, but we always choose a Friday for logistical reasons.\n\nOn Saturday, Glenn and I wandered downtown to visit MercyCorps, which has a walk-in exhibit these days, of their various engineering solutions aimed at helping refugees from disasters, who number well over six million worldwide. \n\nI mentioned my dream of having [local houseless participate in prototyping scenarios](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/05/disaster-relief.html) using a collaborative model, nothing imposed.\n\nWe then visited Kell's Irish Pub for Kell's IPA and some World Cup, soccer for women, Germany versus Sweden.\n\nOrdinarily I would have a lot of pictures to go with this narrative, but the Fujifilm XQ-1 is in the shop and the phone ran out of charge around the time I was ready to use it.",
