  "content": "[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/42332790424/in/album-72157695209731812/)\n\nI got some flak on Facebook from one of my friends, wondering why I bother to curate Youtubes like that, using one social medium to access another.\u00a0 Think of stamp collecting.\u00a0 The latest series had to do with rebuilding Aleppo, the grand mosque there.\n\nChalk it up [to cyber tourism](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2018/07/cyber-tourism.html) and wanting to \"go there\" with my friends.\u00a0 This blog or journal was designed as the log book for a crew on the road, doing useful stuff like helping rebuild Aleppo.\u00a0 Crews want to look back and tell their kids what they helped rebuild.\n\nBizmos have their fans, some of whom channel them funding to catalog order this or that artifact.\u00a0 We see the transactions in the bright of day a lot of the time (bizmos leave audit trails).\u00a0 [Electrons move](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/electrons-rule-ac5f19d2996d) from here to there.\u00a0 The crew will return in a future episode to help the locals install this pump.\u00a0 Hospitals get stocked this way too.\u00a0 Schools.\n\nAt the other end:\u00a0 people in coffee shops, but maybe not that into coffee.\u00a0 I'm borrowing from romanticized Paris, where we posit existentialism was born in meme form, only to percolate through coffee shops to show up on bookshelves, further catalyzing osmosis.\n\nCSN doesn't assume \"existentialism\" is the philo du jour, yet draws in those scholarly fumes, mixed with Borges, Arabia, Alexandria.\u00a0 There's a look and feel conducive to study.\u00a0 In that atmosphere, you also have arcade games (we call them that for a reason) whereby becoming a champion may be of service to one's favorite crews in the field.\n\nA team of three is cruising from Kabul to Istanbul and stops off in Shiraz.\u00a0 Here we find some drawings by a street kid that lead us to this clutch of artists making some highly interesting models.\u00a0 This crew specializes in mathy art, ala M. C. Escher and many more.\u00a0 Think of that conference Bridges, which said [\"my\" A & B modules](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/12/incomprehensible.html) were for the birds.\u00a0 And tweeting I did:\u00a0 let's 3D print these things, Makers!\n\nActually [my art work](https://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2014/12/convergent-friends.html) was called Holding It Together in a Cyrillic language, and features six beveled faces of a cube pulled inward and held by tension on six cables to a smaller tetrahedron inside.\u00a0 No glue.\u00a0 If the faces are closed, there's a ship in a bottle feel to it.\u00a0 Tension compression.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/16140315443/in/album-72157654417641521/)\n\n\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0441\u044c!\n\nAnyway, that's the science fiction backdrop against which this journal is written.\u00a0 Then we need Control Rooms to help dispatch and coordinate the bizmos.\u00a0 This would not be efficient without the caravans and convergences.\u00a0 Health care teams can't all squeeze in one vehicle.\n\nControl Room is a sister blog, suggesting the role.\u00a0 I worked for Clackamas County in [dispatching driver fleets](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/fragment-of-day.html), an early template for the Uber model.\u00a0 People bring different experiences to the table.\n\nA lot of Africans are asking for borderless driving.\u00a0 I was negotiating with some nationalists the other day, suggesting we could have a balance of Berlin Walls and lengthy queues, versus wide open areas in which distance driving was a given, a freedom.\u00a0 No road blocks with checkers.\n\nThe thing about Africans is most were never consulted regarding the map of nations to begin with, so they're freer to start fresh with an unmarked globe, only to mark it up with other markup.\u00a0 Substance control check points, like freeway weigh stations, need not be barriers across a road.\n\nPicture a cargo container with QR-code and RFID getting off loaded in North Africa and making its way inland.\u00a0 The sensors it drives by register its progress and GPS is involved.\u00a0 People know the contents and blockchains know how to move tokens around.\n\nKeeping a cargo container on schedule factors in ample time for the driver to find this a doable lifestyle (citizen diplomats need to compare notes at truck stops, sharing news and views, for the health of the economy and Pareto optimizing).\n\nRemember drivers might hand off trucks.\u00a0 Sometimes the drivers linger, enjoying coffee shops, taking classes for credit.\u00a0 Sometimes its the truck that stays behind, on a charging station.\u00a0 No one said a driver has to drive more than five hours a day.\u00a0 Maybe some do but the rule books is flexible.\n\nIf you wanted to do some substance control, this might be the place, at the stopover, where electric tractor truck A switches its pulled container to electric tractor B.\u00a0\u00a0 Batteries may not support the long hauls characteristic of peak oil.\u00a0 Tractors queue longer as well.\u00a0 Drivers jump from rig to rig.\n\nSome Bizmo fleets work the same way.\u00a0 A lot of the customization (e.g. favorite tunes, dashboard instruments) get stored in the cloud.\u00a0 I tool around town in this mobile office charged near the airport, only to turn it in three days later.\u00a0 I'll be continuing my work in another city, taking meetings where I need them.",
