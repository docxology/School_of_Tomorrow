  "content": "What was est?\u00a0 This came up at a lunch meeting the other day, in that two of us had seen Transformation:\u00a0 The Life and Legacy of Werner Erhard.\u00a0 You can watch it for free [on Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/watch/151134).\n\nIn a nutshell, Erhard understood that our sense of integrity as human beings is very bound up in our need to be right about stuff.\u00a0 That's just obvious grammatically (in Wittgenstein's sense).\u00a0 Who wants to believe a lot of garbage and have wrong ideas about everything?\u00a0 That's not cool.\u00a0 We want to be suave, smooth, and knowing.\u00a0 Or our need to be right takes other forms.\u00a0 We'd like to have the most appropriate responses to others in need.\u00a0 It's not a \"bad thing\" to wish for integrity and to defend that one has it.\n\nUnderstanding that, the est Training provided an environment that challenged one to become unstuck, where decisions and beliefs had actually led one astray.\u00a0 That's hard to look at, let alone admit, but the genius was having someone uniformly and in blanket fashion attack all belief systems at a metaphysical level.\u00a0 Why do you suppose how you feel about something has anything to do with how things really are?\u00a0 Why do you suppose your beliefs about things have anything to do with reality?\u00a0 The trainer gives off a kind of extreme skepticism that anyone in the room really has a grip.\u00a0 It takes a strong character to make hundreds of people wrong, but if you can pull it off in the right spirit (heh), you give even the most self-confident and self-secure an occasion to really question.\u00a0 Why not?\u00a0 Everyone else is, and you're not being singled out.\u00a0 Everyone gets pretty much the same treatment.\u00a0 The trainer makes everyone wrong.\n\nThen towards the end of the training, the trainer (a different person that weekend anyway) switches sides, metaphysically speaking, and makes you right.\u00a0 Now that you've had a chance to take a look, to make choices, you get to be responsible for what you've decided to keep, to hold onto.\u00a0 That's something you've chosen now, more than something you've inherited or absorbed unexamined.\n\nOf course in two weekends it would be impossible to look at every belief, assumption, character trait in that light, so it's more a matter of internalizing the process and contacting one's trainer within, a strong mentor or coach (in archetype) who is willing for you to let go of beliefs and attitudes that no longer serve you or add to the quality of your life or to that of the people around you.\u00a0 This doesn't mean you've been defanged or rendered less dangerous.\u00a0 On the contrary, when you see yourself as freely choosing your racket / act / role in the world, you may be willing to amp it up, because you sense it's making a positive difference.\u00a0 Certainly Werner's crew was behaving that way and I didn't blame them.\u00a0 They were on to something.",
