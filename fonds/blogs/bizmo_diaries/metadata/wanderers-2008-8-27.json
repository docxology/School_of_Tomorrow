  "content": "All but two of us have laptops this morning, eight around the table.  This was my first group check-in since starting a [Wanderers PbWiki](http://wanderers.pbwiki.com/), leading me to make some administrative changes.I hadn't realized my Writers were all being notified of one another's changes, the default, leading to lots of new emails.

The topic of buffalo herds also figured prominently, their effects on topography, also migrating tarantulas, Glenn corroborating some of [Ron Baithwaite's](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/2730209130/in/set-72157606528267245/) scary campfire tales.We also continued our discussion of my [Ouija board model](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/08/elitism.html) vs. simple minded conspiracy theories, with Jon having us imagine a giant planchette governed by huge numbers of people.[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhrXoGRfJeHWsQ5cUGHkGcaKBEk0uG7RDFx9m_HIqDVHjORuBno7R0WZE9BONi6Yq27XdTCO2SbiPhRhNucfIh-NB5XczqTD6JMbtU1aFYvWaTYO8GD5zSvyDP6KJW0yx2k8dAj/s1600-h/planchette.jpeg)",
