  "content": "Books for kids that I read, by Enid Blyton for example, would glorify meal time, and give detailed descriptions of dishes, which could be enjoyed by an imaginative reader.\u00a0 Not just visualizations were important.\u00a0 Not being a budding gourmet, I might get impatient with some of these passages, but at least I was reading them.\u00a0 Nowadays people get impatient with reading itself more quickly, and lingering over a description of a food is itself an acquired tasted.\u00a0 Like Enid Blyton novels.\n\nLots of press for Alaska lately.\u00a0 Allen could have shaken me by the shoulders in the movie version, where everyone's a caricature of themselves.\u00a0 He's really quite low key.\u00a0 We'd been thinking of doing a cruise to Alaska with dad when then 2000 accident happened.\u00a0 \"Just take a bag\" he said, \"too late to book a cabin.\"\u00a0 He's talking about the multi-stop inside passage ferry, where you get on and get off. Not enough bandwidth I'm thinking.\u00a0 But I like the sound of seeing glaciers again.\n\nThanks to Mr. Blake for introducing my to Tumblr, through which I found [the Hexagonal Awareness Project](http://hexagonalawarenessproject.tumblr.com/).\u00a0 Now that's a project after my own heart, dovetailing neatly with HP4E, Hexapents for Everyone.\u00a0 The \"for everyone\" trope, with a \"4E\" is not my intention.\u00a0 James Joyce had \"Here Comes Everyone\" (HCE), which I'd quote a lot, in my \"human centers environment\" writings, and then Guido came along with CP4E with DARPA funding, how cool was that.\u00a0 Just for IDLE though, nothing all that sinister.\u00a0 I got lots of mileage from IDLE, especially with Akbar font, as you'll find through these blogs (such as fragments exist).\n\n[The HexaPent](http://hexagonalawarenessproject.tumblr.com/post/40532961284) is well expressed as a spherical object, the soccerball most easily, which is also the pattern for C60, the \"buckminsterfullerene\" molecule (\"fullerenes\" the family).\n\nRomanticizing certain meats, as delicacies, praising their virtues.\u00a0 It's as if the cow life, soft and certain until a sudden end, were so popular with spirit world that we were seduced and enticed, as predators, to crave bovines, so that more and more could be made upon this Earth, and so it was.\u00a0 Bucky used to talk as if metals themselves had a voice and lobbied congress.\u00a0 In language, the nonhumans criss-cross, make waves, with ergotic egoid eddies bobbing in the way.\u00a0 The diets talk, share the carrots not their sticks.\u00a0 \"Raw vegan magic\" sings Lindsey, a good siren for the genre, my pleasure to shipwreck so nearby, in the arms of some steak.\n\nAt the Bagdad the other night, the comedians were deep into food humor.\u00a0 I honestly don't think the guy going on about bacon-wrapped chicken wings knew of our pepto-bizmol colored bacon-flavored beer, made by Rogue for a donut company named Voodoo.\u00a0 Hard to top those economics.",
