  "content": "In this science fiction drama, the Canadians have turned sufficiently into an extension of District groupthink to be counted on to round up and return the \"defectors\" who try to draft dodge.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn the meantime, those Mexican countries (wink) with their leftist governments, provide a haven south of the border for those wishing to avoid being sent to the front, as pawns for NATO.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nIn that case, the border wall was a good investment.\u00a0 It was always about keeping the prey hemmed in, in our game park.\u00a0 We've been here before, in screenplays and dramas.\n\nA sealed border is an affront to the freedom of movement for everyone, whereas most borders are semi-permeable -- meaning permeable.\u00a0 Some of the right stuff, and right people, still gets through.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWho are the right people with the right stuff?\u00a0 That's up to the ones controlling customs.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThese read like grammatical truisms.\u00a0 The fabled Hermetic Seal is more myth than physics, akin to a \"perfect vacuum\".\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMost membranes are at least permeable to light, meaning any electromagnetic frequency on the spectrum.\n\nThe question of citizenship or ships is not always a question of geographic locale.\u00a0 You'll find citizens of country B inside country A and vice versa.\u00a0 People mix it up like that, all the time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhen an ideology puts people first, such complicated arrangements pose less of a threat.\u00a0 From the viewpoint of the individual, it's rarely that complicated.\u00a0 One cultivates one's loyalties as events unfold. Each step of the way makes sense, like a blockchain.\n\nThe idea that a person born anywhere on the planet has some inherent right of access to the whole planet, is not accepted even in principle as a part of the UN Declaration on Human Rights.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe rights of citizenship, if one has citizenship, are not the same as access rights.\u00a0 Thanks to private property rights, no one alive has unrestricted access in practice.\u00a0 Even if \"some inherent right\" pertains, we see countervailing principles.\u00a0 Then there's simply the inaccessibility of much of the planet.\u00a0 No roads...\n\nI'll be the first to admit I have no privileged access to most places.\u00a0 Given my expired passport (I need to work on that), I'm pretty well penned in, but within a rather large area.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWhat's oppressive is when the borders you must not cross keep you within a single campus or less.\u00a0 Such arrangements are usually considered punitive, although if you're washed ashore at sea, on a deserted yet life supportive environment, then you may consider yourself lucky to be alive.\u00a0 Hello Tom Hanks.\n\nOne hopes for at least an airport or dock, with appropriate boardable vessels coming and going.",
