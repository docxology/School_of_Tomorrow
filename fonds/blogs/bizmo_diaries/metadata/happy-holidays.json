I was on a family call earlier.\n\nJuly 5 is of course X-Day, big on the Subgenius calendar, and is my sister's birthday.\u00a0 On X-Day, the cult members pray to be abducted by the flying saucers. When that doesn't happen, there's a ritualistic explanation, in terms of misinterpreted scripture. Great excuse for a picnic, but this year it's a virtual picnic.\n\nAnd then, there's Christmas in July.\u00a0 Long time readers of this blog know about my [\"king who came late\" mythology](https://worldgame.blogspot.com/2008/01/christmas-folk-lore.html). He has a name now: Mitra. He's a Friend in some way.\u00a0 The other three kings have come and gone. What gift hath this new king brought?\n\nThe Xmas in July meme has been blatant about its commercialism from the beginning. The Santa Hat is Mithraic in origin as is as the Statue of Liberty crown and torch (like Columbia's). You may see where I'm going with this:\u00a0 [Quakers](https://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2020/06/studying-mithraism.html) venture back into business (\"feel their oats\" as we say).\n\nNot that they ever left entirely.\u00a0 However the book Quakernomics makes clear that Quakers enjoyed something of [an economic heyday](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-quaker-arc.html) in the age of early industrialization by means of steam and steal, electricity would come later.\n\nQuakers had been a persecuted minority but were now enjoying their reputation for business integrity.\u00a0 Lots of companies gave themselves a Quaker spin. Barclay's Bank. Lloyds of London. Cadbury... Nowadays Pepsi carries the banner forward, with the oats guy.\n\nI'm not suggesting there's some way to make history repeat, only that Christmas in July is an opportunity to shape not just a specific date, but a season, almost an ethos.\u00a0 I'm looking forward to more commercials that capitalize on this idea, although I know I won't become a fan of all of them.\n\nBack to Subgenius, no I haven't seen the new Kickstarter funded movie. I know it's out and has been in theaters, and I've seen a trailer. My guru Rev. Onan Canobite has traveled I believe to Austin, TX for an opening. This was all pre covid of course.\n\nWe're on lockdown protocol per company orders and if I do anything it'll be from a social distance. However that's not as dire as it sounds. I have a small patch of land, big enough to accept delivery of another 92 C6XTY balls, with the expectation of doing a 3-frequency this time (I have a 2-frequency 42 baller already assembled in the staging area).\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/15475612525/in/photolist-pzwyrB)\n\n::\u00a0[Quakernomics Talk](https://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/10/a-quaker-arc.html), Linus Pauling House, 2014 ::",
