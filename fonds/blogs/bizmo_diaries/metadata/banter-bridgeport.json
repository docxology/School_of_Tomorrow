  "content": "I was catching up with an old pal this evening, when I ran into a fellow Wanderer, killing time waiting for a nearby event to get going.She joined us at our booth for some sophisticated conversation about Jungians versus Freudians, whether either still had career potential (\"do they still make new ones?\" I heard myself asking).I used to carry around books by \"[Frood](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/01/what-shall-i-do.html)\" as a kid (didn't know how to pronounce it -- still don't read German).That was toward the end of my day.At the very outset, Derek swung by, in search of [Fry's ads](http://www.fyelectronic.com/).  We both exulted at the low cost of Flash memory.  \"The laptops we're handing out in [Darfur](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2007/08/darfur.html) and such are all Flash, no hard drive\" was my cheery news -- except we don't really have any really big shipments to Darfur yet, owing to whatever (I don't claim to know all the details, rely on journalists to fill me in).Later, I was contacted by some cool NGO in Colorado or someplace about hooking in more with World Game.  I always cite [the map](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/map/dymax.html) in such cases (this wasn't my first conversation along these lines, although I've sensed a real up tick in quality over the years (yes, some of these next gen types have really been doing their homework)).",
