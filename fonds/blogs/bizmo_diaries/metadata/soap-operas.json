  "content": "I just got off the phone with Maureen of Lake Oswego, having gotten all melodramatic, getting stentorian, while telling her melodrama was not my style, enough with the goodies and baddies already!\u00a0 My impatience comes in waves, as I think is true with many of us, nor am I saying impatience is always a bad thing, on the contrary.\n\nSpeaking of soap operas, Don Wardwell was by today, in the wake of Glenn's stuff reshuffling in an orderly fashion (hi Barbara), and he told me the story of a guy he knew who was hoping to get a friend of his to move in with him.\u00a0 He'd stormed out of the Pauling House when Don suggested his desire to discuss this move publicly might be inappropriate.\u00a0 That guy was supposedly me.\u00a0 You say she'd been a Jehovah's Witness, that I was smitten somehow?\n\nOne reason I doubt the story is it so closely matches what actually did happen:\u00a0 at the height of my Food Not Bombs activity, around Occupy, I shared my house with three women (how I think of them, fairly), all of whom I still know and keep track of.\u00a0 They're blog characters, you can go back and look.\u00a0 We were in synergy in some ways, and no, it wasn't a harem situation, gosh darn.\u00a0 More Charlie's Angels?\u00a0 We're talking soaps after all.\n\nAnyway, I'll go back and check the timeline.\u00a0 A don't doubt this new angel actually existed, I just don't remember Glenn talking me out of it, or the Pauling House episode (back to Don's recollection).\u00a0 Apparently my erratic behavior had no consequences this time, as no such creature moved in.\n\nHere's what I think:\u00a0 especially older people, but really young people too, are prone to develop \"like I was there\" memories, vivid, sharp, of contrary-to-fact scenarios.\u00a0 Day care centers get shut down over this kind of stuff, and probably nursing homes too for that matter (I'm in neither business).\n\nSorry everyone, if I'm the one turning into a leaky bucket, letting important memories fade away.\u00a0 I pride myself on having a good memory, as Suzanne might remember.\u00a0 These blogs (Quaker journals) help a lot.",
