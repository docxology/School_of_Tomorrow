The others came home later, shared tea with me in the kitchen.We shared milk with the pets this morning, which seems extravagant, what was left in a cereal bowl.  The bread was a cut above too.  TV channels all blue still, since DirecTV pulled the plug.  Have DVD and like that.  Maybe a new sponsor will come along.Let them sleep in.  I've got work in my inbox, might get some R&R down the road.",
