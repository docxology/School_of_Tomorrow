[http://tinyurl.com/849vaos](http://tinyurl.com/849vaos)\n\nHope to see you there!\n\nDon\nI tried to get a word in edgewise, but we've got a full house and lots of people with stuff to say.  Fortunately, I have my blogs and am happy to resort to asynchronous commentary.  My new self-discipline is to only answer when asked (one of Fuller's too as I recall).\n\nI'm fairly optimistic that Judaism has made good enough friends in Asia, among Buddhists especially, that there's really no danger of another upwelling of classic Hitlerism or one of those.\u00a0 When it comes to highly literate, scholarly cultures that control lots of assets, the Jews are not alone.\n\nHow much total fissile material do we need for nuclear medicines and so on?\u00a0 This is a side conversation I'm trying to have while blogging at the same time.\u00a0 I assume Iran is aiming for the medical market big time.\u00a0 A [Japanese version](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2009/02/outreach-to-japan.html) of Global Data might have some figures (Japan has a lot of interest in health care).\n\nThe conversation has somewhat gone off the rails, but that's OK.\u00a0 Wanderers are known for their meandering style.\u00a0 Google Drones?\u00a0 Lots of interesting chatter.\u00a0 Some visitors here tonight, not just the usual crew.\n\nLindsey and I walked up [to Belmont](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3182545429/) earlier today, as I made good on a belated birthday gift to get her some lenses, based on [an up-to-date eye exam](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/industrial-scale.html).\u00a0 She lost her specs shortly after we met and has been doing without.\u00a0 As she ventures forth into the world, those lenses might come in useful.\n\nWhat I'm interested in knowing is whether Marianne has as high an opinion of Chaim Potok's writing as I do.\u00a0 The Chosen was a big influence on me, helped get me into Freud and psychoanalysis as a future discipline, with the move to philosophy in the 1970s (there's a lot of shared lineage, through the Vienna Circle and Frankfurt School, to name a couple relevant switchboards).\n\nYes, I checked out [Portnoy's Complaint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portnoy%27s_Complaint) but wasn't that big a fan.\u00a0 [Woody Allen](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/05/flash-back.html) fits in here somewhere.\n\nWe had snow on the ground this morning.\u00a0 Portland is definitely in a different bioregion than Santa Clara.\n\nLew us here.\u00a0 He'd been to the Quaker Men's Group.\u00a0 I've gone in years past.\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/6849185908/)",
