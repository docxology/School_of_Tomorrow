I had to toss my original default Anaconda out the window and do a clean install, good exercise, but not how I'd anticipated events flowing.\n\nFollowing best practice, I'm now installing a geopandas in its own environment.\u00a0 But do I have the repo issue sorted out?\u00a0 After this fresh install from the Anaconda website, I went [Warning:\u00a0 don't do this, read on!]:\n\n$ conda create --name geopandas python=3.6 geopandas\n\nleaving it entirely up to conda to decide which repo I meant.\u00a0 Even I don't know, but there's Fiona and all the rest, so I know I'm getting some gigabytes.\n\nUpgrading the Anaconda navigator (in process) will give it a chance to see the new environment I just created.\u00a0 Will geopandas import successfully this time, or crap out in Fiona?\u00a0 That is the question.\n\nWe're going from Anaconda 1.7.0 to 1.8.5 -- OK, done, lets see if we have a new environment, yes I do, and I don't even have Spyder 3.2.8 yet, in the new one.\u00a0 I'll go out to the command line, activate the new environment, boot python, and see if the import works, take a screenshot...\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi2SrBE1JhMpLE2gzF_A3iu2OUnPXbeJeMsPTOfKd59tdT9cvfPNvvRdkK7SOp5VCHX0giBLR0CffukgkPOcUsv75ahAX8PX6s1zyn8vIUJ2KSI1z20fGntBtIJ0YIKKKXVJMcc/s1600/conda_activate_oops.tiff)\nNot so fast, say the conda gods. I still have PATH issues.\u00a0 Fight, fight, fight!\u00a0 \"Fighting Quakers\" is a meme, cite Earlham College, also Franklin High School here in Portland, just blocks away.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/27153082297/in/photolist-HnqDnk-F7Udph-pxkvi7-axj4op/)\n\nHowever Franklin High School recently\u00a0[dropped the Fighting Quaker mascot](http://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/national/article211108734.html) recently using the rationale of not wanting to offend Friends.\n\nFriends I know were forgiving as it's true Ben Franklin never overtly tied himself through membership to any Meeting, that we're able to find the record of.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhoQm7feCJrl-wxNKihZkNacxD27nUk28VtiYR-0VHkROLoa7Bcad4XRwUnM5TJfOsT1kyRqTVEk-wyJTfbewILmwsdTcis8UryBP6fuKttwJ6i3dGjg-3GBPgArTY8ohma_Owh/s1600/geopandas_waste_of_time_2018.jpg)\n\nSo no, even with a clean environment, without a force to conda-forge as the repo, don't expect a working geopandas.\u00a0 Fortunately, there's a one liner to wipe an Environment.\u00a0 I'll do that, after some coffee (looks like a late nighter), then do a conda install of geopandas with conda-forge the forced repo.\u00a0 Can one set a default repo [per each Environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html)?\n\nSkipped the coffee, [bashed on](https://conda.io/docs/commands/env/conda-env-remove.html).\u00a0 Then took a break.\n\nGood thing I did as the pinto beans were done, just in time to turn off the crockpot.\u00a0 Reheat some coffee in the microwave.\u00a0 So where are we?\n\nNavigator sees its environment is gone.\u00a0 I'll recreate geopandas and then install with a -c conda-forge, meaning I specify the channel and don't leave it up to conda to decide.\u00a0 Will that go any better?\u00a0 Lets find out:\n\nconda create -n geopandas python=3.6 geopandas -c conda-forge\n\nThat gets me:\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj48Na9drlJOPBZ44cGT1ICsHnhl6GtmaCYQoscIurQGCcc7IdY_fK97mnveuRjB-mwAjY9xPdgYvgX5ATPY3MtLCMqbbwjCmKVZYNl15pevUk0GCHQDGlcre91U4LBZPSgkNfe/s1600/conda-forge-install-geopandas.tiff)\n\nThat's looking promising.\u00a0 Will fiona slay me again?\u00a0 Lets proceed.\n\nThanks to the way operating systems facilitate multitasking, I'm able to turn my attention to other matters.\n\nEarlier today, the FBI was asking small business owners in the USSA ([inside joke](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2017/02/rabble-babble.html)) to at least reboot their routers if not install actual firmware.\u00a0 The Disney Parental Circle option has been added for the Netgear R7000, I discovered, upon fully complying.\n\nDon't question Big Brother, right?\u00a0 I'm sure many Russians will be equally interested in obeying, as no one wants malware on their routers, whatever the source.\u00a0 Here's a screen shot.\n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzEwFhZuZ5ni9fNJ7v8xiQm0LT0VDc-w7JCoxoolMCRIvjxXgq6wEwAMwoSOWAxhSOpdI_mz67UaJD6DMVJOr_drVYFtATQWhe3mY6gj_6jJQS2TVZkTmQ1LhiLOqjp79hxLbj/s1600/netgear_parental_circle.tiff)\n\nThat's after hacking in to the Netgear on 192.168.0.1 I think it was, which is actually the router behind the router facing the public internet.\n\nThis all came after my exploring the geopandas possibility earlier this Saturday.\u00a0 Yes I often work on the weekends, entrepreneur that I am.\u00a0 Do I keep the sabbath?\u00a0 I'd welcome a conversation with rabbis about that sometime.\u00a0 Netiquette has a lot in common with Jewish law?\u00a0 I'm not the authority.\n\nI'm still installing in another process.\u00a0 We've put a lot of hours into spatial data management today, what with the summit meeting in Cedarhurst.\u00a0 I should update the CTO.\u00a0 Damn, too much on my plate!\n\nI'm gonna get another bowl of beans and salsa and write to the NetDispenser group.\u00a0 That's open source and uses the Raspberry Pi as a router, which is what I want to ask about.\u00a0 I'll check on my geopandas experiment in awhile.\n\nAll right!\u00a0 I document my success with the top screen shot.\u00a0 A -c conda-forge on the end kept the Environment integral.\u00a0 Compatibility was achieved!",
