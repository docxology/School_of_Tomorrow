It's an archetype, part of our yearning to overcome.\n\nSpeaking of \"overcoming\", I don't like singing We Shall Overcome anymore (a favorite in the liberal hymnal).\u00a0 As a kid it made sense, but I'm 58 now, so either I did or I didn't.\u00a0 Deadlines make sense.\u00a0 Using the future tense at this point sounds phony.\n\nJohn Taylor, visiting from Indonesia, was at the house when I got home.\u00a0 I had those new USB memory sticks ready, one for each of us.\u00a0 He's writing his autobio.\n\nI showed him the Word docs inside Office Libre, on a Pi.\u00a0 Checking at Fred Meyer's today, they've removed all the Linux-specific magazines.\u00a0 The dumbing down campaign takes a toll every summer.\u00a0 The idiocracy always find new ways to oppress the geeks (freaks), like by taking away their reading materials.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/28330138903/in/dateposted-public/)",
