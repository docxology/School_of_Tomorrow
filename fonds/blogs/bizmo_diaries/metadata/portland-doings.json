  "content": "Carol is being recorded downstairs, where I've cleared out of the living room.\u00a0 I've been camping out in the [Steve Holden Chair of Computer Science](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2015/09/another-study-period.html), keeping the dog company while I [promulgate Martian Math](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/10/martian-math-storyboards.html).\n\nToday I have lunch with some friends.\u00a0 This morning:\u00a0 my walk, meeting up with Glenn.\n\nIn case of a major earthquake, we can expect liquefaction of the muck under the fuel depots along Hwy 30, west side.\u00a0 The heavy equipment is mostly in SE.\u00a0 If the bridges fail, we'll be in trouble.\u00a0 Fortunately we have one of the best gravity fed water systems on the East Side.\n\nOh wait, they're planning to disconnect that and make us dependent on electricity.\u00a0 The best earthquake backup system is to be purposely disabled by \"city fathers\".\u00a0 As Glenn put it, Portland is built atop ignorance.\u00a0 Just look at those homes on stilts in the West Hills.\u00a0 He wrote about all this in the Southeast Examiner.\n\nI've been debating Vote By Mail with a former PSF elections maestro, still [active in e-Voting](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/05/voting-machines.html).\u00a0 My concluding comment:\n\nSome N8V reservations e.g. Warm Springs, have only one post box in a radius of 40 miles. Getting to a \"polling place\" (USPO) is well nigh impractical (there's no home pick up or delivery on the rez) but then \"as a zip code\" the N8Vs know they'll continue to be punished regardless, as that's the white man's way, i.e. their votes count for nil as it is. \n\nWhen it comes to fairness, I think that's as scarce as [ U-235 or whatever ] i.e. there's not much of it in human affairs, never has been, but \ndemocratic models do help us remember it as a liberal value.  Thinking about \"free and fair elections\" helps us create more fairness, even if \nwe have yet to have a national election, in the US at least, that would truly count as either.\n\nIt's easy to judge in hindsight right?\u00a0 No election was fair when blacks couldn't vote.\u00a0 No election was fair when women couldn't vote.\n\nSince those two prohibitions were rolled back to some degree, other barriers to voting have crept in, and if blocking voting doesn't turn the tide, there's always rigging and miss-counting.\n\nWe need a lengthy documentary series on the history of voting and democracy, don't we?\u00a0 An [old theme](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2004/09/regarding-usa-public-schools.html) in these blogs.\n\nThe Mayor, Charlie Hale, has decided to not run again and instead focus on strategy.\u00a0 He's right that many key decisions need to be made during the remainder of his term.\u00a0 He sounded in full possession of his faculties on NPR the other day, quoting Monty Python a few times.\n\nNPR is reassuring us that even though they didn't pick Boeing for the latest boondoggle, the Pentagon is still engaged in prime contractor irrigating in our region, per usual.\u00a0 They spin that as \"good news\" somehow, not sure how.\u00a0 Jobs I guess?\u00a0\u00a0 Is that a bribe?\n\nCertainly it's not about keeping our edge in engineering as the military is prohibited from accessing our best science (any military, except when it comes to health care for the injured) -- a truism, as the best science is not about killingry (duh).\n\nWe were hearing [on the radio yesterday](http://www.npr.org/2015/10/28/451146230/missed-treatment-soldiers-with-mental-health-issues-dismissed-for-misconduct), about how the US discards its own soldiers left and right.\u00a0 One DUI and you're discharged, without honors, denied benefits, after sometimes decades of service, and even if you have injuries (especially if you have injuries). \n\nHuman resources are treated like so much garbage, collateral damage, so the war machine can afford to keep running.\u00a0 Use 'em up and spit 'em out.\u00a0 America eats its young.\u00a0 \"The true costs must never be admitted let alone paid\" is the business model.\n\nLike the Taliban, the US Army vets could use more professional, less backward, [outside medical services](http://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-of-men-and-war-1201187762/), like from Doctors Without Borders.\u00a0 The secret tape recordings of Army psychiatrists prove they harbor and protect quacks, a kind of terrorist.\n\nThe leadership provided by Judeo-Islamo-Christian cultures is somewhat pitiful isn't it, witness the Middle East.\u00a0 All they know how to do is fight, right?\u00a0 The Middle East is hardly a poster child for the so-called \"prophetic\" religions.\u00a0 New Yorkers are more law abiding.\u00a0 [Bishop Tutu](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-for-reconciliation.html) made this point.\n\nWe already knew that about quacks in psychiatry from the torture-authorizing BS artists in the civilian rank and file.\u00a0 That whole branch of the medical profession (psychiatry) is fighting for respectability at this point, given it can't seem to disown its own bad apples.\n\nIn Asylum District, \"crazy\" as in \"bat-shit crazy\" is becoming a badge of honor almost.\u00a0 What they call \"sanity\" in military doctrine never seems to set much of a standard.\u00a0 Helicopter gunships get involved, and sanity is out the window, once again.\u00a0 I'm glad the Pacific Northwest makes other investments.\n\nAt lunch we talked about Heidegger quite a bit.\u00a0 I went home resolved to Google up something interesting.\u00a0 I liked Richard Rorty's summary at the end of this BBC documentary (above).\u00a0 He, along with Walter Kaufmann, were two of my teachers at Princeton.\u00a0 Rorty actually read my thesis.\u00a0 This documentary [on Ho Chi Minh](https://youtu.be/IHv3nQovuik) was interesting too.",
