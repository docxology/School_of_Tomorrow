  "content": "The news says NATO is about to give itself permission to amp up its invasion of the Russian homeland. The idea is to keep Ukraine out of NATO on technicalities but \u201cfor all intents and purposes\u201d to use it as a military base, as had been happening under President Blinken and Vice President Nuland for some time now.\u00a0\n\nWait, did I get the narrative wrong? Anyway, it\u2019s time for NATO to get the show on the road.\n\nBack in knee jerk legacy media land, there\u2019s probably some sense that people are following the action and are ready to jump into their roles as nationalist loyalist troopers, happy to march march march like the old people tell \u2018em is necessary.\u00a0\n\nThe NATO geezers expect the allegiance of a younger generation not necessarily cut out to play hero in such a tawdry low class drama. Who wants to die for the knuckle draggers? \u201cWhy let those dinos live through me?\u201d your average coder is thinking. \u201cThey don\u2019t even know Python, most of \u2018em (OK, Ada maybe).\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t think of anything more uncool than living in Virginia with parents slaved to Beltway Mafia politics. What an ugly childhood for so many. Shades of Laurel Canyon right? It\u2019s the kids of privilege, like Washington and Jefferson, who are more likely to rebel against the parent company (East India in their case). The Doors.\n\nThe frenzied media, MSNBC especially, need to do way more to whip up Russophobia (aka dementia russogenica). Rachel Maddow, help us out here. The needle hasn\u2019t really budged in a while, as attention turns to the \u201cstates are no solution\u201d drama in the so-called \u201cMiddle East\u201d (snicker). Is it time for another novychok bedtime story? What airplane is parked next to what airplane?\n\nPresident Blinken needs to deliver some great oratory, before people forget the plot again. Help us remember how democracy is at stake. Tell us how authoritarians will never get a toehold in the USA at least. These people are just not psychologically ready yet. Not for Mafia brand theater. More snake oil kool-aid is needed. Pass the numbskull sauce.\n\nLet me help y\u2019all out. Um.. um.. \u201cMy fellow Americans\u2026\u201d. Something like that. And knock it off with the Zionista thing, that\u2019s too radical for our middle of the roaders (pet lovers, cat ladies) by several orders of magnitude. No one thinks that\u2019s cool anymore. Let the Brits take over that whole show. You know, the guys who started it. Lawrence of Arabia and all that.",
