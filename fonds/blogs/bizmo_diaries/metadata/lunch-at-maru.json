  "content": "[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/9844179825/)\n\nMom and I were agreeing, over Japanese fare, that now was a fine time to be confessing how few and far between had been any diplomatic contacts between Tehran and Washington, DC, since the Shah was deposed, and yet we were already up to bombing again (Syria this time) [a few days ago](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/09/failures-in-logic.html), from zero to sixty.\n\nMilitary action is supposed to be a last resort after all diplomacy has failed but here is evidence of not even trying.\u00a0 When diplomacy breaks down is when you need a flurry of diplomacy, or have US colleges and universities completely dropped the ball in teaching this stuff.\u00a0 Has Woodrow Wilson School been replaced by West Point, when it comes to how conflicts should be handled?\u00a0 May the historians investigate. \n\nIf John Kerry derailed the attack for the time being, he was just doing his job.\u00a0 Diplomats should avert wars as a matter of course.\u00a0 State should steal all the business, all the limelight, from the Pentagon from now on.\u00a0 We don't want, need or care about the Cruise Missile Porn, generals on TV with their model jets, stroking their smooth lines, slobbering over the mayhem they're about to unleash [on CNN](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/08/chicago.html). \n[](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/03/argo-movie-review.html)\n[Talk to Hollywood](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/03/argo-movie-review.html) about that if that's your kinky complex.\u00a0 Get your own Adult Movies studio.\n\nWe talked about Citizens Diplomacy or \"second track\", which in years gone by State has advocated.\u00a0 Whatever happened to Citizens' Diplomacy?\n\nIt's just they're so rusty at diplomacy over there in the State Department -- overworked at the top, feckless around the middle -- that any talk of a \"second track\" immediately sounds threatening, potentially disruptive to one's career. \n\nLike when the amateur athlete presumes to challenge the reigning champ.\u00a0 The champ just hasn't been working out lately.\u00a0 The smell of \"rout\" is in the air.\u00a0 State is ashamed to take its shirt off and reveal there's nothing there and/or a lot of flab.\u00a0 Been letting the military fight your [dirty wars](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/07/dirty-wars-movie-review.html) eh?\u00a0 Nice vacation?\n\nWe have [lots of Iranians](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/08/iranian-festival.html) in Portland, including a family I interviewed for Princeton, one of many.\u00a0 We're talking intelligent professionals with satellite TV, lots of skills, highly personable.\u00a0 If DC is too quick on the draw to reach for the cruise missiles, even before deigning to pick up a cell phone, then maybe we should help those poor slobs out, so desperately out of shape they've become?\n\n\"DC, you have three years to get back up to steam, in the meantime Portland will assume all your diplomatic responsibilities, free of charge, simply to save our own skins and build up tourism\".\u00a0 Sounds like a generous proposition.\u00a0 We'll give 'em four years if they can't hack it.\n\nSo, hey, Iran, whaddya wanna talk about?\u00a0 You wanna go back to calling it Persia and stop caring about old Anglo maps with [stupid countries](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/07/pr-for-pl.html)?\u00a0 Yeah, that sounds like a conversation, we've been thinking that too.\u00a0 Greetings from Cascadia.\u00a0 How's the weather?",
