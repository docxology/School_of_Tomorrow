I've upgraded my existing blog templates, plus launched a new blog.There's some focus on Afghanistan in [my writings](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/12/charlie-wilsons-war-movie-review.html), given I'm [a buckaneer](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2006/08/buckaneers.html), and given the stories in Critical Path, Fuller's work for the Expo in Kabul.The Russians were so impressed by the 200-ft. diameter dome at the 1959 U.S. exhibit in Moscow that they bought it. \u201cMr. J. Buckingham Fuller must come to Russia and teach our engineers,\u201d garbled [Premier Khrushchev](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/u2.html). [[BFI link](http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/biography/dymaxion-american)]In today's news, there's [a non-NATO military base](http://www.manas.afcent.af.mil/) in Kyrgystan getting [put on the chopping block](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/asia/06kstan.html).  I wondered if there'd be any TV coverage but so far it's just a lot of [wire service chatter](http://in.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idINISL39109820090120), plus (somewhat amazingly) [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manas_Air_Base) is already tracking the story (an encyclopedia as a source for breaking news -- not your grandmother's Britannica eh?).So where on Earth is Kyrgystan you ask?  Google Maps to the rescue.Being able to embed Google Maps right in my blog is a cool feature.  Again, Fuller wrote a lot about the ongoing omnitriangulation projec[t](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/01/quick-recap.html), getting all that global data neatly packaged in a sharable format.Google Earth has done a good job of making global data accessible to our Global U students and faculties, looking forward to more.[As a Friend](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/04/london-knowledge-lab.html), I'm naturally committed to [civilian applications](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/01/omnitriangulating.html) of these technologies, [including in Afghanistan](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/02/synergetics-in-afghanistan.html).  I know the military is sometimes frustrated when tasked with nation building.  \"[Building Valhalla](http://washingtonindependent.com/27596/gates-aghans-not-just-troops-needed-to-win-war)\" is not part of its job description.Update 2010:  Russians gave a green light to keeping that Transit Center going, after a significant rent hike.
