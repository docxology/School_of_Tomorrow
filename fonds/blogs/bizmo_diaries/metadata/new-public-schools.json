Or are all the non-charter public schools that we'll ever have, right now with us today?\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/29934532873/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nSuppose a small city had ten golden keys, surrounding counties a few more, and it was up to school boards to award these to eligible grantees.\u00a0 You could hold a key for thirty years, then it went back in the pool.\u00a0 You'd have your school.\n\nSchools are not the same thing as school buildings.\u00a0 Any skyscraper in downtown Portland could host a school, and many do.\u00a0 Code schools in some cases.\u00a0 A university system might have the ten keys for code school endeavors.\u00a0 Some code schools could be public, labeled either magnet or vocational.\n\nThe thirty year timeout interval was arbitrary, used to introduce an idea:\u00a0 that schools could be made mortal right out of the box, and that their mortality is a good thing, a feature to be welcomed.\u00a0 What a concept, right? \n\nA broadcasting license doesn't last forever either.\u00a0 Some licenses need to be renewed.\u00a0 If we posit a relatively stable population for our model City and want to give people in every generation the opportunity to create schools, then a time-out for existing schools makes sense.\n\nAs a popular teacher in school X, not taking new students four years out, a high school winding down, I might be in on the planning of the next one.\u00a0 The \"blank canvas\" feel, the innovative talents unleashed, are welcomed.\n\nWe're not mourning for the fading of twilight schools. Having had a good run, we welcome change. We learn from every generation's mistakes, or certainly hope to.\u00a0 Honesty about what those mistakes were is part of the process, nothing to do with shame or blame.\n\nBesides, a given school might standardize on something \"retro\", allowing thematic echoes of prior times.\u00a0 Academia in the West tends to echo Greek and Roman patterns, and that's just the beginning.\u00a0 In a city like Portland, West meets East.\n\nIn other words, there's plenty of thematic continuity irrespective of specific institutions, as well as opportunities to experiment with new and positively synergetic blends.\n\nIn this possible future, new public schools are simply that, neither \"charter\" nor \"alternative\" just of more recent vintage, like a car more recently off the assembly line.\n\n\"We don't make those anymore.\"\u00a0 What a relief in some cases, right?\u00a0 With more hard won experience, we have a right to expect some improvement.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30480192581/in/dateposted-public/)",
