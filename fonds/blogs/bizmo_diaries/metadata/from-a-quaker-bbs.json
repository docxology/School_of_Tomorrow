  "content": ":: \"guilty dog\" compilation ::\n\n[](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profile/KirbyUrner)\u00a0Comment by Kirby Urner yesterday [on QuakerQuaker](http://www.quakerquaker.org/profiles/blogs/is-religion-motivated-by-guilt-trip), one typo fixed, links added:\n\nI suppose a starting point\n is to what extent do we think guilt is built-in chemically, like a \nhormone, versus cultivated as an institution, a complex social practice,\n like a game.\u00a0 I know people like to post Youtubes of \"dogs looking \nguilty\" however I sense some projection.\u00a0 I'd say the basis for guilt is\n in mammal behavior but full-blown guilt is reserved for those with \nsignificant linguistic abilities.\n\nIn Nietzsche's code of ethics, any grudge-keeping, ax-grinding or \nresentment of any kind within oneself, is a troubling sign of mental \nweakness, a loss in personal power, a kind of retardation.\u00a0 So in Will to Power\u00a0and\n other works, the aphorisms and meditations are geared towards stamping \nout such things, as too base for a true\u00a0\u00dcbermensch or whatever.\n\nThis [code of ethics](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/01/techno-morality-linus-pauling-memorial.html) later surfaces in the San Francisco-based \"est \nTraining\" wherein trainees were sternly warned against any \"putting up \nwith\" or \"trying to change\".\u00a0 Guilt came in for a drubbing as \nsomething slavers used to deter our exercise of true freedoms -- \nsomething like that (I went through a few of these est Trainings in the \nlate 70s, early 80s, including with overseer responsibilities as a \nCenters Network volunteer -- like with Quakers! -- but each one was \ndifferent; it's called The Forum today ([Landmark Corporation](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2015/08/at-landmark-event.html))).",
