Journalists are always welcome, and many will take cheap shots, as the faculty learns the ropes.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nMuch needs to be invented.\u00a0 Experimental community building (aka \"nation building\" on a smaller scale) is a job for social engineers with a secular background, not just for religious wonks.",
