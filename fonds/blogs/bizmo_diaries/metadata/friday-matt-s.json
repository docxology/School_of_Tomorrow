I enjoyed this [quick tour](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7154354738162008571) of a newspaper production facility.The IE interface to my control panel for blogging @ Google really sucks on this OS X box -- no editing controls. No wonder Nick is dead in the water (he's packing an iBook or something). I'll continue polishing this posting when I get access to a more usable interface. I don't know if Safari is any better... Nope, sucks as well (not user-friendly).My own [video upload](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/google-gets-video.html) is still in verification.Why am I at Matt's place?  Time for the annual gutter cleaning, followed by the ritual meal.It's Veterans' Day today.  The flags are in place up and down Hawthorne.",
