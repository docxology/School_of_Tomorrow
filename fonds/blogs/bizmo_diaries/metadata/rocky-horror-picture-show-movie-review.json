Participating in a RHPS is something of a rite of passage.\n\nI went with a professor of gender studies and international development who'd never seen the film, turned off by the word \"horror\", a genre she doesn't enjoy.\u00a0 The raucousness of the audience overwhelmed the soundtrack and she came away with a garbled version of the plot, but that's easily rectifiable with later study.\n\nI like pointing out that Tim Curry has a later role in the movie Kinsey, where I plays an ironically prudish professor. One of the best ways to study a culture is by delving in to its sex ed, but then don't make the mistake of thinking education == academia.\u00a0 All media have an educational role.\n\nMy first induction into this cult came way back in my Princeton years, in the late 1970s, much closer to the time when this film, originally a stage play in England, where that castle is, first came out.\u00a0\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/35921129496/in/dateposted-public/)",
