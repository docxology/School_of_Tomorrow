had mistakenly assumed that, with a name like Puccini, the guy would know Rome like the back of his hand, maybe own his own Pinocchio factory (like Giapetto) and sell puppets at [Piazza Navona at Christmas time](http://www.flickr.com/photos/army_arch/8297431253/).\u00a0 Nope, turns out he went to Rome precisely to research the script, get the landmarks right.\u00a0 Apparently the old libretto had Angelitto or whatever his name was swimming across the Tiber river to seek sanctuary in St. Peter's.\u00a0 But as we all know, these two institutions ([Castel Sant Angelo ](http://www.flickr.com/photos/spiri/2460996373/)and St. Peters) share the same bank of that river.\u00a0 The original author was fine with taking dramatic liberties, but Puccini wanted more realism than that.\u00a0 The opera was going through a phase:\u00a0 \"verisimo\" they called it, or verisimilitude.\u00a0 The music was becoming more like a soundtrack.\n\nI've been putting on my [Teilhard de Chardin goggles](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/01/some-adjustments.html) from time to time and looking at history with that benefit of hindsight.\u00a0 Sure, the explosion in logic made little sense at the turn of the last century.\u00a0 What were they thinking?\u00a0 Their rationality hardly improved and politics stayed as dumb as ever, so what was that all about?\u00a0 Looking back, the computer languages were being born.\u00a0 Lineages were getting started.\u00a0 Turing fed into Von Neumann with channels back to player pianos and other hole-punch controlled devices.\u00a0 Ada, Hopper...\u00a0 It all makes so much sense in retrospect.\u00a0 Like evolution creating the eye.\n\nLikewise one can see the stage as prototypical of the \"big screen\" we'd be getting later (Plato's Cave version 3), which is still pushing the envelope at 48 frames per second of little Hobbits running around in IMAX 3D.\u00a0 That's what we're up to by the time of [this writing](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-heady-xmas.html).\n\nBack in Puccini's day, we didn't have film yet, but we had something very like IMAX 3D, namely The Opera.\u00a0 And the singing took (still takes) real athletic capability.\u00a0 Not just anyone could belt it out like that without slipping.\u00a0 In any case, artists had what amounts to a big screen, and they had a sound track to think about.\u00a0 So there were lots of things to try, lots of niches to carve out.\u00a0 Theater evolved in parallel.\u00a0 Then we had \"[musicals](http://youtu.be/JrYz8qcFsXs)\" (not opera, but operatic). \n\nLooking back, Puccini was an early film director and verisimo was a move to ground more in the nitty gritty of the time, any time.\u00a0 Yes, a genre, but an anticipatory one.\n\nThey say Puccini went to great lengths to get to tone of St. Peter's bell right.\n\nYes, it's been a long time.\u00a0 When I was young and thin and more like a fish, clambering around on that [Trevi Fountain guy](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jesscamp/5366351982/) with [my friends](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2006/06/machine-world.html) (we didn't steal the coins tourists were throwing, and we were tolerated as colorful youth, boys at play never mind we might be expats) I used to get \"dragged to the opera\" quite often by my culture-loving parents.\u00a0 I was getting some of the best of the best back then, but didn't really realize it.\u00a0 Now I'm back, as a gray.\u00a0 I blended right in too, though I also saw quite a few kids, along for the ride with mom or more likely grandmom or dad.\n\nWhat I need to sort out is the back story.\u00a0 What was the Vatican doing vis-a-vis Napoleon and why was the escapee being pursued?\u00a0 What was the painter's view of Napolean's wins or losses?\u00a0 And what was Scarpia the secret police chief of again?\u00a0 Of what exactly?\u00a0 Was that the Vatican's secret police or what?\u00a0 I'll have to do some more homework eventually, fit those puzzle pieces together.\u00a0 After Super Bowl:\u00a0 OK, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosca) clears it all up, complicated story, all the worse because Napoli (Naples), ruling Rome at the time of the play (set in 1800) is not named for Napoleon (Neo Polis = New City).\u00a0 Speaking of which, good to hear [Civitavechia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civitavecchia) mentioned.\u00a0 That was Etruscan you know.\n\nAnd that was [my Superbowl Sunday](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/02/superbowl-sunday.html) folks.\u00a0 Doesn't sound like I'll be [doing any comments](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2010/02/post-game.html) on the commercials, per previous years (I sometimes scan them for geometry).\u00a0 I did [write about the cuboctahedron](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mathfuture/C69NXWijEF0/tj-oDK4x-tsJ) on Math Future though.\n\nOh well.\u00a0 Opera is cool too, not just kicking (and throwing) some ball around.\n\nI hear the power went out in the stadium.\u00a0 That's pretty interesting.\u00a0 Tell us more.",
