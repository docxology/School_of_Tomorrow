  "content": "Michael Douglas is exquisitely good at portraying psychos or getting caught up in some psycho situation.\u00a0 I'd not seen this before.\u00a0 Look how she runs to the phone, even though she knows it's probably her anger management problem ex.\u00a0 They're slaves to that ringer, and when I hear it again, I remember, you had to run.\u00a0 It was always important.\u00a0 No caller ID.\u00a0 No voicemail.\u00a0 Dark ages.\n\nThis is a dark comedy about a defense contractor who loses his job and goes postal but in a way that builds.\u00a0 The funnier role is the old cop (probably my age) about to retire (last day) who starts seeing the pattern and can't help but jump in.\u00a0 It's a personal growth experience for him as well, and ex dad gets to go swimming while angel child has her birthday, so happy ending. \n\nAnyway, Lindsey pulled this from her stash of VHSs because I'd told her I was \"resigning from Oversight\" (as an Overseer of [our Quaker meeting](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/11/seven-psychopaths-movie-review.html)) and that sounded melodramatic, like maybe I'm being \"Mr. White\" (Breaking Bad) or this guy, in Falling Down.\n\nAlthough I've been dressing up more, sporting a blazer, I'm actually more [the Voodoo Donuts guy](http://fringewebpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/copyright-logo.jpg), pushing something softer and sweeter (new donut place on Hawthorne, [Blue Star](http://pdx.eater.com/places/blue-star-donuts)).\u00a0 And no big deal on the Oversight thing as I worked double time in April-May so earned early retirement big time.\u00a0 I deserve the R&R and left a flurry of fun memos.",
