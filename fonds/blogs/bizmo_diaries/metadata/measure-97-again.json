  "content": "Foes of Measure 97 have cleverly portrayed it as a \"tax on sales\" but not a sales tax.  Everyone knows Oregonians are happy to get by without a regressive sales tax.\n\nProperty taxes stay relatively high.  I just got my bill today in fact, over $4K on a non-commercially zoned lot, with a house over a hundred years old on it, plus garage.  Walnut tree.  Rhododendron.\n\nPeople like me pay for schools, not the out-of-state big guys, who just wanna make a killing. \n\nWhat business can't model itself as gaining revenue from \"sales\" of some kind.  Health care, cable TV... all end user consumer services.\u00a0 It's a tax on revenue, on the bottom line, and yes, that relates to one's gross.\n\nTherefore to be anti \"tax on sales\" is to be anti tax on business, period.\n\n\"We don't want to pay taxes and as big businesses you can't make us\" is the attitude.\u00a0 \"Let us gross whatever we can and make the little guy shoulder all payments.\"\u00a0 They do the same thing around wars.\n\nWhat's a poor little US state gonna do, with the Feds run by greedy Wall Street, or LAWCAP or whatever?\u00a0 Squeezing a small state is no problemo for them, given the USG has already caved.\n\nSo yeah, those hoping to improve the state's schools and other services may be disappointed come November.  The outcome of the propaganda war is far from predetermined.\n\nMaybe Oregon could run some tourist attracting passenger trains with adjoining communities in the outback?\n\nWe don't have train tracks to Breitenbush, a hot tub paradise, which is private, but you get the idea.\n\nInstitutions of higher education might get in on the campus planning. [Go by train](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/10/go-by-train.html), stop off here and there to [get an education](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/03/work-study-programs.html).\n\nDon't let the naysayers who won't pay their fair share advertise [Project Earthala](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2007/04/about-earthala-tv.html) as their idea.\n\nWe have\u00a0 more intelligent sponsors to boast of than Comcast.\u00a0 Some of our partners behind the scenes don't mind feeding the public/private partnerships these foes of Oregon might consider inconvenient. Pleasing Obnoxico is not our priority.\n\nDoing more to work my agenda regarding Measure 97 funding professional development courses for coteachers:  [https://t.co/NGnCG57WMa](https://t.co/NGnCG57WMa) (F/B)\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [October 18, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/788432309980499968)\n\nIf you wanna view the raw memo, no need to pester Wikileaks, I've got it for you here: [https://t.co/0qM330o4ui](https://t.co/0qM330o4ui) (revamping high school math).\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [October 18, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/788432672154464256)",
