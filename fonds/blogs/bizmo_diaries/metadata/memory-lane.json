We could be doing a lot more around the timeline concept, is one of my Pirate Party planks.  I'm for treating Homer Davenport's scenario they same way, as one of those Open Sesame scenarios that leads to a wealth of other partially overlapping scenarios (i.e. there's a Big World in there, a veritable circus).\n\nHow I'd tie the Homer and Bucky scenarios together is through world expos, the one in Chicago, where electricity made its debut, and the one in Oregon, the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition.\u00a0 This thread twists around the Disney thread, and takes us into the aerospace sector (Tomorrow Land), as well as to global grids on Dymaxion Maps.",
