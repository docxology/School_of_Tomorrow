  "content": "From Facebook profile: \n\nIs\n it time to talk about inviting some foreign military bases to North \nAmerica, in the name of reciprocity?  So many US in Okinawa and \nGuantanamo.  Oregon might be OK with a couple bases.  They're mostly \nused for joint marching band exercises, sports, practice using crowded \nairways.  We'll bring back the cavalry and make movies.\nCh\u00f6gyam Trungpa had an army going as I recall. They'd drill and stuff. Oregon could host a Tibetan military base, except the weapons would be metaphysical (like incense).",
