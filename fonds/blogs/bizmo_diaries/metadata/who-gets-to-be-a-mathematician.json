Humans claim to do it consciously, as a brain activity, on\n top of a 99% automated metabolism.\n\nSure,\n universities want their name on the bottle, when the math smells and \ntastes like the real deal. They\u2019re like wine merchants. However I\u2019m \nalways willing to accredit the mathematical abilities, properties and \npractices I encounter in so many walks of life. Fine wines come with \nmany labels.\n\nEnglish\n majors studying New England Transcendentalism come up against a lot of \narchitecture and geometry these days. Their PhD may be in American \nLiterature of the 1900s, but that means knowing what the \u201cisotropic \nvector matrix\u201d is all about (1970s metaphysics), and of course \n\u201ctetravolumes\u201d. No, this isn\u2019t mathematics necessarily, but when it \ncomes to Reality Modeling, such concepts have utility.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/30187479138/in/dateposted-public/)",
