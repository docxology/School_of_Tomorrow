Does Google maps have the overlays we need?\u00a0 What other map services will we need, to keep out Kabul-to-Istanbul lanes flowing smoothly?\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/32880377061/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nTrucking as currently designed allows [precious little time](https://youtu.be/y4V0aJudHhw) for tourism.\u00a0 It's dock-to-dock, through the dirty side of most cities.\u00a0 Many people treat truck drivers rather poorly.\u00a0 That's where the academics come in:\u00a0 drivers get a full-blown work-study program.\u00a0 Our curriculum is about more than moving freight.\u00a0 Lets think about families.\n\n[](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/woodruff/files/2013/06/crumb_truckin.jpg)",
