We were talking about /Crypto, where prime versus composite reigns supreme (as a distinction), so now lets segue to Elizebeth Friedman.\n\nShe fell in with Shakespeare early in her career, where she sharpened her code skills and met her future husband.\u00a0 They and their sponsor climbed a steep learning curve ladder and ended up becoming like another Bletchley Park eventually.\u00a0 Elizebeth faced her own enigmas.\n\nIn my Quakerish curriculum we're linking her to Prohibition and to the early Bucky who socialized with Al Capone.\u00a0 That helps sync up the timelines for for these several protagonists we'll be following.\n\nThe tie-back to Shakespeare is convenient, given our Memory Palace focus (\"the urb it orbs\").\u00a0 Globe Theater architecture was about the microcosm, as well as the play within the play.\n\nI notice Github decided to break Jupyter Notebooks linking back to their own repo as the default option.\u00a0 The benefits of cloning and owning the repo locally, versus viewing it online, has just increased.",
