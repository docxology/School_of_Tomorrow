  "content": "Dawn had a front row seat on Haystack Rock at Cannon Beach, in the company of her dear cousin Pat and friend Lil.  They lugged the 02 concentrator and some mini-tanks.  Next will be Kennedy School.  I've been playing shuttle driver, going to and from the airport:  mom yesterday, Alexia just in.  I'm hoping to show them Dawn's new knowledge lab maybe later today.This morning, I open sourced an internal [Fuller School memo](http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=1386658) to the [The Math Forum](http://mathforum.org/), talking about how I'm busy prototyping this new way of teaching mathematics, using some OO language (like I'm using Python) plus linking in a namespace along the lines of my [rbf.py](http://www.4dsolutions.net/cgi-bin/py2html.cgi?script=/ocn/python/rbf.py), with polyhedra organized per the [Synergetics](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/synergetics.html) [concentric hierarchy](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/volumes.html), with the [duo-tet](http://www.4dsolutions.net/) and other nomenclature (e.g. [Couplers](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2005/11/half-coupler.html), [A & B modules](http://www.4dsolutions.net/synergetica/synergetica5.html)) anchoring.[](http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1134/545/1600/plate23.jpg)[Plate #23](http://www.rwgrayprojects.com/synergetics/plates/figs/plate23.html)I'm hopeful that curriculum writers already making a commitment to computer technology, such as [TSF](http://www.tsf.org.za/) now funds, will find much that is useful in this design.  Maybe [BFI](http://www.bfi.org/) could help some of the other foundations channel wisely.  Not all are equally savvy about the design science potential, and as [The Da Vinci Code](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382625/) proves (the media phenomenon), where there're snakes, there's snake oil.",
