  "content": "We will need writers who can remember freedom.  We need writers who know the difference between the production of a market commodity, and the practice of an art.\u00a0 So says Ursala Le Guin, another WILPF member (like [my mom](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/10/mystics.html)).\n\nSpeaking of science fiction, the [Martian Math](http://wikieducator.org/Martian_Math) I'm using, not unlike Tolkien's Elvyn in living internally to [some \"middle earth\"](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2014/12/hobbit-economics.html) (a virtual nation we might say), features this artifact that looks like [a caltrop](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2015/09/manga-on-mul.html), if anyone knows what that is, not a jack in other words.\u00a0 A jack is a six-spoked affair whereas a caltrop has only four spokes.\n\nIf you've taken linear algebra you know the 90 degree turn is into a whole other dimension, a twilight zone almost, given its 100% linear independence from the first ray in the picture.\n\nThe real estate from 0.01 degrees to 179.99 degrees is all brought into being by this Dim 2 (second dimension) but pointing 180 degrees opposite is back to Dim 1.\u00a0 The clock hands lie flat, so back to one line, not a triangle anymore.\n\nJust taking the negative of a basis vector, is not to get a new basis vector, or dimension, as we're to see only three infinite lines through a shared center, with travel in both directions a property of any line or road.\n\nThe caltrop is nonetheless fewer spokes, four is less than six, incontrovertibly.\u00a0 In making all four \"positive\" with these labels: (1,0,0,0) (0,1,0,0) (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1), we're creating canonical linear combinations, road maps of zero or forward motion along these four directions, to any point in space.\n\nThe six-spoked XYZ artifact offers the same advantages:\u00a0 a unique address per every point, a distance formula, ways of computing angles.\u00a0 Going back and forth between XYZ and [Quadrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadray_coordinates) is what many an Earthian diplomat learns in grade school, in preparing to work with the Martians on projects.\u00a0 Their unit volume is not a cube.\n\nThe XYZ vendors claim they're touting most economical warez, in that three basis vectors, mutually orthogonal, are enough for their scheme to pan out.\u00a0 Yes, negative signs are needed, to show basis vector mirroring, and eight octants get created.\u00a0 That does not mean we should kowtow to the Martians.\u00a0 They could learn from us Earthlings.\n\nAs you can see, there's a lot going on in this science fiction, with factions right from the get go.\u00a0 Having the two coordinate systems in the picture is the first step towards at least having some interesting debates and conversations, during which terminological questions are clarified, definitions more clearly cast.\n\nHowever some teachers protest that linear algebra students have enough on their plates.\u00a0 Martian Math may sound like fun in theory, but [adulthood is calling](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/10/surveying-pedagogy.html).\u00a0 We don't have time for gratuitous [brain teasers](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2005/12/heptagons.html).\u00a0 Who ever heard of a unit volume that wasn't cube-shaped, anyway?\n\nFor my part, I think all six XYZ vectors should get equal pay for equal work and therefore -(1,0,0) i.e. (-1,0,0) is just as much a basis vector as its oppositely pointing counterpart.\u00a0 That's not the official definition of course.\u00a0 That's where philosophy comes in, to provide that subjunctive layer of \"could have been otherwise\" -- even in mathematics. \n\nMartian Math in science fiction, from the Silicon Forest: [https://t.co/bO4SOeMWIk](https://t.co/bO4SOeMWIk) (warning: [#mathy](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mathy?src=hash) [#mathsy](https://twitter.com/hashtag/mathsy?src=hash) and maybe a tad surreal).\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [October 27, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/791513120808153088)",
