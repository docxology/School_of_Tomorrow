  "content": "I returned to the scene proclaiming \"BS\" to be OK, defending it.\u00a0 That might have been a kind of ice breaker, but the conversation was already rolling.\n\nI think I missed Michael's didj playing.\u00a0 I'd retreated from the retreat earlier, after pizza arrived, to check on my family.\u00a0 This was the Summer Solstice.\u00a0 Wanderers acknowledge these astronomical days.\n\nGlenn is a font of information about the \"goal posts\" (solstices), and the zig zag path of [the Annalemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma) between them, the lines of the so-called tropics.\u00a0 Many an [ancient statue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoastronomy) has these goal post arms.\n\nMichelle's group had joined us.\u00a0 Good to catch up.\u00a0 Thanks also to Christine, Helen, David DiNucci.\n\nI started reading about the history of Earlham College today, having invested in the book after [my tour of the campus](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2012/06/touring-earlham-college.html) thanks to a student from Kazakstan:\u00a0 Earlham College:\u00a0 A History from 1847 to 1997 by Thomas D. Hamm.\n\nQuakers were found to be subversive by grand juries in some states because of their stance against slavery from the late 1700s forward.\u00a0 The position was nuanced in that some Quakers asserted the slavers' rights on the principle of church and state separation.\n\nAs long as the state said it was legal, who were these churches to say otherwise?\u00a0 The War of Independence had been fought for a reason, one being to end the tyranny of church dogmas, be those the Church of England's or any other.\n\nBut the fact that Quakers had disowned any of their own who kept slaves, a painful enough process, gave them that \"holier than thou\" aspect that rubbed [slaverholders](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/04/django-unchained-movie-review.html) the wrong way.\u00a0 Plus everyone knew they encouraged escapees to continue north, rather than turn them in to the authorities.\n\nIndianapolis to this day has that central monument to the Civil War, in which it fought on the side of the Union.\u00a0 When Quakers started escaping the South, that future war was as yet prophesied (projected) by only a few.\n\nThe split between Orthodox and Hicksites was also still somewhat new, and was rending meetings.\u00a0 The alchemy of these [many splits and distillations](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/4120827538/in/set-72157622719474211/) is not that easily followed, with [\"Quaker guts\" posters](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/logistics.html) telling only part of that tale.\n\nToo often, the tale of slavery gets divorced from the tale of Indian Wars.\u00a0[ Indiana](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2009/09/indian-summer.html) was named that for a reason.\n\nHelen, of Jewish heritage, had been quizzing me whether [Quakers](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2012/11/seven-psychopaths-movie-review.html) prayed aloud to God in meeting.\n\nI explained about our silent worship format, and the fact that when Friends break the silence, as moved by the Spirit, they might use [any number of formats](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2009/08/quakers-101.html) or templates, including sometimes a spoken request of a singular deity, a form one might label \"prayer\".\n\nA worship discussion, more like Sunday Morning Adult Discussion (SMAD) allows more in the way of direct commentary and feedback.\n\nUnlike those training in Roman oratory, Friends do not have a direct debate format.\u00a0 Himalayan schools [apparently have this](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0201840/) and it might be to our benefit to develop in this direction.\u00a0 The say Quakers avoid confrontation sometimes to their detriment.\n\nAlso at the Wanderers retreat, we used Google Earth on my Android to circle Breitenbush Hot Springs and Detroit Lake.\u00a0 Christine has helped clear a lot of trails around there, while another of us present had grown up in a dam-building family, like Glenn's did, his dad a chief engineer for [the Detroit Lake dam](http://www.oregonencyclopedia.org/entry/view/detroit_dam/).",
