The greens have a strong father chief too, with offspring.\u00a0 The whites have their reincarnated guy with his left-behind \"monkey boy\" son.\n\nThe blue family seems very like The Incredibles family (also Disney), especially the teen girl, who feels marginalized as a four finger, and who is developing psychic powers beyond her peers (see Beetlejuice for another take on this character).\u00a0 She saves the day on numerous occasions.\u00a0 The younger boy does too, in bonding with the four eyed whale, the outcast one who had tried to fight the sky people earlier.\n\nThe plot is complicated but basically goes like this:\u00a0 the bad guy Marine and his ilk (the sky people) have returned in their spaceships (buckyballs!) with a special grudge against the blue family dad.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe blue family, to protect their own people, decide to hide out amongst the greens, which is controversial as the blues are forest people with underdeveloped lung power for undersea activities.\u00a0 The greens agree to take in these Incredibles and teach them their watery ways, but it isn't long before the whites figure out where they are, and a fight ensues.\n\nCameron did both Aliens and Titanic and really knows how to put together a believable Machine World, an extrapolation of our own.\u00a0 He also knows how to tilt the decks, as the ship is sinking, making the\u00a0 passengers slide and/or climb what had been horizontal surfaces.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSigourney Weaver plays her cameo role, as the human mother of the blue teen with psychic abilities.\u00a0 This mother and daughter don't meet directly in person, but on a psychic plane, in a dream state.\n\nOn the whole, I was glad to revisit this world and continue processing the machine versus natural technology rift.\u00a0 The technology of the Native Americans is higher in many ways, if we include nature herself as a kind of Mech 'n Tech (which she is).\u00a0 Whales are higher tech than any aircraft carrier, and so on.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe brutish sky people are the Euro whites, the neo-Romans, the US Army more specifically.\u00a0 A lot of what this subculture is most proud of comes in for criticism, in part simply for being so hackneyed, but also in the tradition of great westerns such as Little Big Man, and Dances with Wolves.\u00a0 Europe is the dying world.\u00a0 America, already inhabited, is the new world.\n\nI saw the film by myself at The Bagdad and although the film was long, I didn't take any pee breaks.\u00a0 Nor did I have my customary IPA or other drink (which probably helped) as I've given up beer (but not wine or gin).",
