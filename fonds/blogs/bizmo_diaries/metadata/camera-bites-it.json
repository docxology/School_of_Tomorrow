  "content": ":: out of service ::\n\nData miners of this blog may find out about my appreciation for the Nikon Coolpix S8200, which I've purchased three times, meaning twice replaced. \n\nTonight the 3rd incarnation hit the floor and would not turn on, though it did USB its pictures. \u00a0I've already been on eBay, bidding on a fourth.\n\nFollowup:\u00a0 looks like I snagged another one for under $80, including shipping.\u00a0 Lets hope it's for real.\u00a0 February 9 followup:\u00a0 it wasn't.\u00a0 Not in stock, listed incorrectly.\u00a0 Tried again, for same model, $108 retail direct, from TheDigitalPros.com.\n\nNo wait, the $108 loss-leader was open box and all in Turkish.\u00a0 The sales guy talked me into a Nikon Coolpix S9200 instead, for another $71.\u00a0 He persuaded me I was being a Luddite buying a fourth copy of a discontinued model.\n\nAnd now for something completely different:\u00a0 layers of complexity.\n\nNo, not recursive exactly so much as fractal, analogous from level to level, but not identical.\n\nAfter all, the physics changes as one traverses the size spectrum, given the surface-to-volume ratio is not constant.\u00a0\u00a0 Children on pogo sticks tend to make it look easy, just bouncing up and down like that.\n\n:: by cyriak ::",
