  "content": "I got good and winded running to the bus for this one, almost door-to-door.  I'd forgotten where the door was though, which added time.  I barely had time to swig a beer and grab a piece of Fat Tuesday pastry at Urban Airship before the charming Michelle hassled me to grab a nametag.  My name was spelled backwards (ala Leonardo), leading one geek to joke about his mirror iPod app (for when you need to fix your lipstick or whatever).The main talks were by Lindsey Smith regarding feedparser, \"Shmichael\" about PEPs 380 & 3152, Adam Lowry about some ingenious thread tracker he'd written, and Eric Holscher on a way he could track server activity with this nifty graphic web stuff he'd put together.  These were definitely \"makers\", creative bar none.Will I have time to propose an OS Bridge talk this year?  I don't yet have the video clips I'm looking for.  We're in a holding pattern, waiting for the dominant paradigm to admit it could use some stabilizing influences.We went to Bailey's for the after-party again.  As usual, I talked with the gmpy guy from Mentor Graphics, plus someone else who wanted to talk about OpenEMR, other open source medical records initiatives.Remember:  open source doesn't mean open data.  You can have all the source code published and in the clear, and still be as tight as Fort Knox in what you do with it.Some of us are going to Pycon this weekend.  Not me though, gotta work and stop traveling for awhile.  I'll miss the whiskey BOF.  Jason Kirtland had some cool glasses made.  One is depicted below.[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/5516563954/)",
