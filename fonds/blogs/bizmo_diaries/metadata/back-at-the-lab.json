  "content": "\"Back at the Lab\" sounds white coaty, but I'm talking [Lucky Lab here](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2006/05/lucky-lab.html), the brewpub that does Dogtoberfest (coming right up -- or did it happen already?).\u00a0 I'd say Sarah-the-dog here is a lucky lab, but then she's also part mutt, as the pro breeders might put it.\n\nSteve and I joined the DemocracyLab table.\u00a0 Mark and an associate were about to drive to Seattle even at this late hour, for a conference today.\u00a0 He took us through a demo, where Oregon State's tax income is the focus.\u00a0 How much revenue is from video poker, lotteries?\u00a0 Game winnings are not considered a tax, so these numbers were not shown.\n\nBen stopped over.\u00a0 We'd missed Duke by a smidgen.\n\nNate is heading of to [Strata Rx 2012](http://strataconf.com/rx2012) in the Bay Area.\u00a0 Electronic medical records using free open source software is one of his foci.\u00a0 That may mean he misses [WhereCampPDX](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/at-wherecamppdx.html), where we hung out last year, OPDX (Occupy Portland) by then going strong.\n\nThe Lab was packed with gamers and hackers.\u00a0 Thursday nights are really big there.",
