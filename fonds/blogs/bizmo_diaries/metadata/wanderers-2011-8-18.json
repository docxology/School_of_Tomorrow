  "content": "We talked about Linus Pauling a lot, most appropriately.   [Nate](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/02/open-secrets.html) had seen [the OPB documentary](http://www.opb.org/programs/oregonexperience/programs/player/35-Linus-Pauling), so was up to speed on this being the boarding house towards the start of his biography.   After his dad died, his mom had to make ends meet, while the gifted son explored chemistry in the basement. Nirel slipped in and out of [the Portland Matrix](http://coffeeshopsnet.blogspot.com/2011/08/cto-in-pdx.html) in a flash, another world traveler. Chairman Steve took the head of the table. I've been chirping on a citizens' band (public listserv), letting my peers know about the disposition of [the FnB trailers](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2011/08/fnb-2011811.html).  Even if you're far away on a trip, it's fun to get these [blips](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/08/doing-hard.html) sometimes. [Barry](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/3695569063/) and [Glenn](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/4168582504/) quizzed me on re-roofing plans.  I'm [nowhere close](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/09/more-dreams-in-hood.html) to having blueprints, that's for sure.  But then I'm not [the architect](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/11/visit-with-architect.html). The looming trip has my attention. We also chatted about Bram Pitoyo and Amber Case, as Nate had just come from [listening to Sheldon](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/06/wanderers-2009610.html) talk about \"netness\" some more. Good having [Michael Hagmeier](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/06/another-milestone.html) join us again.",
