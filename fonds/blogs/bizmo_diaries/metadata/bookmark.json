  "content": "I read in Confessions of a Failed Egoist as I awaited my procedure this morning.\n\nI walked some miles to the venue on a bright summery day, but was escorted home by a computer scientist, a precaution, given the drugs involved (nothing that put me under this time).\n\nI was wondering about linking Trevor Blake's writings to Rorty's (my thesis adviser's, one of them), in terms of standing up for oneself.\n\nThoughts for another time, as appointments must be kept.\u00a0 Tea with Lindsey.\u00a0 Looking forward.\n\nFollow-up:\u00a0 the procedure was routine and fairly uneventful.",
