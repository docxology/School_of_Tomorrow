  "content": "Koski had been kicking around the middle states again, Michigan mostly.\u00a0 There's a routine [the nuke plants ](http://masonrydesign.blogspot.com/2012/03/review-of-fukushima-daiichi-nuclear.html)go through, like what you would do for a car at maybe 60K miles (yes, I used miles).\u00a0 Maxi Taxi is set to go in, as she'll disintegrate otherwise.\u00a0 Speaking of which, Glenn's Integral Design is now out of the box.\u00a0 I helped him send [a mug shut](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/7027309161/in/photostream) to a NavAm conference Milt is involved with, where such knowings are shared.\n\n[I phoned Free Skool](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2009/07/passing-torch.html) this morning on the Martian Math front, having done [four new sketches](http://groups.google.com/group/mathfuture/browse_thread/thread/94a8482cef9b72ed) for the Scenarios Training (a kind of Esozone workshop).\u00a0 The content is actually quite easy, a distillation, so it's more about andragogy (where adults are concerned), new pedagogy.\u00a0 People who think we don't still invent new teaching techniques this late in the game are wrong.\u00a0 The technology keeps changing.\n\nTara phoned me from Indiana, having a good time.\u00a0 She relays light switch commands regarding Barry-the-snake.\n\nMelody is feeding Sarah-the-dog.\u00a0 Someone found it funny recently that we gave our animals people names.\u00a0 But then we think of people as animals, some of us do, not really a separate category when it comes to their physicality.\u00a0 When I do object oriented programming, I'll subclass a Human off a Mammal as readily as a Monkey or Pig.\u00a0 Or Dolphin (thinking of Sean's spanking new Wittgenstein class at the moment).\n\nHow does [Free Skool](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2010/03/radical-math.html) relate to [OPDX](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2011/10/domes-future.html) if at all.\u00a0 Did I mention the call failed to go through?\u00a0 It's unusual, these days, for a number to just ring and ring.\u00a0 Before voicemail, which was often a table top box, new life for cassettes, we had more of those \"endless ring\" scenarios.\u00a0 People harassed each other with those, clever mammals that they be.\u00a0 A lot of high tech is about restoring privacy, backing off, mainly through the technique of asynchronous routing.\u00a0 Reflection required.\u00a0 Text me.\n\nUsing the $ symbol in tandem with kwh is not new -- that's how an electric bill reads.\u00a0 It's the \"energy has shape\" dictum which takes use to space-filling phenomena, such as photons and protons.\u00a0 These can be metered and a charge attached to each one.\u00a0 The idea of a dollar as an energy amount is no stranger to the [General Systems Theory](http://www.grunch.net/synergetics/gst3.html) crowd (smart mob).\u00a0 The sun floods us with energy, most of which is reflected back into space, luckily for us.\n\n[](http://www.flickr.com/photos/17157315@N00/7028377663/)\n\nI'm with Dr. Nick at the moment, Bagdad Office, pizza on order.  He's showing me A Fuller View, among other things, new book by Lloyd Sieden. Predictably, Frank Z. jumped back in my inbox when I turned another corner on Synergeo.\u00a0 I can't count how many times I've lapped that guy.\n\nHow to connect Dan Suttin more with Andrius Kulikauskas -- one of the day's conundrums.\u00a0 I submitted a followup to Pycon for the work blog.\u00a0 Presumably Ms. Beck is giving it a once over (which I'm glad of, skillful editor).",
