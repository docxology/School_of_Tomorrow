  "content": "From Facebook:\n\nAsylum\n City was my overture to screenwriters to bring an alternative positive \nfuturism to our screens. Americans in detention camps is a nightmare, so\n is Gaza, but do we have the engineering capability to handle refugees \non a massive scale?\n\n Engineers would rather we look at \npoliticians as the ones in charge. They're the professional scapegoats \nafter all. Yet Alphabet is planning new cities (Sidewalk Labs).\n\nBig tech has the smarts and money. DC sells mercenary services and the \ntools of mass murder for a living. Yet we look to DC for solutions? Go \nfigure.\n\n Why don't kids in cages even get to watch cartoons on \nNetflix? Because they're being punished for daring to pursue happiness, \nlife, liberty.\n\nThe soulless zombie corporations, engineered by lawyers \nlong dead, will gladly kill us all in pursuit of profit. English (the \nlanguage) encodes their personhood. No wonder they call it Voodoo \nEconomics, the namespace of the walking dead (zombie corporations: we \neat your brains).",
