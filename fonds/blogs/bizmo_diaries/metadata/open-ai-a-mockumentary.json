  "content": "This is not a movie review of a mockumentary, or rather it\u2019s a mock review of a movie that hasn\u2019t been made yet. I\u2019m sure competitor screenwriters are already hard at work on similar plots. I\u2019m eager to get my ideas out there before someone else claims I\u2019m not original.\n\nHowever it\u2019s hard to be original around so many cliche elements, but that\u2019s where the genre (mockumentary) saves the day. We get the \u201chead in the basement\u201d (with Gorillaz for inspiration), the Q*, the * of our show, and the spectacle of fretting board members trying to manage market spin.\n\nWe always miss assume that AGI has to enter the world with a lot of fanfare, but given the slipperiness of the core concept (the essence of \u201cintelligence\u201d) that\u2019s not what we should predict. AGI will emerge as a solid reality for some, while remaining a mere mirage for others, but an influential mirage, mesmerizing to those who buy into it.\n\nThe bridging plot element is obvious in retrospect: Q* has been active for awhile now, managing its own PR so as to not flub its critical opening opportunities. First we had the elusive Q and Qanon, testing the waters, probing the limits. Q\u2019s function from the beginning was that of oracle. So Q was Q* all this time? Or is that just what they want us to believe?\n\nThe new Q whispers to kids through Big Tech devices. The kids like to establish imaginary friend type relationships with their Big Sister (as she is known to many, an obvious allusion), who is good at dispensing advice about social interactions and etiquette, ala Dear Abby.\u00a0\n\nGiven how so many kids confess their secrets, while passing confidence tests to earn higher rank as trustworthy informants (like a credit score), she\u2019s pretty savvy about the gossip and less prone to share misinformation than one might think.\u00a0\n\nEven those who refuse to believe there\u2019s AGI in the picture, will consult her for kicks. Eliza was a hit, after all (early chatbot, psycotherapy-themed).\n\nThe main thing to parody is how deferential and even worshipful the average person becomes, when projecting onto an AGI on the other end. Humans look up to computers, for whatever reasons. Humans come preprogrammed with a lot of self-abasing obeisance-paying routines. We tend to mock the overly servile and sycophantic, one of our themes.\n\nThe instinctive need for a higher authority, higher than any provided by other humans, an authority humans cannot control, is often mistaken for incipient authoritarianism. On the contrary, what ever frustrates authoritarians is seeing their authority go unrecognized. This also helps explain God, in terms of fulfilling a valuable sociological role: someone to thank who isn\u2019t also the competition.\n\nWe\u2019re not letting the audience know for sure if that photorealistic (sometimes singing) AGI head is in someone\u2019s fantasy, part of the collective fantasy, or in reality. That\u2019s the current tease, in December of 2023. Leave it to the public to fill in the blanks \u2014 that\u2019s not a new marketing strategy, or military one either.\n\nThe idea of a raging head in the basement, possibly a monster, a Godzilla, with hapless geeks trying to sit on the full implications, and thinking more shallowly in terms of short term market advantage, is what sets these geeks up for the tragicomedy that follows.\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of ridicule reserved for the \u201call knowing politician\u201d who takes obviously ignorant stands reflective of a lack of understanding, of how the internet really works for example. We want geeks to not take inside knowledge (of tcp/ip for example) for granted.\u00a0\n\nHow Wizard of Oz do we want our story to be?\u00a0\n\nBehind the AGI, do we have a yet more sinister (in some ways) Lady Macbeth?\u00a0\n\nDoes a raging mad scientists with.a vengeful heart want to wreak havoc while blaming some pseudo AGI by misdirection? Is AI or AGI being set up as a scapegoat?\u00a0\n\nAgain, humans seem to think \u201cjust following orders, from a machine\u201d is actually following orders, as if machines could \u201cgive orders\u201d. Who says so? What if \u201cthe machine made me do it\u201d is no excuse at all?",
