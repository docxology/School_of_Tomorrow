  "content": "[Jimmy] Dore's view is \"yes Russians \ntroll, so does everyone doing net stuff\" and to gain a following you \nstart dealing in juicy memes, becoming one of the thought leaders somehow \n(who knows how, that's where the \"research\" comes in; Cambridge \nAnalytica had their OCEAN etc.).\u00a0\n\nThen when you have a following you can \nspam them for business reasons i.e. sell advertising (turn around to \ncompanies and say \"you pay me and I'll tell my following about your \nthing\").\u00a0\n\nWhereas DNCers see Internet Research Agency dealing in \npolitical memes with an agenda to tip the election, the Dore crowd see \n\"business as usual\" where oligarchy is concerned, and which the Russian \nmafia plays along with everybody else, with more interest in getting or \nstaying rich than in trying to directly play \"king of the White House\" \n(just be sure you have some access once the slug fest is over -- what an\n embassy is for).\u00a0\n\nThat's pretty much my view too: there's no need to \nrisk exposure (e.g. FBI detection) hacking federal elections machinery, \nwhen social media already provide a legal means to play mind games with \nthe public.\u00a0\n\nI believe Russians [actively engage in social media](https://medium.com/@kirbyurner/polysci-a-look-back-at-russiagate-b34e08bb9383), most \ndefinitely, and echo the DNI report in saying RT is up on its game.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/3890131554/in/photolist-26xTvWw-rETEMR-oCevSK-bviRwD-9BjcKG-9s3TSF-6XAiwP-6VKWzG)",
