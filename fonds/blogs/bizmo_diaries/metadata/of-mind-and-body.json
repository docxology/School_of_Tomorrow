  "content": "I got in a long talk with David Koski after dinner last night.\u00a0 Annual Session is still going strong (I made it to both Open Mic and most of Community Night -- in time to see the Friend in Residence juggle (he's professional grade, can do five balls etc.)).\u00a0 Great to meet someone who reads my blog at dinner, a novelist (I think of my blog as \"like a Russian novel\" sometimes -- so many characters).\n\nA night or two before, I'd been watching [this interview of Mike Judge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khTqmN2Lths) by Alex Jones, the guy behind Idiocracy ([the movie](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2007/04/idiocracy-movie-review.html)) as well as King of the Hill and Beavis and Butthead (animations).\n\nI found talking to Koski to be the ultimate contrast.\u00a0 He's still fired up, in a comic book kind of way, (flashing on Crumb) but it's about such cerebral material: vZome and Zome Tool, the upcoming Bridges, dissections of the enneacontahedron and the five rhombic dodecahedrons within (was it five?).\n\nHe's also enthralled with that Archimidean set of Eureka! ratios:\u00a0 [the sphere and cone in the cylinder](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2010/08/tabor-walk.html), with volumes 4, 1, 6 respectively (cylinder = two \"tuna cans\" marked by the sphere's equator, each of volume 3).\u00a0 I imagine the animation, veering off into colorful geometry as David holds forth, passionate, weaving together stories with heroes and villains, holding our attention.\n\nDavid had just finished reading [Me & Lee](http://www.meandlee.com/), after I turned him on to [Mary's Mosaic](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2013/05/murder-mystery.html) (thanks to Lanahan). \n\nIn my science fiction (fantasies about some future), there's more walking between centers, hikes through the woods, more like [that Girl Scout Camp](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2013/05/wqm-spring-2013.html) but even more spread out.\u00a0 This helps with staying in shape and burning calories (as well as not concentrating too much power in any one \"lodge\" or \"HQS\").\n\nHere at Pacific University, I have but yards between vast quantities of food, and my dorm room.\u00a0 It's almost as bad as at home, where I can waddle back and forth from mentoring to kitchen.\u00a0 I think of ways to change the environment, such that I keep burning those joules at a higher rate.\u00a0 Sharing the gym membership helps a little.\u00a0 Having the second bike stolen added delays.\u00a0 Food Not Bombs is healthy living.\n\nSpeaking of which, Lindsey got a workout [pulling those two trailers](https://network23.org/lindseywalker/2013/07/20/food-not-bombs-east-of-82nd/) (I've done that, but only one or two times and for less distance), helping to widen our radius.\u00a0 This neighborhood had probably never heard of FNB.\u00a0 Tomorrow the world (no wait, we've already got that covered -- only thinly).\n\nOK, time for breakfast.",
