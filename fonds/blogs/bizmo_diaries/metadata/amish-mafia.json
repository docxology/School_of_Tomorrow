  "content": "I'm not calling this a movie review because we're talking about a made-for-TV series, meaning we bypassed the old-timey big screen theater distribution networks (e.g. Miramax) and went straight to cable (which includes satellite and optical fiber).\u00a0 Netflix tends to pick it up from there (just kidding, we have lots of subnets, very diverse).\n\nIn any case, I'm finding myself pleasantly entertained by this pseudo-documentary genre, many faces blurred to protect the innocent.\u00a0 Amish maybe get some protection from English viewers, and we the English get to see our Mafia turf wars transposed into an innocent key, with buggy races not allowed in Levi's court. Merlin, an Ohio rival, another Mafia boss, muscles in.\n\nI rented this first season alongside season two of Fear the Walking Dead, picking up at the coastline, now that our families have escaped the LA zone.\n\nHowever it's not like I have oodles of hours to watch soap operas.\u00a0 I'm doing full time work with a rush hour on both ends, ala the North American fossil-fueled nightmare (not complaining). Amish Mafia + Mennonite helps this old bones Quaker unwind a bit before midnight or whatever Zs time.\n\nWhat stretches credibility is that a documentary film crew would get just this angle, with intimate relationship scenes on the Sarasota beach (no worries, everyone stays fully clothed). Why would Levi allow cameras?\u00a0 Actually that makes plenty of sense: he covers his butt as Amish special operations, given he's never really alone with her. They're all using the film crew to tell their side of it.\u00a0 We're the ET observers.\n\nJohn the malcontent-in-trouble is hilarious, as is the Mennonite intense. I know these people, have met them many times.\u00a0 The eternal vibe in this transposition is what makes it both Biblical and high comedy all in an anthropological bundle.\n\nI love it when they speak Dutch, so Afrikaner in some ways, said the Englishman, right?\u00a0 Actually the Afrikaners don't equate USAers with UKers, remembering some earlier conflict I suppose.\u00a0 I've written on that topic more elsewhere.",
