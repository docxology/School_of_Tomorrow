  "content": "Santa & Co. was hoping Google would streamline [the wealth redistribution system](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2008/12/iron-mountain-revisted.html) this year, by setting up this machine in the Grotto, where orders and demands might be processed, after sorting them by naughty and nice (standard protocol).However, Python Nation's benevolent dictator Guido Van Rossum apparently submitted something completely \"off the scale\" on the naughtiness meter, and broke the machine.There's a headline announcing a search for the guy, perhaps to demand an apology.  Here's the news bulletin on Channel 6:[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj2BRvTSXLEQ4eeGCgdqlLuo3lLrDrV9E9_YyXxUiZFC1vwsrRahUPhlJb7BYG_uv3hK-tjIFzIGKETg7-5ObBpl8u50uvcO3gLM4zOhglH4ix0I7yvzj8bHjI3ubbf-1Evr2pd/s1600-h/grinch.png)[Channel 6 TV News:  Christmas Crisis Unfolds](http://www.channel6tvnews.com/story/agc2dHZuZXdzcgsLEgRjYXJkGPEkDA)Of course this may have something to do with a finalized Python 3.0 coming out.  Up to the last minute, some skeptics didn't believe he'd really go through with it and release a truly backwardly incompatible Python (wasn't \"plays well with others\" one of the mottoes?).In that case, I think journalists are making a mountain out of a molehill, probably misinterpreting the action (not the first time) as of course PY3K was long in the planning, Y2K a model, and no one [close to the action](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2008/10/ppug-20081014.html) is actually that panicked about it.Maybe someone should [tell Santa](http://mail.python.org/pipermail/edu-sig/2008-December/008917.html)?",
