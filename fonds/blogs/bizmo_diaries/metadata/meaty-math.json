  "content": "I wouldn't say this video is freely associative in a rambling, wandering sense, like one of mine. However\u00a0 I would say it connects a lot of dots nevertheless, especially when it comes to wiring in some CT (Category Theory).\u00a0\n\nWe have the generic sense of \"coordinate system\" to play with, i.e. making a hard problem solvable may involve using a different coordinate system, with a path to and from.\u00a0\n\nConvert to, solve, convert from.\u00a0\n\nHowever we might also think in terms of \"namespaces\".\u00a0\n\nTranslate into, solve, translate out of.\u00a0\n\nBut then what's lost in translation and do the analogies hold?\n\nA good example from the high school level is the basis for the slide rule: turn a multiplication problem into an addition problem by adding the exponents instead, using lookup tables (in the old days) to go both ways.\n\nTake the logs of the two numbers you want to multiply, add those, and get the anti-log of the sum to find the corresponding product. We sometimes draw that as a rectangle, like in the video. \n\n[](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiF5HR-lxoMw1uziidpBsOF8xh1jzZPsbgTiJ-GX3xVqf8XzxNwi13ywqEiOsNZGOw6jp7LJuj_E5CmojeRPtwvQ8yzAreqlvZ9Fb46WvyDadvec-H3OJeSoafUT-Whk2RAq-kOQ1MVhwLf_wDUGRVwsafG8gqs1ZJoUMakqB6ST5WtmoEB9Cbe/s589/Screen%20Shot%202023-08-22%20at%2010.47.30%20AM.png)",
