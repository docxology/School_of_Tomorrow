They owe a lot to Texas Instruments, at least in some zip codes.\u00a0 Why put them in a corner with [the #CodeCastle concept](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/07/base-10-ghetto.html)?\n\nI'm taking pressure off UMC now that I better understand the ecosystem. [https://t.co/jsliTJYMSu](https://t.co/jsliTJYMSu) \u2026  Sometimes we need to respect inertia.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [September 4, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/772445850266054656)\n\nQuakers have fewer ties.\u00a0 I think I've been blinded by the obvious in some ways.\n\nThese powerful Raspbian devices, if [openly flaunting](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/09/sky-pi-channel.html) their relevance to math learning, will not be accepted with open arms in many schools, where entrenched interests call the shots.\u00a0 They'll be perceived as a threat. We need to stay polite and [conforming, non-confrontational](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/pandering-to-muggles-editorial.html).\n\nTherefore I'm recommending going with the flow, buying the TI calculator for math tests, and studying the Pi stuff in a PWS (personal work studio) [if you can find one](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/08/refugees-camping.html).\u00a0 Not the Pi stuff necessarily (a fun option), more the GNU World, including serious \"hard fun\" coding, with Euclid's Method and all the rest of it (SQL... regular expressions).\n\nMaybe learn about RSA from some old Linux hobbyist magazines to get the flavor, or look for [translated Manga](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/09/gateway-to-asia.html).\u00a0 Stores around Portland have made those Linux mags [harder to find](http://mybizmo.blogspot.com/2016/08/suicide-squad-movie-review.html) lately, and if that's happening in Portland you can bet the dumbing down is even further advanced in the heartland.\n\nRemember, if they really wanted you to have the skills to which they give lip service (e.g. \"learning to code\"), you wouldn't be commanded to buy a Texas Instruments graphing calculator.\u00a0 You might be introduced to the Anaconda distro instead (from Continuum Analytics), and Jupyter Notebooks.\u00a0 Not that it's either / or necessarily.\u00a0 Maybe your school has both the [delta and lambda tracks](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/04/a-pep-talk-of-my-own.html).\n\nRemember to look up Mathematics for the Digital Age sometime, by the Litvins (Skylit Press).\u00a0 You already know about [Hacking Math Class](http://worldgame.blogspot.com/2016/06/pycon-2016-concludes.html), the Pi based classic by Peter Farrell.\u00a0 Both high school level.\n\nFortunately, we have Champaign-Urbana and the University of Illinois, and of course Wolfram, to keep at least a few lights burning in that neck of the woods.\u00a0 North America may indeed be dark with ignorance, but the Internet is ablaze with lots of new and interesting information.\u00a0 Raspbians find one another.\u00a0 Ubuntu is real.\n\nYou'll find Wolfram Language on many Raspbian distros, such as on the Jessie distro I'm using (runs Docker).\u00a0 Yes, it could be faster, this is a training wheels computer in some ways, but that's better than no bicycle at all, right?\u00a0 The process is one of bootstrapping.\n\nMaybe you'll have several cloud computers in addition. Your school might spin those up for you, customized per course.\u00a0 We did that at the [O'Reilly School of Technology](http://archive.oreilly.com/oreillyschool/index.html), simulating a client-side Windows pointed at a Linux server (a typical setup back in the day).\n\nI'm still to this day [using Eclipse](https://flic.kr/p/KQjLv5) for [my tiny Flask application](http://controlroom.blogspot.com/2016/08/dissecting-flask-app.html), even on El Capitan.\u00a0 What can I say?\u00a0 It grew on me. I came to [like the dog food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) we served.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/29242014346/in/dateposted-public/)\n\nSimply having a WiFi cafe on the premises gets us devices, smartphones, laptops... we'll see about LCDs.  IoT is not only TI vs anti-TI.\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [September 3, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/772112433183727616)\n\nThis is the coffee shop: [https://t.co/0oaRq6yAEE](https://t.co/0oaRq6yAEE) Looking forward!\n\u2014 Kirby Urner (@4DsolutionsPDX) [September 3, 2016](https://twitter.com/4DsolutionsPDX/status/772113651159343104)",
