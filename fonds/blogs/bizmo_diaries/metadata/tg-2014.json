  "content": "Provided these blogs still have structural integrity, you will find a pattern around this time of year:\u00a0 a journey North to visit friends and relatives.\u00a0 This year, I drove alone, having I-5 adventures, with occasional forays into the hinterlands.\u00a0 Of course driving has changed now that smartphones plugged into the dash talk, giving directions, and play music.\n\nTara joined the eight of us by Google Hangout from Greater Chicago, for a video chat.\u00a0 Lee brought his parents, Howard and Wilma, along with Howard's brother Bill, to Mary's.\u00a0 Alice (Mary's sister) and Steven joined us from further north.\n\nWe found assembling the jigsaw puzzles congenial as they gave us something to focus on while having after dinner conversation.\u00a0 They were not run of the mill puzzles in that the pieces were unusually intricate, sometimes detailed shapes in their own right.\n\nI drove north on Wednesday and south on Friday, stopping by Bill's place for the first time near the University of Washington, the day of the annual football game, Huskies (University of Washington) versus Washington State.\n\nMany of our conversations were quite lighthearted, others serious in terms of topic, such as end of life planning.\u00a0 Mary is a doctor and wanted to be sure we were all aware of the agony some go through if the paperwork does not allow them to die and they can't represent themselves.\n\nMy love to friends and relatives out there, both near to me and far.\u00a0 We are one interwoven web of life, empirically as well as spiritually.\u00a0 There's not much to argue about there.\u00a0 The devil is in the details I suppose.",
