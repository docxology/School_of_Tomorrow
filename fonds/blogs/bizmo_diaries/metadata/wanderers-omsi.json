  "content": "OMSI is our local science and industry museum, of which I've always been a fan, since I was single digit, age-wise.\u00a0 By now I'm almost sixty, and OMSI has moved, having been near Oregon Zoo in the old days.\u00a0 Packy the elephant, a resident of said zoo, and I, are about the same age.\u00a0 He's not doing well, bad case of TB.\u00a0 I remember first seeing pictures of TB germs at OMSI. Small world.\n\nOur speaker  tonight, Dr. Sarah Schaack, was well practiced, having appeared in ten previous science pubs, or the like.\u00a0 It's called a \"science pub\" because yes, they let us bring beer to our seats.\u00a0 These were the really steep seats of the movie theater, originally Omnimax, now branded 4K and no longer projecting on a curved screen.\u00a0 Quite the remodel.\n\nOur topic: the human genome (and the genomes of other animals), its sequencing, what it is, why it matters and so on.\u00a0 Given the gigantic screen and super high resolution projector, we were treated to a Powerpoint on steroids.\u00a0 Our Reed College professor needed to gaze up at three story high slides from close range, and not lose her balance.\n\nDon consulted with a few of us Wanderers, before announcing this experiment, in which we would forego meeting at our usual location, the Linus Pauling House, and congregate at OMSI instead.\u00a0 Glenn and I road with Barry in his Mustang, who fought his way to our zip code through rush hour.\n\nSpeaking of Barry, I take care of a python (as in snake) by the same name, here in my office-plex.\u00a0 I decided to give his aquarium a thorough cleaning today, and somewhere in the process, cut a knuckle, leaving a visible wound, upon which the human Barry later commented.\n\nMy mind was already drifting along the day-dream of gene transfer, me absorbing some snake genes through the cut.\u00a0 That could only be mythographical, like what happened to Peter Parker in Spiderman (horizontal transport -- one of the warm-up quiz questions).\n\nThe human genome, especially the Y chromosome, is enlarged with a library of what we might call transient sequences, not part of the active protein-encoding version, more like skipped code, a wasteland in some accounts, a valuable repository in others. \n\nI'm reminded of human language and the many memeplexes that lay dormant, possible, even potential, but not much expressed.\u00a0 Diversity lays dormant, between the lines.\u00a0 Humans are packed with such \"detritus\" which may be our salvation in the long run.\n\nThe talk was free-ranging, if bound by the slides.\u00a0 The Q&A afterward was even more so.\u00a0 Portland has a rather science-savvy subculture.\u00a0 Lots of geeks have moved here.\u00a0 They don't call this the Silicon Forest for no reason, and genomics seems a branch of bioinformatics in many ways.\n\nAfter PCR, this process called CRISPR is the next big breakthrough. I missed an ISEPP lecture on that topic.\u00a0 We learned about the patent war and what's at stake with that.\u00a0 Geeks are always explaining to other geeks about one intellectual property war or another.\u00a0 The cost of sequencing has been plummeting.\u00a0 Now we're getting better at synthesis, not just analysis.\n\nWe learned about daphnia, somewhat ugly critters that pass DNA from one generation to the next asexually, unless under pressure.\n\nMutations sound like a bad thing to most ears, however most are considered harmless, and every so often the new sequence may be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nWe don't have all the big data we'd need to really cross-correlate genetic sequences to phenotypes, meaning profiles.\u00a0 You need more than just a pile of genetic sequences to discover links to whatever traits.\u00a0 We have a long way to go with our analysis.\n\nWe had a talk on genotype / phenotype matching at [@OMSI](https://twitter.com/OMSI) last night.
