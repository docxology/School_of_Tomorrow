Both these open source projects have served as valuable opportunities for talented coders to evolve the technology of the Object Database as a breed.\n\n[](https://www.flickr.com/photos/kirbyurner/16140315443/in/photolist-rBueeZ-qAgksK-pgpCsf-8EDKQK-8teDJ4-7HuR6q-7jQ3cJ-5YaqXF-5DoFbK-5f542z)\n\n\u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0441\u044c!",
