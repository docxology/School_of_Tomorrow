I sat in my car in the driveway to get the whole thing, having returned from the elementary school in the blog post below.\n\nA strong president needed input from Intelligence Chiefs, with the word \"chief\" clearly resonating with N8V American tribes and their chiefdoms (\"fire chief\" is in there also).\u00a0 Lots of them.\n\nToday was warm and Spring-like (because it's Spring). Glenn knocked on my door, arousing me from REM sleep.\u00a0 He was on his way to Willamette Week on his bicycle, upset that Oregon Theater\u00a0on Division was littering sidewalks with flyers, not even bothering to staple them to phone poles.\n\nUpper Hawthorne was awash with these things.\u00a0 He picked them up, which took some hours.\u00a0 I discovered the same littering phenomenon along Foster, and [took some pictures](https://flic.kr/p/JrDDQh).\n\nI also photographed the spanking new rollercoaster at Oak's Park.\u00a0 I'd read about it, and now got to see it for myself.\u00a0 It's brand new and in pristine condition.\u00a0 The park was not open, but pedestrians are welcome to mill about.\u00a0 I walked the bike closer for a better view.\n\nMy meet-up on Foster was in part about Australian history, today being Battle of Gallipoli Day.\u00a0 Or maybe that was yesterday.\u00a0 I'm doing some research on it now, and thinking of the movie Churchill and his reluctance, per that narrative, to sign on to the Normandy campaign.\n\nWe talked about the actor George C. Scott.\u00a0 I was right that he starred in Day of the Dolphin (\"man is bad\").\n\nMost interesting was my discussion with an expert in Icelandic culture in medieval times, the educational institutions in particular.\u00a0 I queried him about the Scandinavian spin on [this word \"troll\"](https://youtu.be/nhlBbHw_fgs) which is much in the news lately.\n\nInternet Research Agency out of St. Petersburg was deemed a \"troll farm\" by the FBI, but I didn't see Cambridge Analytica getting cast as a \"troll farm\" despite its openly bragging about its meddling in the 2016 election via Facebook.\u00a0 Why the double standard?\u00a0 Are Russians more troll-like than Brits?\u00a0 Evidently.\n\nAs it turns out, trolls were badass anti-heroes that added spice to a family tree.\u00a0 If you were a weighty House in Norway, you might proudly proclaim some troll blood in your veins.\n\nI'm reminded of how Neanderthals are in vogue today.\u00a0 Good news if your genetic profile suggests you're not just a plain vanilla Cro-Magnon.\u00a0 How bland.\n\nOf course I'm aware the term \"troll\" has developed its own meaning in the context of the Internet.\u00a0 There's also the verb form \"to troll\" which roughly means \"to bait\" or even \"to tease\".",
