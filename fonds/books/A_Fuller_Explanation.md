# A Fuller Explanation: The Synergetic Geometry of R. Buckminster Fuller

*A Fuller Explanation* is a comprehensive analysis and explanation of [[Buckminster_Fuller|R. Buckminster Fuller]]'s geometric principles and [[Synergetics]] concepts, written by [[Amy_C_Edmondson]] and published in 1987.

## Overview

The book serves as an accessible guide to understanding Fuller's complex geometric and philosophical ideas, particularly those presented in [[Synergetics]] and [[Synergetics_2]]. Edmondson, who worked as Fuller's last "Chief of Staff," brings clarity to his challenging concepts through careful explanation and illustration.
